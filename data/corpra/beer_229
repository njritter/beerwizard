The aroma is very prominent, calling to mind coffee, green pepper, and cocoa powder.  The flavour starts out with a bold coffee bitterness, branching out into some sweeter chocolate, with toffee, caramel, and a finish that really brings out a flavour of espresso.  The feel is silky smooth, with gorgeous texture going down.  The hype is real, stout fans. 418 charactersD-HopSupreme, Apr 29, 2017

3.99/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Traditional optics, perhaps could have presented a larger cap. Aroma is nice, there is a foundation of classic dark malt with the coffee added ontop, but it isn't brusque or grabbing, rather a smooth roasted South American style smell. Taste is maybe a tad more curt, but along the same lines, though the boldness & bitterness of the end was a little much. There is a whisper of that green pepper / vegetal taste you get from some coffee beers but nothing egregious. There are notes of espresso & warm nut to support the coffee & roasted (near burnt) malt. A little rough around the edges but a good coffee beer nonetheless. 624 charactersajm5108, Apr 25, 2017

palate follows very closely - intensely roasty, but all of the bold notes come together cohesively, creating a really complex and enjoyable brew. up front is an earthy and slightly bitter dark chocolate, into espresso and roasty coffee notes, slight bitterness is balanced by sweeter chocolate and caramel - as well as some fluffy vanilla/marshmallow type thing. mouthfeel is medium-full and has excellent texture .. almost sludgy!! 806 charactersHyptochrons, Apr 13, 2017

Pours black with a small, dark tan head. 
The smell is pure espresso, like sticking your nose into a bag of fresh coffee beans.
The taste follows the nose, dominated by coffee. Roasted malts and coffee bitterness mask the high ABV. Espresso flavors linger on the tongue long after the beer is finished. The feel is thick.
This is beer for coffee lovers. It's fantastic, probably the best coffee beer I have come by. I plan on grabbing a couple more, one for now and one to age! 549 charactersMaestro0708, Mar 10, 2017

M-Thin-moderate chewiness, slightly syrupy with a clean finish.  Very minimal carbonation

And as good as Peche Mortel is, I cannot believe there are 70 American Imperial Stouts rated ahead of it.
While I've seen an AIS look like this before and while the coffee/chocolate aromas meld well, I may not have tasted one as smooth as Peche Mortel. It is as rich in the mouth as an RIS ... and the alcohol is subdued.
I shied away from this because I don't like to think about doing things that can cause death.
By being so cautious, look what I missed.... and what I hope to Have again. 599 charactersBeginner2, Feb 12, 2017

4.17/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Shiny Orc's blood with a tan, creamy, dense head.
Smell is really chocolately at first, with roasted nuts and smokey malt too. It then develops to an almost oaky smell. THEN a more fruity coffee aroma emerges as it warms further, and this wasn't fresh. To think the bouquet I might get when it's right off the line.
Taste is roasty, almost smoked malt. Then chocolate comes in--both dark chocolate and malted milk balls. A woody taste then develops, and slowly the nutty coffee emerges.
Feel is kind of thin with minimal froth, finishing semi-dry. The thinness is surprising considering the depth of roast and color.
I really want a fresh one of these. As it warms, this is the most rapidly changing beer I think I've had over such a short period of time. And it manages to accomplish this in an enjoyable way. 814 charactersSabtos, Jan 26, 2017

4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25This has been a long-time want of mine. Finally got my hands on a bottle @$6.99. Bottled 12/2015, drank 12/2016, so about a year spent in the fridge.
A - An indelicate pour out of the bottle, at fridge temperature into my Duvel tulip produced an opaque black liquid with a nice tan head of tight, bubbles. The head receded from a finger's width to a thin ring, that sat nicely atop the liquid for quite a while. Spotty lacing noted where the liquid had been. Swirling regenerates the head quite impressively.
S - Like a shot of fresh espresso. Amazing that even after a year since bottling, the coffee aromas are so pronounced and sharp. I am getting some chocolate malt, but all of that is secondary to the espresso bomb that this beer is.
T - Yes, straight out espresso with a few chunks of sugar cubes thrown in. Coffee, very good coffee, some alcohol and traces of fruitiness towards the end. The bitterness is again all from coffee grounds.
M - Medium. The plentiful carbonation keeps this beer light and drinkable throughout the course.
O - Of all the coffee-inspired/infused stouts I've had, Peche Mortel is clearly one of the top examples. While the beer may seem mostly one-note, it nails that note perfectly. The hype is real. 1,236 charactersgshak, Jan 01, 2017

L - Inky black with beige 2 finger head that settles quickly to a thin layer of carb
A - Cofee, toffee, ilk chocolate, licorice, roasted malt
T - Taste follows aroma closely
F - Nice coating mouth feel, but more medium bodied (more KBS than BCBS).  Low carbonation with a slight alcohol warmth.  
O - A great beer with flavors that play nicely together and no slap in the face by any one flavor.  Mouth feel is a bit light, but not a big drawback.  Would buy again, and would love to try BA version. 519 charactersMtn, Nov 21, 2016

A - poured into a snifter. Typical dark cola colored stout with a frothy light mocha colored 1/2 inch head. It looks VERY syrupy and sweet leading me to believe it'll have a thick chewy mouthfeel. 
S - It smelled stellar as soon as I cracked the beer. Mostly of potent and fresh coffee, which is surprising because this beer is not fresh, nor should it necessarily be fresh. Bringing the glass to the nose I also smell bittersweet chocolate, creamed coffee (or perhaps more of a latte aroma), a faint earthiness reminiscent of a fresh rain or even overturned topsoil, there is a load of tobacco smoke that smells like a room recently inhabited by cigar smokers.
T - Okay. I don't get it. It taste like stale coffee, bakers chocolate, burnt barley, and too many noble hops. How is this top 100? I traded for this? This is founders breakfast stout that was brewed with week old instant coffee in a trailer park brewery.
M - It's dry. It's above average carbonated. It's not terribly full but not thin either. It leaves me letdown from my hopes of what it would be after the pour, but it's not a poor mouthfeel either.
O - I don't get it. Is this just one of the first coffee stouts that was around, and was originally very good for containing it's unique adjunct that it got a great reputation? I've had easily a dozen coffee stouts that are far superior to this. Very unimpressed. 1,414 charactersrypkr, Nov 18, 2016

Assertive aroma with predominant notes of roasted coffee beans, Belgian chocolate and licorice.
Flavor with notes of bitter coffee, a bit of lactic acid, cocoa powder, vanilla, plums, a good deal of hops, mild char, cigar, blueberries, molasses and black currant. Quite dry and bitter aftertaste with a lasting roasted note. 
Velvety medium to full body with mild carbonation with tiny bubbles. Alcohol of 9.5% is very well disguised.
Hoppy and bold Coffee RIS with true coffee notes and good dark complexity. Well attenuated, which contributes to show well its dark side. 648 charactersFLima, Oct 22, 2016

Appearance - Pours dark brown with tan edges.  LaciInf is minimal and doesn't linger when drinking.  
Smell - The aroma hits on notes of deep roast, baker's chocolate, a bit of dark juice and a touch of molasses. Some cream once the brew warms.
Taste - Follows the nose. Tons of coffee roast and both dark and milk chocolate.  An underlying note of dark berry. Some caramel and creaminess mid-taste, then some coffee bean bitterness that cuts the sweetness and delivers a fairly balanced finish. 
Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with low carbonation.
Overall - An excellent coffee-infused imperial.  Second time I've had it. Solid stout that I wish was available here more often. 704 charactersJay_P22, Oct 10, 2016

Appearance - Pours black with cola brown edging where light can penetrate. The head peaks at about a half a finger's width and dissipates fairly, revealing a thin, broken layer of suds across the surface. Lacing is small and spotty, most of which slides back down into the drink after a minute or so.
Smell - The aroma hits on notes of deep roast, baker's chocolate, a bit of dark fruit and a touch of molasses.  Some cream once the brew warms.
Taste - Follows the nose. Tons of coffee roast with both dark and milk chocolate upfront and throughout. An underlying note of dark berry character. Some caramel and creaminess mid-taste, then coffee bean bitterness cuts the sweetness and delivers a fairly punchy finish.
Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with low carbonation. Smooth, but a bit thin in the finish.
Overall - An excellent coffee-infused impy that does not disappoint. Definitely one I'll keep an eye out for whenever I'm in an area that gets distro. 984 charactersTheSixthRing, Oct 09, 2016

Pitch black color with a classy lil but rich of colour head.
Smell is coffee and a bit of chocolate; tastes like a take away coffee, but in the best way possible. hops are present too and they do the job to balance the coffee bitterness.
Low carbonation and good body wich make this a deangerous sipper, i had two of these and could have drunk more even though the almost 10%abv. Very well done but watch out if you aren't a coffee fun. 465 charactersDispyDnb, Oct 07, 2016

I've drank a TON of coffee infused beers/stouts.. If I could rate this one a 100%+, 5+, I would.. I love KBS. I love FBS. I love BCBS. I love SMS etc etc..
This beer, without being barrel aged, is (dare I say) the BEST coffee infused beer I have ever tasted. It looks beautiful in a snifter. It smells divine.. And the taste? Full bodied, intense espresso roast, dark fruit.. BOMB!
Get your hands on this one if you can. A Canadian gem of a brewery making one of THE finest imperial stouts you will ever sample..

Smell is dark! French roast coffee and bittersweet cocoa.
Taste follows the nose. Heavy on darker roasty flavors, almost smokey at times. Lingering bitterness. Very nice! Enough sweetness but definitely not a sweet thick beer, with a bitter finish that balances the sweet alcohol.. Rather European in execution, and a good example of that approach. 405 charactersPDXAmbassador, Sep 04, 2016

The smell is tons of roasted coffee; somewhat overpowering if you're looking for more, but for coffee lovers, this hits the spot.  The taste is much like the description.  It is a very bitter coffee as opposed to the normal sweet coffee stouts.  This is only about 6 months old, and I could see it developing with time.   The feel is a bit thin compared to what it poured like.  
It is a pretty refreshing take on the coffee stout.  It is well balanced between the sweet and bitter -- it reminds you that you're still drinking a beer. 642 charactersnawpnawp, Aug 04, 2016

Taste is roasty with coffee being the overwhelming flavor. Maybe a little sweet malts and chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium, but not as creamy as I like for big stouts. Overall, a very good beer and I would definitely drink again. 329 charactersdaudelin2000, Jul 20, 2016

The bottle was from a small depayssant. Bottled in May. Drank it in July.
The smell was this beer's highlight for me. Very much enjoyed and appreciated this beer. I especially liked the rich oatlike scent that intermingled with the coffee (or was it just grainy coffee). I was impressed.
I wasn't overwhelmed, however. There is high praise for this beer, and I just wonder if others like it have come along since its initial release. That said, I felt the espresso scent and flavor were unique, rich and complex. Wholly worthwhile. 629 charactersbraker649er, Jul 20, 2016

12oz screw cap (!) served between a pair of Georgetown samplers.
Pours black with no head and little carbonation. Smell is coffee, licorice, toffee, more licorice.
Taste is so much softer than I expected. I expected an in-your-face dark beer assault, but instead I got a sneaky dark beer infiltration perpetrated by my best friend. Velvety, chocolate, black licorice, sweetened coffee, hints of dark fruits.
Mouthfeel is silky and nice. Overall, very good beer, happy that I finally got to try it. 511 characterssnaotheus, Jul 18, 2016

4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bought in a 4 pack for about $15 can. Tasted by itself. Should pair well with anything that has balsamic vinegar. Also dark chocolate cake. 
Looks like a stout, totally opaque almost black with a medium brown foamy head that melts to a 1/2 in. ring. Some sticky lacing.
Smells like a cold espresso. Also hot chocolate.
Tastes like a heavenly mix of chocolate, strong coffee, toasted malts and dark ale. Very sweet and alcoholic but still so easy to want to empty the glass... and open another.
It goes down so smooth it is sinful.The after taste is quite bitter but just requires you  to take another sip.
There is nothing bad I could say about  this. Not something to drink in quantity on a summer afternoon maybe.
But if you can find it, try it. I love this style of beer and Péché  Mortel is one of the best ones I have tried. 831 charactersPoljazz22, Jul 15, 2016

Look: Dark with a ruby color on the edges. No head at all.
Smell: Very malty, coffee, chocolate, roast malt, 
Taste: Dark fruit, coffee, chocolate, roast malt, cacao, caramel. 
Feel: The alcohol burn is present, but the flavor stays.
So overall would I recommend it? Yes, this is a very well made beer that you can definitely enjoy but no more than 2 bottles in 1 day. 456 characterskevofficiel, Jul 05, 2016

4.27/5  rDev -3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Bottle dated 1/2016:
Pours a deep brown, obviously not but close to black.  Head grew medium on a medium soft pour.  Supernova of bubbles remain on the surface for a while.  Medium ring of tan head also, sheets of lacing.
Nose is a bit light on strong roasted coffee (not sure if 5 months matter).  However, the aroma of malts I do get lean towards coffee.  There's a nutty roastiness, as well as a hint of chocolate.  With warmth, the smell becomes a bit more like a diner coffee - definite coffee aroma, but not a deep profile.
First off, this is a wonderful stout.  A nice little bit of char atop a classic dark roasted malt profile.  Coffee is detectable but isn't the main component in this pour.  I actually get a little chocolate in the taste as well, the net result is more like a lightly flavored mocha.
There is a roasted bitterness that isolated comes off a little hay-like.  The beer rolls over the tongue easily, leaving a little charred note at the back of the tongue in rememberence.  If I let the beer sit for just a second, it actually seems to add a little silkiness to the feel.  Little more than medium boldness, but seems less heavy than that might indicate.
A wonderful stout, for sure.  I wish the coffee were a little bolder from a "coffee stout" standpoint, but cannot deny how well made the beer itself is. 1,336 characterscjgiant, Jun 21, 2016

4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This 9.5% imperial stout pours a pitch black color with a fairly small creamy tan head. The smell is fairly strong and is predominantly a delicious roast coffee scent. The flavor is really excellent roast espresso all the way with a little bit of dark chocolate. It’s very creamy and rich with a nice smooth finish that lingers a little bit, but isn’t at all cloying. The body is not surprisingly heavy, but I have tried stouts that were a little heavier. It’s a really amazing coffee stout. The only thing that would keep it from being at the very top of the imperial stouts category is that it’s a little one dimensional with respect to flavor though I have to say it is amazingly delicious nonetheless. It’s rightfully very well rated in my opinion. 762 charactersBierliebhaber3, Jun 08, 2016

aroma-Roasted malts, rich coffee, and dark chocolate.

feel- Medium/full body, low carbonation, bitter, dry, and not easy to drink.
overall- Big disappointment here.  I'm a big fan of coffee stouts, but this is too bitter and lacks balance.  The coffee flavors are solid but its like drinking straight black coffee. 583 charactersCTbrew32, May 27, 2016

4.29/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Pours black as sin and oily. Thick pillowy coffee brown head that slowly dissipates eventually leaving only a lacing on the glass and a thick foamy ring around the outside of the beer. 
Smell is rich bitter coffee grinds and roasted malts. Not a ton of complexity, but it smells really good.
Taste is initially masked by slight carbonation, but as the tingle wears off you get this rich array of chocolate, freshly ground coffee, dark chocolate covered espresso beans, and roasted malts before giving way to a bitter espresso finish. Really a phenomenal array of flavors. Dark, rich, and roasty. 
Feel is initially medium carbonation providing a slight tingle on the tongue. The stout is thick, buttery smooth, velvety and very nice. Great heft on this one.
Overall an outstanding Russian Imperial Stout. I don't feel like this is a coffee stout as much as an imperial stout that uses coffee to produce a rich roasted bitterness. Really good. I will certainly be revisiting this one again in the future. 1,007 charactersFBarber, May 14, 2016

Big notes of roasted malt and coffee in the aroma. Almost like walking into a coffee shop. A little bit of toffee in there as well. Taste is very much coffee forward - which itself is done well. The coffee doesn't taste charred, burnt, or over-roasted. Roasted malts and toffee fill out the rest of the flavor profile. Mouth feel is bold, thick, creamy, and mouth coating. Absolutely delightful. Not picking up any grainy-ness. Overall, a sublime coffee beer. Simply put: it must be tried. It was one of my first coffee beers when I got into craft, and revisiting it a year later I'm picking up more subtle flavors. Such a delightful brew.

Dark, rich color with little carbonation and a half finger of caramel colored head. Rich tones of coffee, roasted malts and chocolate are apparent and the first taste does not disappoint! Roasted Expresso coffee on the front gives way to malts and hint of chocolate. This is not as full-bodied as expected; very enjoyable. Truly a beer to be savored. 415 charactersOompaMentor, May 02, 2016

Wow. Intense aroma.  Coffee and smokiness are the big players. Some hints of chocolate too.
Follows the nose to a T.  The coffee is the prominent flavor. Dark roast or espresso. Big, bold flavor. The smokiness is well-done. The best use of it that Ican recall in a beer, but I don't tend to like smokiness so take that for what it's worth.
Mouthfeel- Medium feel with light carbonation.
Overall- This is an intense stout. If you like coffee stouts, you need to try this one. Normally I don't care for smokiness in my beers but this one pulls it off. 617 charactersBrew_42, Apr 28, 2016

Coffee and lactose are heavy on the nose, with an alcohol background.  The taste is coffee up front with a chocolate sweetness to follow, and a burnt malt bitter finish.  The mouthfeel is velvet, and it coats the palate.  A very enjoyable coffee stout experience, but a bit overpriced when considering the vast number of cheaper alternatives.  With that said, I'd really like to try the BBA variant. 470 charactersMJSFS, Apr 14, 2016

Appearance: Jet black with a tan head that quickly disperses, but leaves behind some nice spotted lacing around the glass.  
Aroma: Notes of espresso, dark chocolate, and roasted malts dominate. A whisper of sweet vanilla and alcohol dissipates behind. 
Taste: Explosive savory coffee flavors overwhelm at first. Mid pallet is more coffee accompanied by burnt dark chocolate, sweet roasted malts, and almonds. Beer is incredibly well balanced in terms of sweetness, and hop bitterness that results in a lot of play among the subtle, and dominant flavors that are trying to assert themselves. Finish is slightly dry, with a pleasant muted sour espresso tang. The remnants of the last sip will linger, throughout. 
Mouthfeel: Just shy of full bodied, but chewy and smooth, just the same. Low carbonation. 
Overall: Deceptively drinkable at 9.5% ABV. No doubt one of the greatest representations of the coffee stout style, and a benchmark for others looking to create their own imperial stout expression. 1,105 charactersNerd_Diamond, Apr 12, 2016

4.11/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Of all the beers I've had of this ilk (and that's quite a few), this is probably the most coffee-forward of the group.  Impressive, since it appears to have been bottled a year ago, though perhaps the label-notches are off by a year...?
As black as black can be with a heavy body and low carbonation, this bad boy immediately blasts bitter coffee flavors into your nostrils, over your tongue, down your palate, and lingers on the back of your throat for...451 characters so far.  As the label suggests, it's one to enjoy slowly, and a bit more chilled than I'd normally put an imperial stout.  Feels just right, and not too slick or oily.  A bit more head would have been nice, though honestly, this one has plenty of aroma anyway.
There are some notes of oatmeal, roasted malts with a hint of smoked porter-like flavor, but this is really first and foremost a coffee stout.  I personally prefer a bit more balance, so being subjective here, I can't say I like it as much as Founders Breakfast Stout, Avery Tweak, or Hardywood Sidamo, for example, but if you want in-your-face bitter coffee stout with a gnarly kick and plenty of heat, this is the way to go! 1,160 charactersjmasher85, Apr 06, 2016

Appearance: It poured a deep dark brown, near black colour with a less than one finger tanned head that disappears fairly quickly but leaves nice small spotty lacing.
Aroma: Strong coffee, espresso, sweet black cherry and vanilla, roasty malts and a hint of dark chocolate.
Taste: Very nice coffee, roastiness, lightly charred with a finish that is a lingering dark chocolate bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Smooth velvety, full bodied with low carbonation.
Overall: Very nice coffee stout that I could drink again and again. Will definitely age a few bottles since it does suggest that on the back label. Would also love to try a barrel-aged version of this bad boy. 754 characterskitch, Mar 31, 2016

World class nose of rich roast, strong coffee, chocolate and a solid malt base with caramel.
Perfectly smooth and creamy full body, but done with an artful  brewers light touch.  World class carbonation with an effervescent middle and a prickly punch in the finish that tickles the tongue.  The carbonation/body balance is a masterpiece.
The flavor profile is high end world class.  The balance of this beer is a masterpiece.  The complex flavor profile arrives in a blended fashion then slowly separates.  The intensity of each flavor is so perfectly balanced that none can dominate, yet all arrive for their moment of glory but never completely fall from the palate.  Underneath is a rich malt sweetness that accelerates in intensity and peaks at the finish in a rich caramel blast.  The more assertive flavors arrive first (coffee, roast) then taper to the moderate flavors (chocolate, anise).  The middle is slightly bitter from roast, coffee and hops plus a touch of char.  As the finish approaches, the char aspect fades into smoke like a ghost fading away.  The 9% alcohol remains completely covered but gives itself away in the dry finish, which is quite a difficult brewing task.  The finish lingers with shifting flavor sensations that encompass the full range of complexity.  This is the beer that all stouts should be measured against.  It simply, is the best. 1,464 characterstillmac62, Mar 17, 2016

Pours nearly perfect black with faintly glittering cola edges and a thin cap of brown head that leaves melting ice palace lace as it recedes.
Smells of fresh ground coffee, espresso, dark chocolate, black cherry, new leather, cigar box, and faint earthy hops.
Tastes like coffee should taste. Dark roasted coffee with some cream, toasted brown sugar, nutty dark chocolate, dried black cherry, mild sweet licorice and more earthy green hops.
Feels creamy and fluffy. Medium-full bodied with mild carbonation. Finishes long and bitter.
Verdict: Vigorously recommended. If you like beer and coffee, you should submerge yourself in this as soon as possible. 690 charactersHat_Fulla_Beer, Mar 05, 2016

4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Weird bottling date so i have no clue how old. 
Appearance: Great label art; not a fan of the twist off bottle though. Poured medium thickness with a firm tan head that appeared creamy. Black as night with no light passing through. 
Nose: massive coffee hit, chocolate, bakers cocoa, deep roasted malt, complex
Taste: coffee, smooth, complex, chocolate, coffee, coffee, slightly boozy, slick mouthfeel, some dark fruits and sweetness, delicious
Overall: real treat here. I've been waiting to try this one and it does not disappoint. I wish the bottling dates were better. Mine seems to indicate 01/2002 but that can not be true. I think I'll drink the other one I bought soon. It's too good to cellar and I think the coffee will drop out. Wonderful. 753 charactersClavisAurea, Feb 21, 2016

4.51/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From bottle into mini-snifter.
This surprised me, which is maybe some of the reason for the higher score.  Pour isn't exactly motor oil black but it's nice and dark.  Smell is very surprising in a positive way!  First whiff reminded me of a 2 year cellared BCBCS '13.  Taste is also full of coffee abundance.  The one thing that does trial a bit behind the look, smell, and taste is the mouth feel.  Not quite full bodied from what the initial impression would be, but by no mean 'light' or anything like that.  Very smooth.  No hint of alcohol or booziness.  
Overall a very good IS with coffee!  I would gladly get this without any hesitation. 647 characterseifster82, Feb 12, 2016

Bottle to goblet. Look: oily black pour, small head. Thick looking stout. Aroma : strong coffee, smoke. Coffee is a very dark aromatic. Taste is Dark coffee, deep roasted malt and roasted coffee beans....almost burnt, but enough sugars to keep it smooth. Dark chocolate. Deep down are some dark fruits and nutty flavors, but they are overwhelmed by the coffee. Feel is thick but light, minimal carbonation. Very tasty. Would love to try the bourbon barrel aged version.

Mouthful lighter than I expected but still appropriate for a stout.   
While I was slightly disappointed in the taste, this is still a rock solid coffee stout.  Just slight notch below victory at sea ( I know it's a porter) and bourbon county coffee.  Not in same league as good morning though .  That beer is in a class of its own 560 charactersjcflorian, Jan 04, 2016
4.16/5  rDev -5.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Poured at 50°F from an 11.5oz bottle (I couldn't decipher the bottling date even after looking into it. My bottle has a notched 1 on the left set of numbers and 0 and 2 notched on the right set of numbers. I highly doubt that this bottle traded to me is from January of 2002) into a Spiegelau stout glass. Consumed on 03Jan15.
LOOK: Pours with a fingers worth of cinnamon colored foam. At 15 seconds, the foam changes color to khaki, but remains the same in height. Finally after 2 minutes and 5 seconds, the foam head halves itself. Black in color with an orange tint. There is a massive amount of very small rising bubbles. Lacing is high in quantity and mainly thin with a few parts being thick. 
SMELL: Strong aromas of bitter roasted malts and coffee entangle with mild aromas of smoked goodness, black cherries, plums, and sweet chocolate along with subtle aromas of vanilla. A mild spicy and sour aroma similar to rye is also present. 
TASTE:  Strong coffee and bitter roasted malt flavors first strike the palate. Strong smokey flavors and subtle sweet chocolate flavors immediately follow. Mild vanilla and spicy/sour rye-like flavors continue the taste symphony. Subtle flavors of black cherries and plums enter lastly as all previous flavors persist, except for vanilla, which grow slightly stronger.
FEEL: Medium-bodied with hints of carbonation. Goes down smooth and creamy. Finishes with a mild dryness.
NOTE: Although this was very bitter, it was balanced out well by the coffee and vanilla. I would of liked to have tasted more chocolate and less smokiness. I love smoked flavors as much as the next guy, but they are not the best combination with the bitterness from the roasted malts in my opinion. 1,717 charactersMyotus, Jan 04, 2016

The smell is coffee, chocolate, and a bit of booze. The taste is roasted coffee and malt with a good amount of chocolate. The feel is very thick almost chewy but very smooth. This is wonderful beer and I can see why it is rated the way it is. I will be getting another bottle. 364 charactersMeyers1023, Jan 03, 2016

Nearly black brown color with 1 finger of thick tan head. Nose is strong in roasty notes and subtle coffee.  More coffee comes through in the taste,  one of the best coffee stouts I've had! Good body and mouthfeel,  with a slight bite on the finish.   My first and definitely not the last trip with this beer, damn good! 382 charactersjakecattleco, Jan 03, 2016
4.64/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle poured into a snifter.  Pours an opaque black with a half finger mocha head.  Nose is bitter chocolate, dark roast coffee, with an almost peppery bite.  Hints of black cherry linger here too.  The palate opens with a peppery, bitter dark chocolate note, that sweetens as it lingers.  As the beer warms, the alcohol presence becomes moderately more noticeable, and elements of oak become more prominent.  Mouthfeel is medium with minimal carbonation - thickens slightly as the beer warms.  Overall, an outstanding, subtle imperial stout.  Stays away from the sweetness of the big American Imp Stouts and focuses much more heavily on exploring the bitter and roasted side of this style.  Overall, an outstanding beer. 727 charactersLAp, Jan 03, 2016

jet black, sweet-sweet coffee nose, taste of liquid dark chocolate with a noticeable bitterness from coffee, which plays off the chocolate, making the dark chocolate "sweet" by comparison, so I get the odd sensation of "sweet dark chocolate" - impressed.  Mouthfeel is incredible - off the charts smooth for a medium-bodied beer whose taste would make you expect "heaviness", yet it drinks like a standard stout.  Beautiful simplicity here. 457 charactersBodiesLexus, Jan 01, 2016

Body is pitch black, light brown bubbles that spend little time on the surface before dissipating. Minimal lacing. Smells of dark roast coffee and sweet dark chocolate.  Excellent balance between the two.  Taste matches the aroma. The flavors get brighter as the beer warms.
Edit,  drinking 9 months from purchase, and it developed beautifully. When I first had it, it was a nice imperial stout but it didn't blow me away. Now it's fantastic. A nice smokiness now, coffee is still very forward but pleasant 560 charactersJordonHoltzman, Dec 27, 2015

A - A deep red/brown with one finger tan head and some sugar lacing
S - Acidic coffee, manure, soil, earthy hops, toasted/roasted everything, peat, sweet malts, dry grains, dark chocolate, rich tobacco, vanilla, anise, booze, smoke, wood and more coffee.
T - Huge smoke, peat, vanilla, coffee, booze, roasted grains/malts, sugar, anise, soil, tons of earth
M - Full bodied, nice balance, awesome complexity, medium plus acidity, medium carbonation and a crazy coffee and booze finish
D/O - Really nice. The coffee is huge but tastes completely natural. While some coffee stouts have a somewhat synthetic taste behind the coffee, this one here is very nice and tastes just like you think it should. The taste profiles nearly eclipse an over the top effort but in the best of ways. Really well done and perfect for anytime of year -- especially the winter season. Start a fire, crack one of these and get that roast into the oven. Awesome.
Final Thoughts - Not sure of the price as it was a gift but the almost 10% ABV is awesome. Grab one to enjoy and one to age -- it won't disappoint. 1,139 characterswhatthehull, Dec 25, 2015

Fresh robust coffee notes, complete with mild dark fruit and semi-sharp acidity, suggesting it was minimally roasted, rounded by well-roasted malt. The flavor is also sharp with coffee, accentuated by hops, bringing almost to a soy sauce level, but brought back from the brink by chocolaty roasted malt. Heavily coffee-dominated, yet still firmly in the beer department. Long finish is dry and bitter. Medium body, supple, perfectly inconspicuous carbonation that still livens it up.
Awesome expression of the coffee which definitely took the lead, to the point where it could replace an actual cup of joe. It was minimally roasted to give it a huge flavor profile, and supported by simple but well made roasted malt. Bordering on too acidic for my taste, but it was still firmly on the delicious side of things. 868 characters1000lbgrizzly, Dec 25, 2015

There is a sweet note to balance out the coffee bitterness. Full mouthfeel yet not cloying or sticky. Some dark chocolate in the aftertaste. Fantastic. 420 charactersBarnoloid, Dec 25, 2015

Appearance:
Pours outerspace black with a nice, fluffy mocha head which dies back quickly leaving a tight, sturdy ring of foam which endures to the end of the glass. No lacing to speak of.
Smell:
Mild. Smells of roasting coffee, and spicy, unsweetened chocolate.
Taste:
Espresso and molasses, roasted cocoa nibs and orchard fruits. Barely sweet at the start, dry, with a long, strong bitter finish. A delicious residue of charred malt, vanilla, tobacco and whiskey vapors lingers long after the last sip.
Feel:
Medium bodied, lightly carbonated, and oh, so creamy.
Overall:
A masterfully-executed stout, hits all the right notes for me: balanced, slightly bitter rather than sweet, dry rather than syrupy. One of my all time favorites. I've stocked up on it when I've been in Montréal and I'm dreading a day when it's all gone.
Note: I've had Péché Mortel on draft at Dieu du Ciel in Montréal and it is a religious experience - much as I love Péché from the bottle, comparing it to what comes from the tap is like comparing skim milk to whipping cream.  5's across the board there. 1,166 characterspapposilenus, Dec 17, 2015

Taste had  a touch of vanilla sweetness and dark chocolate but not overbearing. The coffee was king, this dog'll hunt. A non coffee lover may be turned off (or someone who can't drink coffee without +++cream&sugar) but I found the coffee taste to be direct and less of a booze bomb even with the 9.5%. Good mouthfeel but with less booziness, the complexity of the beer was evident. Certainly a refreshing quality with many of today's BBaged stouts getting completely out of hand these days and masking imperfections. I'd drink this any day of fall/winter, it's that good. 684 charactersDannyB, Dec 13, 2015

The stout is sweet and bitter with a ton of flavor, a lot like FBS but way more coffee forward and it beats BBB in coffee flavor. A fantastic coffee stout. 485 charactersjustinp444, Dec 10, 2015

Was expecting more from such a higher rated beer. This was just pretty standard and a little boozy.  Wish I could tell how old the bottle is.   
More alcohol warmth, good chewiness, coffee still largely absent (although I did have this after the excellent Sumatra stout coffee beer). . . some chocolate. Wondered about oats or honey in this. Seemed to be a coffee beer for people who don't like coffee. Simplistic, not aggressive. Did hide the alcohol, which is at a level which could be described as aggressive. A solid beer, but you can get Sierra Nevada stout, an entire 6 pack for about what this costs, and SN to me, is better.
At $6 a 12oz, there's so many better options out there. Thought the same brewery's aphrodite was superior to this one in almost every aspect, if not every.  Would revisit if I was certain it was a fresh ass bottle. 957 charactersrodbeermunch, Nov 27, 2015

4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I picked up a bottle of Dieu Du Ciel's Peche Mortel a couple weeks ago for $4.99 at The Lager Mill.  I've been wanting to try this beer for a long time and I'm glad it's now availble here, so lets see how it goes.  2015 Vintage.  Poured from a brown `12oz bottle into a teku.
A-  The label looks good, it's got a nice design and it's a little eye catching.  It poured a nice dark black color that didn't let any light come through and it had a half a fingers worth of dark tan brown head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left a little bit of spotty lacing behind.  This is a good looking beer, I have no complaints.
S-  The aroma starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness with the coffee being the first to show up and it imparts a nice black coffee like aroma.  Up next comes a little bit of fruity yeast coming through impart some dark fruit like aroma and it's followed by the malts which impart a chocolate, slightly charred and roasted malt aroma.  This beer has a good aroma, it's main;y what I would expect from a Coffee Stout, but the yeast holds back a little.  
T-  The taste seems to be similar to the aroma and it starts off with a lower amount of high sweetness with the voffee still being the first to show up  and it imparts the same black coffee aspect.  Up next comes that fruity yeast which is a little lighter than it was in the aroma which I like.  Up next comes the malts which imparts the chocolate and charred aspects that that they did in the aroma and there's a little bit of boozy flavor coming through.  On the finish there's a slightly higher amount of medium bitterness with nice coffee, chocolate and charred malt like aftertaste.  This is a good tasting Coffee Stout, I like how the yeast is a little more toned down.  
M-  Fairly smooth, on the lighter side of being full bodied, slightl cirsp a little creamy with a medium amount of carbonation.
Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style, it had all the aspects that I look for in a good Coffee stout, but in the end it was just a little rough around the edges and to me that's what held it back from being a world class coffee stout.  This beer had ok drinkability, one glass is the right amount for me, no need for anymore than that.  What I like the most about this beer is the how true to style it is, it's just what I look for in a coffee stout.  What I like the least about this beer is the higher bitterness and fruity yeast, I wish they were both toned down a little. I don't think i would buy this beer again, but I for sure wouldn't turn it down and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Coffee Stouts.  All in all I was happy with this beer, but given the hype around this beer, I wasn't as impressed as I thought I might, but it's still a good beer.  It made for a good first impression for this brewery and I'm interested to see what else they got and it's a good example of the style.  Good job guys this is a good Coffee Stout. 2,999 charactersStoutHunter, Nov 17, 2015

L - Black, only black, almost no head
S - coffee but mostly dark chocolate but as it warms up: raisin and nuts
T - So much more than coffee, it is obviously an espresso stout but it's much more complex. At first dark chocolate and coffee, but with some time, the hops come along, and you can taste resin, nuts, raisin. The bitterness is really high
F - small carbonation that goes along perfectly with the taste
O - an incredible brew! With a taste that goes deeper and deeper as it warms up 541 charactersBruno74200, Nov 16, 2015
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 16 oz snifter. Bottled in 3-15 notched on the side of the label.
Pours an onyx color (about 38-40 SRM) with a khaki colored head that hangs tough for a few minutes until dissipating. A magnificent lacing is present along the curves of the snifter as I sip. Great head retention present. 
Smells of roasted barley, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, spent coffee grounds, and a subtle black licorice or fennel. Epic nose on this brew! Truly amazing!
Tastes of bitter chocolate, dark roasted coffee, roast malts, and cocoa nibs. Very complex flavor and a awesome finish. I can taste this beer minutes after by licking my lips. The severe malt profile is balanced very well with hops during the boil. My estimate is that this beer clocks in at around 50-75 IBU due to the pleasant bitterness that follows. 
Feels smooth on the palate with a slight prickle from the low carbonation but balances out well. Initially this brew seems sweet, until you swallow and then you've got a case of "I just smoked 10 cigars" dry mouth from the bitterness. Definitely a party in your mouth.
Overall an awesome coffee stout that is not only well balanced, but leaves a flavorful finish after each sip that's powerful enough so that when you lick your lips 5-8 minutes after sipping while you type this review, you still pick up all the flavors. Get your hands on twelve of these and drink one a year for the next 12 years. I dare you...
Cheers!

4.61/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75341 ml bottle served cold into a tulip. Purchased a 4 pack from the LCBO for $13.25 CDN. Seeing as this is considered one of the best stouts in the world, finding it at the LCBO is a huge steal.
Appearance - pours an ominous black coloured beer, eradicating light along the way. Tiny head is poured that is tan coloured. Head retention is minimal and no lacing left behind.
Smell - fresh coffee dominates but there's a subtle sweet creamy aroma of some combination of caramel, cream and maybe cinnamon. Smells like a dessert on its own. Maybe a whisper of whiskey for good measure. Superb.
Taste - starts with fresh black coffee then turns vaguely sweet acknowledging the creamy, caramel aromas on the nose. Perhaps some vanilla and cinnamon too. Then reverts back to a black coffee flavor, very bitter with a trace of charcoal. Some alcoholic warmth on the close. Complex and delicious. Dark chocolate starts showing up big time as the beer warms.
Mouthfeel - smooth with modest carbonation and a robust but light mouthfeel. Alcoholic warmth kisses the tongue and slides down the hatch so easy. Dangerously drinkable.
Overall - a phenomenal imperial stout that doesn't disappoint. Closest approximation to another beer is Founders breakfast stout in terms of coffee intensity, with some delicious and subtle other flavours kicking around to give it a second and third layer of depth that most stouts can't match. Near perfection. 1,435 charactersDenisKolkin, Nov 14, 2015

4.39/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25$5.49 single 11.5oz bottle poured into an oversized Sam Adams Perfect Pint. Decided to dive in and see what all the fuss is about with this beer ... seems to be universally loved, so why not. I'm curious though -- why the hell did this beer have a twist top? Bizarre.
Appearance: Hard pour gave a slow forming, creamy brown head that settled in at about half a finger, surprisingly. This is a pitch black beer with no floaters or sediment. Not a lot of lacing on the glass.
Smell: Well damn. Seriously deep, dark roasted coffee and malt: nearly burned. Really like fresh roasted dark roast coffee. There might be the absolute faintest bit of alcohol, but it's very slight. There's a bit of a chocolate vibe in there as well, which seems inevitable in most stouts this big. I don't get any dark fruit or anything like that out of Peche Mortel though.
Taste/feel:  If you don't love the darkest of black coffees, don't bother with this beer -- it's intense, intense coffee throughout with a rich bitterness. The roasted malt gives it a little "extra something" so it doesn't taste just like a 10%, $5.49 cup of alcoholic coffee. As it warms up, the flavors becomes more discernible, and the beer tastes different from the start of the sip, to the end, to the finish. No doubt about it it's a whole lot of coffee, but with the malt... I don't know what it is. Something's magical about this beer. I really can't fathom its awesomeness if it were bourbon barrel aged. The feel is moderate in body, with a surprisingly light, but actively prickly carbonation, which accentuates the coffee very nicely.
To be honest, this reminds me quite a bit of Founders Breakfast Stout, with less of a chocolate presence, less sweetness, and a less full mouthfeel ... but a couple bucks more expensive per bottle. Comparing it to that beer, since I see a lot of similarities, this beer falls short, but it is still damn awesome and nearly as good for different reasons. Worth a try for sure, despite the premium pricetag. 2,006 charactersSerialTicker, Nov 02, 2015

This was poured into a snifter.
The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a one finger white to off white foamy head. Thin stringy lacing slides into the beer.
The smell has a super nice blend of dark roasted cocoa beans to a nice sweet milk chocolatey goodness. Light coffee beans enter in a subtle bitter yet roasty balanced way.
The taste started off sweet and warmed into a nice blend with the roasty and the bitter components. Cocoa lends a hand to the aftertaste nicely and leads into a dry sweet finish.
The mouthfeel sharpens with the roast and the bitter to eloquently deliver a quick punch on my tongue, still showing a medium body with a fantastic sipping quality. Carbonation feels subtle.
Overall, wow, what a fantastic Double/Imperial stout, now this one really delivers in all aspects. I'm really gonna savor that other bottle and hopefully open it up for a special occasion. 1,024 charactersSitkaSteve, Nov 02, 2015

Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toast, dark bread, light smoke/char, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, coffee, and moderate earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of huge dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toast, dark bread, light smoke/char, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Large amount of herbal/pine/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toast, dark bread, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, coffee, and moderate earthy hop flavors; with a nice roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Good amount of dryness from roasted bitterness as well. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/sticky, and lightly silky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Russian imperial coffee stout. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, and moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering. 1,697 characterssuperspak, Oct 31, 2015

A - Pitch black, with mahogany edging and a cappuccino head that quickly recedes into a filmy cap. Extensive lacing is left behind on the glass.
S - Hazelnut coffee in abundance. Wow, absolutely redolent of coffee beans and caramel macchiato and creme brulee. This is the best-smelling coffee beer I've encountered.
T - Not nearly as sweet as the nose suggests, this actually brings the bitter coffee, which nicely compliments the roasted malts and earthy hops. The hazelnuts and some bittersweet morsels and torched brulee add some depth, and the finish is lingering, but not at all cloying.
M - Lively carbonation props up the medium body, and keeps the sips coming.
There's a large disconnect between the nose and the palate here, but it works and this one is worth the hype. 852 charactersAJacob81, Oct 24, 2015

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip:
Appearance: intensely dark brown, bordering on black but not as deathly oily as some imperial stouts. Still, very obsidian color.
Aroma: layer upon layer of the typical stout scents.....espresso roast, chocolate, amongst other rich, decadent layers. Really appetizing and dessert-y smelling.
Taste: terrific notes of coffee, which is easily the dominant flavor here. Not much sweetness, but the beer isn't "hot" like some higher percentage brews. The focus is coffee, and the beer delivers in that regard...tons of roastiness and complexity, with a nice bitter finish. Not nearly as sweet as the predominant flavors in imp. stouts that are popular today, but delicious and extremely well-balanced.
Feel: thick and smooth, but not sticky. Really grew into a delicious, decadent experience as it warmed. Heavy body with only mild carbonation.
Overall: an incredible stout, one of the best non-BA stouts available. Wish it was more readily available in New England. 1,007 charactersTheElectricOne, Oct 22, 2015

-Roasted coffee, slight bittersweet chocolate, slight alcohol
-Again...roasted coffee with slight bitter chocolate notes, espresso, not picking up any sweetness
-Full mouthfeel and creamy.

L: Nice, mocha, lacy head. Doesn't hang long in any meaningful way, but lingers around the edge.
S: My girlfriend and I both detected chiles, like it was a Mexican stout, at first. But that's not an adjunct used, it seems. Definitely some kind of spice. Coffee is there too, obviously.
T: Roasty, roasty, roasty. Bitter coffee finish. Tastes less like brewed coffee, more like coffee beans before the brew with all that bitterness intact. All the bitterness of the beer tastes like it's from the coffee rather than the hops.
F: That bouncy, liquid metal feel that I look for in an American style stout. 
O: Very good. Not hugely memorable, but very good. 702 charactersMichaelNeelsen, Oct 19, 2015

Dieu du Ciel says at the bottle: ABV: 9.5% Extra strong stout brewed with coffee - Just what I like! 
The beer pours pitch black with a two finger high, mocca head.
Nose: Beatiful! Coffee beans, espresso, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, roasted malt, vanilla, oak, sweet caramel and fudge. 
Taste: Arabica coffe beans, espresso, bitter dark chocolate, vanilla, dark fruit, brown sugar, chocolate cake and dark syrup. 
Body: Full body with a complex structure. Light carbonation. Dry ending. 
BEATIFUL!

4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer is one of the most enjoyable imperial stout's I've ever had.  It starts out pretty typical with some nice chocolate and coffee notes on the nose.  I started drinking this beer too cold at 45 degrees and wasn't getting much flavor.  As the beer warmed though it was like an awakening of the dead.  All sorts of coffee, chocolate and hop flavors were coming out with such a smooth mouthfeel that before I knew it, it was gone.
So glad I was able to pick up this beer while travelling.  It was my first beer from DDC and it was very impressive!
Update - Had it again and it didn't live up to my first review.  Brought some of the numbers down a bit. 658 charactersELS, Oct 14, 2015

4.78/5  rDev +8.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I had this beer on tap at The Only Cafe in Toronto, ON in a small Cervoise glass of 330 ml.
Look: The beer's body is pitch black and has a two-finger mocha head. The latter recedes to a half-a-finger layer. In comparison to other stouts, this beer's head retention, despite being resilient, is a notch below in that you will see some lilliputian holes on the head after five minutes. Moreover, the beer leaves creamy marks on the glass as you drink it.
Smell: The pungent nose is reminiscent of roasted arabica and robusta beans, which are combined and used to make an espresso. Moreover, the sweetness in the background has notes of vanilla.
Taste: The front-end as well as the middle have notes of coffee mixed with brief notes of chocolate and a slightly warmed vanilla because of the high percentage of alcohol, which is brilliantly playing peekaboo. Afterwards, the beer's hops manifest themselves. The vanilla takes a back seat and we are under the impression that a dark roast fair trade coffee has been poured into our mouth.
Feel: Because of the long presence of slightly warmed vanilla notes, I loved how the alcohol played peekaboo. It can be felt in that it warms our tongue and solar plexus a little bit. Although the beer is creamy on the mouth, it goes down faster than other stouts. As others rightly pointed it out, the beer is a little bit thin.
Overall: Compared to other stouts I have tried, this beer excels the most in the department of taste and aromas. It is delicious and is one of the best Quebecker beers I have drunk. However, I was expecting a beer that has a mouthfeel situated many notches above that of a brown ale. Other than that, I would have this beer again. 1,699 charactersakdo, Oct 12, 2015
4.49/5  rDev +2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5I picked this 11.5 ounce bottle up in Boulder Colorado on a recent visit. I'm not sure of the bottle date, but the notch code on the side of the label is 8|9 and 0. Whatever the hell that means?
Look- Pours a rather thin looking but dark black leaving a wonderful mocha head. 
Smell- Espresso forward with wonderful dark roast and a hint of vanilla. 
Taste- Dark roast coffee forward with a hint of smokiness. There is a touch of bakers chocolate sweetness and vanilla in the finish. 
Feel- A bit thin for such a decadent beer. There is a tingly and carbonated feel that I usually don't get from this style of beer. 
Overall- A very delicious coffee forward beer that is definitely one of the best. My only 'real' complaint is the thin feel, otherwise a great beer. 770 charactersPrager62, Oct 11, 2015

Aromas of fresh roasted coffee, bitter and dark, with hints of smoke and char, and highlights of cocoa nibs. Very bitter and roasted throughout. Flavors are bitter roasted coffee forward, followed immediately by rich chocolate. The chocolate notes are a nice balance of bitter/dark and sweet. Subtle highlights of smoke and char. Very balanced through and through. The body is full and smooth, but with a solid dryness in the backbone. The aftertaste is a full blend of coffee, chocolate, and smoke, lingering on past the smooth, slow, layered finish. Great beer! 684 charactersGarthDanielson, Oct 02, 2015

Appearance - Poured into a tulip glass, completely black with 2 fingers creamy head. cant see anything through it even in light. 
Aroma - Some very roasted malts, coffee, more coffee, light hops, alcohol did i mention coffee. whew.
Taste - coffee on the tongue to start followed by some malt and hops, more coffee. bitter but balanced soo well!
Mouth feel - medium bodied, medium carbonation not creamy but not prickly. 
Overall - what a brew, and to think a corner store near my house sells it 15$ for a 6 pack.(not so bad for craft in canada) ill definitely get it again. cheers 765 charactersCanadianBacon, Oct 01, 2015

And so far...well, I just have one thing to ask: who melted a dark chocolate bar into my beer? This is ridiculously fudgy-smelling - and that's before I mention the black coffee notes I'm picking up. It's not a coffee bomb, it's just pure mocha goodness. This is very redolent of Founders Breakfast Stout on the aroma, and that's high praise. Tasting it, though, it's quite a bit different. The essences of coffee and chocolate open it up very well, yet it ends very roasty, charred, and smoky. The coffee here, again, is subtle (what I do pick up is gently nutty yet acidic), and it's all aided by a vaguely hoppy touch. I love how it doesn't have the slimy palate of some imperial stouts - it's soft yet dry, exactly how I like it. A touch of alcohol helps nuance the flavor nicely. I'm definitely not let down by this one, as it's rich yet easy to drink. Shame it's $6 a bottle, though it's a bargain compared to OTHER coffee stouts BEERGEEKBRUNCHWEASEL.

Pours very dark and opaque. one finger head of dark tan foam, lots of foamy cling.  Smell brings big coffee, really great aroma, chocolate, roasted malts.  Taste continues the coffee, just a terrific flavor to it, bitter chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts, little molasses.  Bitterness front to back, but not distracting at all.  Truly great flavor, here.  Smooth, creamy, taste lingers on the tongue.
Think this just became my favorite coffee stout, and there's a whole lot of really good ones.  Taste is well blended, the coffee is awesome, this is one everybody needs to try. 611 charactersstortore, Sep 06, 2015

A: Pours thick and black; the Absence of Light.  A gorgeous gingerbread head that maintains nicely with great lacing throughout.
S: Smells like Navy black coffee.  Nothing but coffee, overpowering, indomitable.  As someone who doesn't drink coffee, I was highly intimidated.
T: The coffee and toast are there, but aren't overpowering.  Chocolate and toffee notes help round out the flavor nicely.  There is a slightly bitter coffee aftertaste on the palate, but not an unpleasant one.  Alcohol is there but hardly noticeable under the barrage of coffee and toast.
M: Rich, malty and smooth, you usually have some of the frothy head adding to the carbonation of each pull.  
O: This is one of my all-time favorite stouts.  I can't say enough about it.  While the intense coffee smell is daunting to me, the flavors are incredibly well-balanced and the mouth feel is consistently inviting, making this a delicious and dangerous brew at 9.5%.  I'm enjoying it at room temp and recommend others try it that way, especially in the colder months. 1,166 charactersFBGordon, Aug 10, 2015

Smell is just about perfect for a (non-barrel-aged) coffee stout. Coffee smell is strong but also sweet and roasty. Taste also has strong coffee flavors, but a mildly sweet chocolate flavor also emerges and balances the potential bitterness of the coffee. Unlike many other coffee stouts I've had, it does not leave a bitter aftertaste. Very well done. Mouthfeel is satisfying; I only wish it were a little more viscous and chewy. Overall: it lives up to the hype. This is close to perfection for a coffee stout that has not seen the inside of a bourbon barrel. 623 charactersccg, Aug 04, 2015

4.93/5  rDev +12%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5It pours out a thick, dark black with a creamy mocha colored head that stays around for a while and leaves behind a fair amount of lacing. Strong, intense coffee aroma with slight bitter chocolate as well. The coffee flavor is magnificent, but unlike the bitter coffee aroma, it's tamed by a creamy sweetness that balances the beer to great effect, and reminds me of adding milk to coffee, which is how I take mine. 
Letting it linger on the tongue, the coffee starts out bitter, smooths out a bit, and is joined by roasted malt and a very slight chocolate flavor towards the end. The mouthfeel will stick around and probably be the example I compare other stouts to, as it fits my (unfounded) notion of what a stout should be: rich, creamy, thick, chewy. 
I'm not sure how this could be any better. This was the first morning, coffee-flavored beer I've ever had, so my opinion may be a bit weaker in terms of something to compare it to. Perhaps after I've had others, my ratings might change, but now for now, this deserves its spot near the top of my list of favorite beers. 1,078 charactersfrozyn, Aug 02, 2015

The amount of coffee used in this beer has to be immense, as the aromas yield an utmost profound coffee appearance, which wouldn't need the help of any other ingredients to compose a convincing nose. The coffee though gets perfectly balanced by scorched earth and a huge amount of peated, wooden earth. Underneath, there is a well build layer of dark-chocolate, together with a whiff of coffee, coating up the aromas perfectly well.
Has a fantastic, fuller mouthfeel, due to the beers low carbonation and earth supported creaminess, perfectly showcasing the profound coffee flavor.
Tastes of soft whipped-cream, balancing warming, oaky malts, amped up by roasted wood and charred toast. As coffee enters the palate, it instantly defines the whole taste, while the beers foundation still adds up to the taste in all its facetts. Fresh toasted, crushed toffee beans offer up a pleasant, bitter roastiness, together with flowery cocoa powered bakers chocolate. Finishes with silk milk chocolate, and a supportive coffee bitterness, which creates an intense ending, while also allowing subtle flavors of oak, toffee, fudge, coal and chimney fire to remain detectable. 
This beer is a real treat, exhibiting a challenging depth of flavors, together with a fantastic mouthfeel. Everything comes incredibly well together, resulting in a simply perfect coffee stout. 1,461 charactersaleigator, Jul 29, 2015

3.97/5  rDev -9.8%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Look; Like used motor oil, the beer is pitch black and shiny, completely opaque, no light shines through. Pours a thin ring of lacing that dissipates quickly.
Smell-Fresh brewed coffee, with hints of dark fruit and alcohol.
Taste-The taste is dominated by espresso, in the sense that the coffee taste is very fresh and powerful, but also extremely bitter. A bit of alcohol is there as well.
Feel-Almost no carbonation, Very oily and very heavy, this is a sipper.
Overall- I appreciate the fresh taste of the coffee but there beer is just slightly too bitter for me to enjoy it to the extent of of my favorite coffee stouts, but it is an excellent representative of the style and more then worth trying. 702 charactersSteveB24, Jul 19, 2015

T - very well balance coffee and chocolate.  Bitter coffee finish.
M - medium body and  low carb. 360 charactersAirBob, Jul 18, 2015

Appearance: black, yet transparent. Blood, ruby when held to light. A nice tan 1 finger head lasts and lasts - more than 15 minutes before my initial sip. 
Aroma: coffee! and then a caramel sweetness.
Flavor: coffee and oak. Is this barrel aged? A hint of smoke in the background, like the morning after you've smoked a cigar. Roast malt comes through late to dry out the beer. The best flavors arrive 15 seconds or so after you swallow. 
Mouthfeel: the body is surprisingly thin for a 9.5% abv beer. I'd expect and prefer more body. 
Overall: this was a good beer but not one I'd pursue. I'm not blown away by this beer. 635 charactersPray_For_Mojo, Jul 15, 2015

A: Midnight black with a thin mocha lacing.
S: Dark roasted coffee, sweet chocolate,  roasted malt.
T: Similar to the nose, dark candied sweetness, a nice bitter alcoholic kick mid to late sip. Alcoholic warmth hits the palate fairly early upon sipping.
M: Thin mouthfeel, somewhat syrupy, silk like with mild carbonation and medium bitterness.
O: Love it!! Need to acquire more, but fairly difficult to come by. 515 charactersMA_hops, Jul 11, 2015

4.54/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5This is my new favorite beer! Pours a deep black color with about a one finger head that dissipates to a thin filmy layer. Smell is of huge coffee with hints of chocolate. Flavor is even better - coffee, coffee, and more coffee. Not too thick and not too thin and leaves a slight bitterness in the mouth.  Overall a tremendous example of a coffee stout. Reminds me of a Founders Breakfast Stout but with more coffee flavor and less sweetness. I personally prefer this. I only wish it was more readily available. I will be on the lookout for this and buy the store out the next time I see it. 591 charactersMuFugga, Jul 05, 2015

This most excellent coffee stout pours black as sin with a moderate brown head of dissipating foam that dies down to a thick, lush ring of foam and very nice lacing.  Nose of espresso, cream, cocoa, and some smoked malt elements.  Flavors follow the nose with solid rich espresso and light cream sweetness to all sides followed by strong dark cocoa flavors to the middle and back with a lightly smokey, heavy, bitter coffee flavor on the back and aftertaste.  Smooth and slick mouth feel with a lingering aftertaste of cocoa and coffee.  Excellent.  I would suggest this as a finisher since it is SO heavy and very intense.  Coffee lovers rejoice, stout lovers prepare your praise.  This is most excellent. 774 charactersBrutaltruth, Jun 20, 2015

4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Poured from the 11.5 oz. bottle into a Victory Donnybrook Stout nonick.
a: Opaque black with slight clear ruby hoghlights at the bottom.  Finger thick tan head receded to thick even surface foam and dense lacing.
s: Black coffee and alcohol.
t: Smoky malt up front with some black coffee notes and heavy bite.  Bitterness lingers in the back of the mouth of an otherwise dry finish.
m: Very smooth medium to full, considerable carbonation tingle.
o: Obvious quality, but rather more harsh/bitter at first, and less coffee flavor than expected.  Bottled 7/13 so at nearly two years of age it may be past its prime for a coffee stout, although like many stouts it has a smoother mouthfeel with some age on it. 712 charactersscotorum, May 25, 2015

4.81/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Picked this up at La Capsule Cave à Bière in Nancy, France.  Thick pitch black pour with one finger caramel-colored head with decent retention and lacing.  Huge roasted coffee notes dominate the nose along with hints of dark chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, espresso, and booze.  The taste follows suit with earthy dark chocolate and coffee dominating along with hints of espresso, cocoa, chocolate fudge, vanilla, brown bread, and leather.  The mouthfeel is thick and chewy, maybe even slightly oily, with incredible balance and drinkability, and a velvety smooth finish.  Overall, this just became my favorite Coffee Stout!  Incredibly flavorful and unbelievably drinkable.  Highly recommended!!! 694 charactersbeerdrifter, May 23, 2015

A: Black with a tan head, some carbonation coming off the bottom, some lacing, looks a little thin for a double stout.
A: Coffee, chocolate malts, alcohol on the nose, mostly dark roasted coffee notes, smells great.
T: Roasted coffee, dark chocolate, some bitterness, finishes with a nice bitter dark chocolate flavor,really good, love all the flavors going in this beer. 
M: Medium mouthfeel, finishes dry.
O: Very impressed, my two favorite flavors in one, stout and coffee, very complex, definitely earns its world class rating, if you love coffee stouts this one is worth a try and is worthy of regular consumption. 668 charactersBrolo75, May 23, 2015

A – Pours a deep dark black, with slightly translucent mahogany edges. Head is creamy cappuccino colored and leaved behind spotty lacing.
S – Intense notes of rich and deeply roasted coffee and chocolate malt.
T – Roasty, bitter and fresh espresso roasted coffee, dark and nearly charred notes of rich malts.
M – Medium-Full, not overly heavy, long and lingering finish.
O – Truly a world class representation of the style. This leans toward the drier and more bitter side of the spectrum, which I really appreciate. Wonderful beer. 584 charactersMoose90, Apr 19, 2015

a: pitch black with a finger of coffee-coloured head. yep, coffee stouts...
s: espresso/black coffee, cocoa, caramel, licorice, slight dark fruit
t: very coffee-forward stuff -- i love it.  up front is a quick prune-like dark fruit note, but that quickly dissolves into rich freshly-roasted coffee/espresso and cocoa.  mid-to-late-palate has a mild herbal, licorice-like hop presence, notes of toasted bread and maybe a touch of toffee. finishes with bitter coffee and cocoa flavours that linger forever
m: slightly above medium body, creamy stuff, coats your mouth.  little to no carbonation

3.67/5  rDev -16.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Almost opaque dark brown color with subtle carbonation activity. Creamy light brown 1.5 finger head lasting around 5 minutes and some good legs.
Aromas and flavors of toffee, cocoa, coffee, herbal spices. Strong earthy roasted oak like bitter taste, slight caramel sweetness, and smoky cappuccino feel.
Creamy milky medium body with some perfect carbonation. Strong and long finish ending with a highly spicy burnt mouth coat and thick toffee feel aftertaste.
Overall : Warming good craft without the elegance. Overly spicy, slightly stale, missing some body, and not very accessible. Overhyped in my opinion. 612 charactersTheBierdimpfe, Apr 09, 2015

4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Appearance - The Beer poured a deep dark black. 
Smell - The nose was far from exceptional. Notes of bitter coffee were most notable. 
Taste - Bitter coffee comes through at the front. The bitterness continues and lingers. This coffee could use some creamer. Bitter continues in the aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel - The thickness allows the tongue to feel loke a mouthfull of dark coffee grounds. 
Overall - A sold stout, though one I may not repeat. 446 charactersJohnnyHopps, Apr 03, 2015

A- Opens well and pours a tiny head that films out in seconds. Super dark black color here. 
S- Oodles of chocolate, coffee and unfortunately heat. Less heat would be a higher score
T- Nice coco flavor. Fair amount of heat takes this down a touch. Coffee notes hit you at the very end. Nice blend.
M- Creamy good. Has a bit of chalkiness to it but still very good
O- Nice beer. Glad I bought a case. Will see how it goes over the years. Worth exactly what I paid for it but no more. It's 80% as good as a Tenfidy or simiilar
Food Pairing
This high heat beer went well with..... Pad Thai. The spiciness was cut by this high heat beer.

The alcohol is well hidden; while this is definitely a sipper, one could have several of these before unceremoniously falling off a bar stool. 349 characters57md, Apr 01, 2015

A gentle pour yielded a thin head that receded to a ring. Dots of lace are left behind as the beer is consumed. Aroma is of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. Taste is bitter espresso, dark cherries, some vanilla, unsweetened chocolate, and a smoky/roasty malts. On the low end of full body, creamy and thick texture, soft carbonation, and a long bitter finish. 459 charactersSierraFlight, Feb 23, 2015

Edgy, hot ground coffee.
Taste of whole coffee beans, not the smooth and mild sort. Little sugar, bubble gummy from the start but that doesn't hold. Charcoal, marshmallow and roasted malt make for a bit of astringency. Lingering coffee aftertaste.
Hardly carbonated. 314 characterspants678, Feb 06, 2015

4.83/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a bottle into pint glass.
Appearance: Very dark with nice thick brown head.
Smell: Pleasant, and can smell some hops, but the aroma is dominated by coffee and the roasted malts.
Taste: Excellent taste. There is a strong coffee influence with some sweetness from the malts and balanced with a little hops. As expected from an Imperial Stout, it has a high alcohol content.  It is a great balance that is not too bitter, nor too sweet. The balance between the flavors is great. 
This beer is very smooth with a nice aftertaste that is not too bitter. 
This is one of the best imperial stouts I've tasted. You will enjoy it if you like a bold stout with coffee flavors. It is complex, and every time I drink it, I get something new. Definitely a beer to drink again. The more I drink it, the more I like it. One of my favorites. 842 charactersJJKBeerLvr, Jan 18, 2015

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%A Canadian beer from Montreal, poured a jet black colour with a coffee crema head. 
The Initial taste was an intense espresso hit that tapered off into a dark chocolate flavour with hints of orange and tiramisu laced throughout. 
The ending was like a smooth long black poured just right. At 9.5% this imperial coffee stout is an incredible drop!

The bottle lists the ABV (9.5%) and there is a date code of some kind (It is 9.5% I am not sure if matters).
S: [3.50] Very coffee forward.  It smells like sweet coffee.  
T: [4.00] The taste follows the nose.  Very prominent coffee tones from front to back.  There is a slight bitterness to the coffee flavor.  No taste of the alcohol at all.  
M: [4.5] The mouthfeel is velvety on the tongue.  Nice carbonation level and nice slick mouthfeel.
O: [4] Where some IPAs might be a "hop bomb" this is a "coffee bomb".  I like coffee stouts - but this was almost too one dimensional.  I wish there were some hints of chocolate or roasted malts.  The mouthfeel is very good - but the nose and taste lacked depth beyond the coffee.  I thought I would be burned out by the coffee, at the end, but it actually tasted better as I reached the end.  I think this nudge it up a fraction. 996 charactersfscottkey, Nov 23, 2014

I don't get all the good ratings for this beer. Maybe i fell on a bad one?
It surely smells like coffée and dark cocoa but, nothing more.
it taste the same as an average stout should taste, (cocoa, coffee) but is waaaayyy too much bitter. Where is the sweetness everyone talks about? bitter, bitter and bitter. I feel like eating a spoonful of cheap cocoa powder added with some poorly chosen hops. No fruit here.
The feeling is very thin in mouth, a little carbonation , no density here. The texture barely gets at the end of the tongue that it is dissipated, leaving nothing but a bitterly taste and the warmth of alcohol drying my tongue out.
I feel like i must buy this beer another time from another place, because I really don't understand all the overly positive critics about this beer. And I really enjoy the other types of beer from this brewery.
I'm sorry to leave such a nasty critic, but inconsistency is a bad thing for any company out there. 1,036 charactersGmolleur, Nov 19, 2014

4.2/5  rDev -4.5%Really really dark brown, borderline black pour, small mocha head lasting just a bit, but there's a long-lasting thin lace.
Strong coffee smell with lots of caramel, dark chocolate (not the roughest kind), toffee, a deep roast, almost smokey, and a bit of raisin to set some dark fruit in there too. 
Tho the initial taste is a bit too sweet with caramel, molasses and a bit of dark fruit, the bitter coffee and roast counter is huge. Strong and rich turkish coffee, bitter and slightly acidic from start to finish with a tiny bit of sugar too, but aggressively roasted. The dark malts also help, with a light bready note, and there's a nice clear hop presence in the finish, all suming up to a really big bitterness.
Medium body, tends to get a bit oily but the carbonation won't let it. Not too fizzy either, a bit more than mildly so, especially considering the style. Aftertaste of roasted coffee bean, some dark bread crust and lingering hop bitterness.
In the end it feels a bit.. over-roasted (not totally burnt, but close to it), so there's a bit of unpleasantness stuck down the throat, but the dark chocolate at the start of every new sip helps you get past that. Excelent. 1,183 charactersdcmchew, Oct 31, 2014

4.44/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.511.5oz bottle served into a Unibroue snifter (close… at least it's French Canadian)
A: Very dark but not black - must be the deepest, darkest shade of brown; the pour shows some cola-highlighted edges, but once nestled into the glass, this bold stout is opaque; small, bubbly head, made up of about a half-finger worth of fine, khaki-colored bubbles percolates to the surface, but quickly vanishes, leaving an oily sheen on the surface; rings of lacing mark notches down the sides of the glass. 
S: More sweet than originally anticipated; of course, the intense roasted coffee aroma is most prominent - nutty, earthy, smoky, with a slightly bitter edge akin to dark/burnt roast; but there is a dark fruitiness that appears with some strength too - raisins, maybe figs too; also a touch of sugary sweetness like molasses; overall, very dense maltiness, with good roasted notes combining with some dark sweetness and a bready note - like a mug of coffee and a slice of warm raisin bread for breakfast.
T: Much like the nose, there was a nice sweet balance to the coffee-induced bitterness; in fact, the first sip starts out sweet first, with the aforementioned dark fruit and sugary molasses notes peaking first, before a steady blast of dark roasted coffee beans lends a moderating dose of bitterness; malty through the middle - brown bread, burnt toast, transitioning into a nutty flavor; more dark roasted coffee and a smoky/charred flavor peak on the finish, at first slightly astringent, but nicely smoothed out by a measure of dark chocolate that rides well through the finish. 
M: Full bodied, but not quite as heavy as other imperial stouts; carb is fine, cutting through the body in such a way that it maintains some creamy slickness, but its not overly thick nor is it chewy. 
O: Fantastic coffee stout - I would argue this pretty close to being on par with the likes of Founder's Breakfast Stout. Drinks well below its 9.5% ABV - smooth, roasty, altogether delicious. A fantastic beer for brunch (if you're into that kind of thing) or served as a nightcap. Recommended. 2,085 charactersBuschyfor3, Oct 27, 2014

5/5  rDev +13.6%Bottle into extended tulip glass. Pours jet black with one good finger of mocha fizzy (soda-like) head which dissipated pretty quickly to a ring around the glass. Thin rings, and islands of lacing.
N: A bit of sweet roasted malt, and LOTS of black coffee. A tiny touch of dark chocolate but this is certainly more on the coffee side.
T: Nice and roasty at first, and then the coffee really comes out, and some bitterness on the finish. Wait a bit before the next sip to really get the full coffee experience from this
M: Medium-Full bodied. So pleasing for a strong stout at 9.5%. I was hoping it wouldn't be too thick and it's not. Very nice mouthfeel, a bit of alcohol warmth but the booze is well masked.
I'm on the fence about this brewery, but this happens to be incredible! 783 characters2_Shaynez, Oct 25, 2014

4.69/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75On-tap @ Memphis Taproom in Philadelphia, PA.
Served in a wine glass.  Opaque, black color with a small yet persistent tan head.  Some lacing and legs when swirled around in the glass.  Aroma is overwhelmingly chocolate, coffee, and raisin.  Lots of the same in the flavor but with a touch of alcohol.  Mouthfeel is perfect.  So creamy it almost feels like a nitro draught.  Full bodied and smooth.  Incredibly drinkable for the strength.
I've had this from a bottle a couple of times but to have it on-tap was a rare treat, as it transformed into something even more special.  If you see it at a bar or at the Dieu du Ciel brewpub and are a fan of big stouts, do not hesitate to give it a try.

O:  A great stout, but expensive at $10, nearly a $1 an ounce.  At that price, you would think it would be BA.  So many other stouts, that are more reasonably priced and just as good. 468 charactersgillagorilla, Oct 19, 2014

Label is quite faded and dating is checked 7, 5.  Nose reveals Sumatran coffee, milk chocolate, and 
hints of light caramel.  Perfectly balanced, these scents become flavors in your mouth that waltz across 
the roof of your mouth.  The finish doesn't bitter, just more smooth unburned coffee.  You'd be
hard pressed to find a better coffee double stout.  FBS, which I love, is in the backseat here.... 508 charactersbeerdedking, Sep 20, 2014

4.45/5  rDev +1.1%Finally reviewing this brew. She pours a nice shade of black with a light mocha head. Looks phenomenal. Let's whiff this beaut. Huge hits of coffee even the acidity of coffee. Nice sweet cocoa/espresso dense roasted malts. Smells intense. Taste test time! This thing is coffee/espresso and roasted malts with just a touch of residual sugars to keep it going. There is also a hint of acidity and bitterness but non offensive. Also hints of chocolate cookie crumble. The feel of the brew is full bodied and yet not sticky. Carbonation is on point and helps the Malts/Coffee to pop on the palate. 
Overall: This brew is worth the hype. It's balanced and a touch on the complex side. If you like Imperial Stouts and Coffee Stouts this brew is for you! Hands down one of the top tier Imperial Coffee Stouts on the market. This brew is Recommended! 844 charactersShroud0fdoom, Sep 01, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +8%Pours a midnight black with a beautiful two finger mocha head. It smells like freshly brewed espresso, bakers chocolate, and darkly roasted grains. There is also a very big freshly ground espresso bean note, like the smell when you open up your coffee grinder and that dusty, intense coffee aroma flows in to your nostrils. The taste follows the nose, with intense, oily black espresso at the front. There is a light amount of sweetness to make sure the bitter coffee doesn't overwhelm. The beer is nicely carbonated and body is not quite full... The mouth feel is perfect for the delivery of the flavors. The astringency is spot on. This is a world class beer; try as hard as you can to get a taste. It's by far the best imperial coffee stout I've tasted. 756 charactersJack_Malts, Aug 31, 2014

 The aroma has the smell of smooth, black coffee, chocolate, and deep roasted malt.
 The coffee smell in the aroma is the same in the taste, but more prominent. Almost expresso, like smoothness with more of a straight black flavor. Very nice. Not as in your face like a Founders Breakfast Stout. Also tastes like the filling of a chocolate cream pie that is more bitter as it lingers along with some ashyness. Has some faint tobacco and leather in there too.
 It is very creamy smooth. A little surprising for the style. Drank almost like a cream stout. Body was very full.  It was a lot like Ten Fidy for me in regard to temperature. I didn't care for it as much as it warmed to room temp.
 I think the sweet spot is in the 50-60 range. Excellent, must try beer. $6 is what I paid for the single. 859 charactersWesMantooth, Aug 24, 2014

This is a stout with many of my favorite qualities of an IPA. It was quite bitter, but had a lot of flavor to back up the bitterness. And that flavor was complex, with prominent coffee as well as a smoky taste. This is an excellent beer, and brewery, that you should seek out if you have the chance. 367 charactersrjcohen, Aug 08, 2014

Appeared a dark brown nearly black color with a brown two finger head.
Smelled of coffee, expresso and dark chocolate.
Taste was coffee dominant, though had a slightly unpleasant butterscotch tang to it.
Mouthfeel was medium bodied and nice.
Overall a solid beer but I prefer FBS/FIS/BGBW 355 charactersTWStandley, Aug 07, 2014

Notes from 06/26/2014
A: Dark, thick, and ominous looking. Some dark coffee brown at the pour but all black coffee in the glass. Nice compacted finger width of mocha head forms over for more than a few minutes here. Light dotting and streaks of lace left clinging to the glass.
S: Smells intensely rich with some dark chocolate and spent coffee grains. Has a touch of sour tobacco there and a light soy Umami thing going on but I like it. Loads of dark roast grains in this one with some dark plum like fruity esters and a hint of smoky char on the trailer. 
T: Tastes like chocolate silk cake with espresso. The beer brings tons of roasty dark grain character with some pronounced black strap molasses and dark fruits. Has a good amount of dark caramel sweetness without becoming a dessert beer. I get some light ABV heat coming through in the finish and a whisper of smoke to it. Mix in a touch of earty hop bitterness to cut down some of that richness. A really great combination of all the elements and not just a coffee overload. Big brew for such a tiny little bottle. 
M: Thick and full bodied with a great silky smoothness. Carb is fine for the style and lends a nice frothiness to the feel. Finishes with a fair amount of alcohol warming and a sleek feel that really coats the palate.
D: A sipper brew for sure with its thicky thickness and intense dark roast rich with mocha flavors. The coffee does seem a bit stale at times but it is a nuanced addition to the beer and not center stage which is appreciated. Not really sure why I don’t pick this one up more often. Well worth seeking out. Would love to try the BA version. 1,687 charactersNugganooch, Aug 06, 2014

Heavy, rich espresso aroma.  Some bitter chocolate and roasted(almost burnt) malt.
Taste follows the aroma.  Dominant bitter espresso.  Rich bitter chocolate and roasted malt.  Mild sweet cream, vanilla, and brown sugar at the end.
Heavy mouth feel with an almost acrid feel on the tongue.  Oily and lingering on the tongue.  A creaminess which belies some of the bitterness of the coffee and chocolate flavors.  Just a touch of alcohol.
This is a huge, intense coffee experience.  A perfectly executed beer which is a coffee lovers dream. 631 charactersleroybrown10, Jul 30, 2014

4.46/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.512 oz. bottle undated but kept in cellar since 2008 (Live review July 15, 2014). Pours into Stone IRS tulip. Dark ruby body pushing on black. Finger of creamy khaki head which falls after about 2-3 minutes. Sticky thick strings of lacing surround the glass as the head drops to a thin crown. 
There was a little surface rust beginning to develop on the cap which made me incredibly nervous, but there is thankfully no sign of oxidation in the nose. Coffee is definitely the dominant aroma. Freshly ground French, even Italian roasted coffee beans with hints of primarily dark, but also milk chocolate. Roasted malts, nutty, and a touch of raisiny esters.
The coffee is a bit more mellow in the flavor compared to the nose, but it is still dominant. Overall, this reminds me of chocolate-covered espresso beans; dark, bitter chocolate takes hold just as much as the coffee. Sweet lactose sugar and anise. No sign of the 9.5% ABV. Very roasty. Dry toasted and bitter chocolate finish.
Full-bodied, but not as thick as could be expected. Moderate carbonation and very chewy. Slight warmth from the alcohol.
Overall, this beer is wonderful. Even with this six year old bottle, the coffee smells like it was just ground this morning. This is an amazing beer fresh and after over half a decade. Unless you absolutely cannot stand coffee, this is a must try. 1,355 charactersPhocion, Jul 15, 2014

This is foremost a coffee beer and secondarily it is an imperial stout. This flavor is truly amazing. The mouth is thick and chewy. 367 charactersFranziskaner, Jul 07, 2014

4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25A: Oily pitch black body, even when held up to the light. A one finger khaki head on the initial pour that recedes to a thin film and a ring around the edges of the glass. Beautiful stout.
S: Roasty and rich espresso and raw cacao upfront. A hint of sweet toffee and malt character take up the rear. A bit of alcohol heat emerges as it warms, and in coherence with the rest of the aromas is vaguely reminiscent of amaretto. Could smell this all day.
T: Bitter and astringent espresso and unsweetened cacao again are detected first, although not as potent as the nose. Roasty and acrid malt, as well as notes of tobacco follow and linger in the aftertaste. Definitely a showcase of the roastier side of stouts, little to no dark fruit or sweetness to speak of. Still great, but not as impressive as the aromas led me to expect. No trace of alcohol.
M: Full bodied and lightly carbonated, with an astringent and drying finish that lingers forever and is complementary to the lack of sweetness. 
O: Great expression of an imperial coffee stout. The drying finish and lack of sweetness really accentuate the roasted notes of the malt and the bitter espresso character. I prefer a bit more balance in my imperial stouts in regards to residual sugar and a bit more sweetness, which makes me think that I would LOVE the bourbon barrel version. Still a fantastic beer, and I'll definitely grab it again whenever I see it. 1,417 charactersMore_betterness, Jun 28, 2014

Smells like rich, bitter chocolate and espresso. Tastes much the same -- smooth, but boozy in a luxurious sort of way. Like amaretto. There are also some dark fruit flavors hiding deep within. Plenty of bitter black licorice and a little vanilla. There's an astringency that, coupled with the booziness, is a bit off-putting. 
Overall, this beer delivers some of the best coffee and chocolate flavors that I've had in a stout. The coffee even brings a bit of cherry to the table. But the whole experience seems a bit thin and boozy, and at times bitter and astringent. There's a strange abrasiveness around the edges, especially when juxtaposed with the utterly smooth and luxurious flavors that are found elsewhere in this beer. Hmm, I'm conflicted but I find myself getting past the boozy bitterness and really enjoying the dark fruit/cherry center. 942 charactersMongrel, Jun 25, 2014

Smells like sticky, sweet coffee syrup and smokey malt goodness. It's freakin' awesome.
Sweet, savory, and plentiful layers of dark malt have notes of coffee, caramel, and a little chocolate. Sweetness up front and lingering coffee flavour at the end. The taste is quite bitter throughout, although the coffee flavour comes out phenomenally.
The mouthfeel is thinner than most imperial stouts, but the bold flavours compensate generously.
Overall a fantastic Imperial (Coffee) Stout with a pretty good price. Only downside is that some people may find this too bitter. 629 charactersIan_B, Jun 17, 2014

T- Comes off very smooth coffee stout. Just the right amount of coffee, chocolate then come cream. I just ate a street taco with tons of onions so I may be off here. 
M- So very creamy, the amount of carb makes this very smooth. Almost perfect on the M. Very smooth stout that is up there with the top tier smooth stouts.

9.5% abv
A: Gorgeous jet black beer pours nicely into the glass with an almost non-existent light tan/khaki 1mm head. Very light but lasting lacing left after a few swirls in the glass.
S: So much chocolate and coffee come together nicely. Nothing overly sweet or syrupy in the smell, just pure malty and coffee goodness. Coffee is the most prevalent but the chocolate is there in the background.
T: Well that was quite a big sip. Gaah, I love this beer so much. I pick one up every few weeks and really can't get past how good this is for the price. Nice bitter coffee up front packing quite a punch but nothing over the top. There's such a great balance in this beer between the up front, in your face coffee character that is kept in check by a very smooth and palatable bitter chocolate. There's a whisper of sweetness on the finish and the almost 10% abv is hidden very well, although it is far from feeling light.
M: Silky smooth goodness! Nothing too viscous here but definitely thick, creamy and pleasant. Could definitely be improved upon by a little carbonation. 
O: I love this beer. I pick one of these up quite often because it's an outstanding beer at a very reasonable price. It's actually quite hard to beat such high quality at this price point. The beer looks and feels great but falls short due to low carbonation. The smell and taste are just superb giving a very balanced coffee/chocolate bitterness. I would love to see how this beer improves with a nice long slumber in a bourbon barrel and perhaps a bit more carbonation, because that may be close to fives across the board. I will definitely be drinking many more of these in my day and am very pleased with how easy it is to acquire/what it doesn't do to my wallet. 1,798 charactersThreeLions, Jun 13, 2014

Soonafter, the head faded away into a thin film, concentrating around the glass like a halo. When held directly in front of the bright sun, no light penetrated this dense, super dark stout. The smell of roasted malts, dark chocolate, and mocha was enticing. I waited until the temperature hit approximately 54 F, then took my first sip. The taste was dominated by coffee rich mocha, light bitterness, and some background booze. This is balanced and smooth with low carbonation.

Location: Hicksville Beverage
Glassware: Tulip
Appearance: Brown to light brown by the edging. Caramel carbonation pours with a slight head. As the beer is consumed rings if viscous carbonated bubbles are left. The beer absorbs a good deal of light. 
Aroma: Big aroma of coffee on the nose. The coffee is slightly burnt with sweet smells of baking sugar. The malts add a slight earthy flavor with a touch of sweetness from them as well. I get a slight scent of salt as well. 
Taste: The coffee plays as big a role in the flavor as it did the aroma. What comes through a little bit more is some toffee and toasted grinds. Because of the coffee grinds the beer has a somewhat earthy taste to it. 
Mouthfeel: Medium to Heavy in body. Moderate to High carbonation. The beer has a bit of chew to it as you put down the coffee flavors. 844 charactersKornWallace, Jun 05, 2014

S: Rich roasted malt of burnt and chocolatey aromas matches a robust coffee aroma and they play off each other very well. There are hints of char and tobacco with a bit of booze in the background but not overly stated. 
T: For the first big flavor dose, layers of roasted barley from charred to bitter chocolate and rich molasses. Then flavor dose number two is the rich espresso-like coffee with a hint of cream. After this there are unfolding layers of sweet and bitter and even a touch smokey. Among these are esters of plums and raisins, ashy notes, bitter dark chocolate, and a touch of tobacco.
M: This liquid is full bodied and almost chewy. The carbonation is moderate to thin with a velvety smoothness. A warming from the alcohol is noticeable but in check and very welcoming.
O: For those beer lovers who also love coffee, this is a must try! Up there with the best coffee stouts I have ever tried. I am very into how in check the alcohol is with all that this beer has going on. It does not overwhelm you with boozy flavors it just seduces you in to the rich deep body and flavor and gives you a warm embrace. It is best at cellar temperature and could do well aging I am sure.

Aroma is wonderful. Obviously lots of gourmet coffee that bring notes of bold roast and earthy green pepper. Also get bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, carmel sweetness, and some vanilla.
Taste is blanketed with dark, bold, roasted coffee. This is balanced nicely with carmel first, then vanilla sweetness into the finish. Get some milk/bittersweet chocolate and some roasted malt in the middle of the mouth and into the finish to go with the coffee and sweetness. No alcohol to taste, but definitely provides some warming as it goes down.
High medium body with a sticky and oily mouthfeel. Nicely carbonated and creamy.
The balance and complexity on this coffee stout is superb and is the reason why I consider this one of the best coffee stouts out there. The way the coffee plays with the roasty and chocolatey base beer and is all tempered with that carmel and vanilla sweetness is excellent. 977 charactersbrewskis, May 26, 2014

The beer is an absolute black with a three-finger mocha cloud head that is quite slow to recede.
An aroma of deep, rich coffee and chocolate dominates. Some raisins and vanilla may be underneath. A smoky, leathury scent is there as well... and maybe some maple. 
Start to finish, the flavor is full of dark, rich chocolate and coffee. Somewhat bitter and significantly earthy. Some astringent molasses is also in there.
The feel is big, thick, and... imperial.
Being a coffee connoisseur will heighten enjoyment of this brew. 593 charactersKuaff, May 25, 2014

4.44/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the bottle into a pub glass at Kawa espresso bar here in Calgary. Basically pitch black, opaque with no trace of light refraction or other sources of color other than the light brown sponge-toffee like head. Aroma is surprisingly vinous and fruity, with some caramel, dates and red wine along with the more-expected burnt coffee and singed grain elements. This beer is extremely well-regarded and I now understand the hype. There is none of the overpoweringly burnt flavor reminiscient of a dry ashtray that one can get with less well-crafted coffee stouts. The coffee flavor is bold and rich but balanced by caramel, milk chocolate, pecan, almond nougat, and red wine notes, and the coffee itself comes across like a smooth cappucino as opposed to gnarly, abrasive instant crystals. Features a moderately syrupy body, a silky smooth mouthfeel adds to the cappucino effect, and the carbonation is decidedly low-key. Finishes dry and spicy, with a little faint ash that does not detract and some black pepper. The fruity sweetness continues to linger for some time as well. The coffee features prominently but is checked just enough by fruit, nut, and caramel notes to avoid any nastiness. Wonderful beer and the best coffee stout I've yet to sample. 1,261 charactersCalgaryFMC, May 12, 2014

4.21/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25A- Pitch black with a thin khaki head. SheeTs of runny lacing. Just by looking at it, i can tell that I am going to like this one.
S- smokey, espresso, milk chocolate. There is a subtle note of burnt bread. I mean that in the beat way possible. A bit of warmth brings out dark fruits and a healthy dose of alcohol.
T- wow. Espresso. The bitterness is pronounced, but justified by all of the burnt and roasted flavors of this beer. There is a decent alcohol kick in the finish, actually, more than decent.
M- big, rich, subdued carbonation. 
O- this beer is huge, and I love it. A bit too much alcohol on the palate though. 626 characterssilverking, May 12, 2014

In a wine glass this has a creamy espresso head, smooth and satisfying with great retention. Aroma of dark coffee with a strong roasty character. Taste was similar with a strong stout presence augmented with a delicious espresso character, smooth mouthfeel, coating with a nice clean bitterness at the end. Balanced and complex, highly recommended.
Had on nitro tap at the brewery on recommendation, silky smooth head, delicious with a even smooth carbonation. Taste is more towards delicious espresso, dark chocolate, dark cherries, towards the end there is building roasty bitterness, very tasty. The mouthfeel on nitro is sublimely smooth and prompted me to up my rating. 780 charactersmick303, May 11, 2014

4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Picked up a 32 oz growler.
Has a silky smooth feel to it. Not much in the way of carbonation. Not a very powerful smell either. Maybe a little cocoa/chocolate. The taste starts off with an almost licorice flavor that quickly goes into a heavy coffee that lingers. A lot of coffee, but not overpowering, along with a thick chocolate flavor. 
I got a little of a banana/clove flavor in there, but haven't seen that in many of the other reviews. I'm assuming it's just me perceiving something from the yeast?
A nice coffee stout that I'd be happy to drink again. 561 charactersJandJMD, May 10, 2014

A- Black beauty with a fat taupe-brown colored head. Spider-web lacing sticks like glue to the inside of the glass. There's evidence of bottle conditioning in the form of sediment at the bottom of the glass. Of course, the liquid is so dense that I had to lift the glass and look from below to view the sinkers. 
S- Wonderful. Coffee, dark chocolate, dark roasted malt. And just the right touch of warming alcohol. Some nutty aroma, too.
T- There's coffee, clearly. For me, the big winning taste is of Belgian dark chocolate. Right on.
Roasted malts back it up.
M- Full and smooth and velvety. Slightly boozy without the burn. Some bitterness with a lasting finish, touch of sweets, alcohol, then dry.
O- Crazy good. I've had this one for a while. If I bought it yesterday it may have rated 5s. 830 charactersNiceTaps, May 04, 2014

A: Pours a very dark brown appearing pitch black in the glass. A mild khaki tan head sits on top, dissipating in a couple minutes. 
S: Initially there is a nice dose of coffee that blends very well with a roasted malt quality. Dark fruit qualities come out more as it warms along with a touch of smokiness. 
T: A beer with flavor that builds on you. At first I get a slightly bitter coffee, then a blend of dark fruit comes through. The aftertaste lingers with a great roastiness for a solid 2 minutes after each sip. 
M: Very smooth beer. Creamy mouthfeel that slides like velvet over your tongue. Doesn't even seem like an alcoholic beverage. Remarkable. 
Overall I am stunned with the complexity yet harmony of this beer. Coffee is just enough to add without overwhelming, hops compliment the coffee and the roastiness just works period. 937 charactersCloudStrife, Apr 15, 2014

A: jet black with a dense, creamy, tan cap of foam... fantastic retention - let the beer sit for a good 10 min before sipping and the head barely receded... somewhat surprising, damn-near perfect, contiguous lace covering from top-to-bottom.... wow!
S: huge, rich, milky, dark chocolate scent - not much more.... little-to-no booze, perhaps some mild floral highlights.... no roasty notes of note.... hmmm....
T: coffee-creme and espresso-roasty quickly emerging up front, nearly as quickly followed by a vaguely-spicy, perhaps anise-like, flowery booze, but extremely soft with a delicate warmth*... the yeast character, phenolics seem purely Belgian... not necessarily sweet, but the coffee/ milk chocolate flavors sort of fool you.... lingering patent-like roast and bitterness in the aftertaste
M: *this delicate warmth was felt, quite glowingly, in my belly... amazing how soft this... mild grainy-silky texture, but not quite viscous - similar to that of adding lactose?... i can't describe how ridiculously fast I downed this once I started sipping - 4-5 sips at most, to finish
O: wow! loved this... I held out a long time - having first heard of this beer maybe almost 6-7 years ago - before finally trying this for the first time... I feel like it has the fermentation profile, velvety smoothness, and subtle sweetness of some American-made, Belgian-style stouts I've tried, but the coffee and roast flavors seem genuinely American.... whatever, doesn't matter, why label? - this is a kick-ass creation! 1,603 charactersBouleboubier, Apr 01, 2014

I couldn't find a year, only a month and day for when the beer was brewed. Oh well.
I'm surprised that there's not much of a head on this beer. It's only about a quarter-finger thick and quickly dissipates. Lacing is also scarce. The beer is otherwise pitch-black with some mild carbonation visible. 
As the label suggests, I get a dark roasted coffee aroma with my first whiff. It's not as overpowering as I'd expect. There's also some sweetness and chocolate present. Maybe some vanilla. It's a good aroma, but still fairly subdued. 
I'm really impressed with the coffee flavor here. It's dark and roasty, but really moderate and not overbearing. It's an excellent coffee that went into this. But it's not just coffee I'm drinking. There's plenty of tasteful sweetness in here and a creamy, almost lactose-like component making this closer to coffee with milk. I'd say it's like a vanilla hazelnut latte or something along those lines. A tasty coffee treat.
Plus, this drinks really mellow-like. There's no alcohol heat. Nothing to heavy or unpleasant. It's smooth, has a slight carbonation, and a creamy feel. There's a burnt character that lingers on the finish, maybe even providing some oak or wood character, but even this is nice and mellow. 
I'm a fan of this beer. The appearance didn't blow me away and the smell was good, but not great, but the taste and mouthfeel are next level. A true joy to drink. 1,444 charactersONovoMexicano, Mar 30, 2014

The color is totally opaque coffee-brown with a 3 f head.
Aroma: deep roasted coffee and some cocoa. This is not faux coffee- it's the real deal:the beer is infused with fair trade coffee. The aroma isn't my favorite, but it's well done.
Mouth feel- quite pleasant and not over-carbonated.
Taste: deep roasted coffee, cocoa, some lemon. Quite intense.
Finish: smooth coffee. Unlike the intensity in the aroma and taste, the beer finishes smoothly - a nice contrast to the latter.
Overall. An excellent imperial stout. I am not partial to the deep roasted aroma- taste in beer, but this imperial stout is well done. It's best at 50F. 660 charactersbrureview, Mar 27, 2014

Initially, a 1-inch thick tan foamy head, which dissipated somewhat abruptly, yet leaving a collar with innumerable tiny bubbles and fine, sticky, beige lacing throughout the experience. The coffee scent jumped from the bottle and was noticeable even from a distance within moments after hitting the glass. Upon further inspection, roasted chocolate with notes of licorice and cinnamon spice were apparent, all of which were replicated on the palate at first sip. A little more carbonation than expected (based on the nose), while subtle hints of vanilla & coconut emerged. A little more sweetness and a little less bitter carbonation (a la BCBS and KBS) would make this stout truly special. Still, a very fine example of the style. 799 charactersJohnParadee, Mar 18, 2014

A: Black pour with a tall, frothy medium brown head. Head fades very slowly with great head retention. Heavy thick fluffy lacing everywhere. 
S: Can smell the coffee from across the room immediately. Big, sharp, acrid coffee bean aroma. A little creamy chocolate sweetens it up decently.
T: What do you know, more coffee bean. Big bitter coffee flavors up front. This is definitely fresh. Lots of creamy chocolate joins the coffee shortly, sweetening it up and lending a really nice mocha flavor. Sweetness runs out in the finish, leaving a semisweet chocolate and bitter coffee flavor lingering forever in the aftertaste. Get almost a little hoppy bitterness lingering in the aftertaste too, sort of a resinous piney flavor but just a little bit.
M: Medium-heavy, smooth and creamy.
O: A really nice coffee stout. Huge and tasty coffee flavors abound. Not TOO bitter due to the inclusion of a nice sweet chocolate. Ends up balanced decently but there is still plenty of bitterness to go around at the same time. Helps keep it from being cloying I think. Very tasty. Half a notch down from FBS, IMO. Must drink this one fresh for sure. Don't age it, trust me.

REVIEW 09-13-2013
Unsure of age but fairly aged. Looks like the 2 and the 0 are ticked off on the side of the label. Unsure what that means, Feb 2010? It would be about right I guess.
A: Pours black with a medium sized brown head. Head is very dense and refuses to go anywhere. Frothy too, like a chocolate milkshake. Great retention. Moderate splotchy lacing. (4.25)
S: Roasted coffee bean and umami. Hints of chocolate. (3.75)
T: Roasted coffee bean up front, rich but mellow. Not sharp like you'd usually expect. Chocolate in the middle. Some telltale oxidation on the back end with some dusty cardboard mixing with the chocolate and leaving a dry finish. Not overpowering but definitely has surpassed its prime. A touch of bitter coffee floats between sips. (4.00)
M: Medium-heavy, smooth. (4.00)
O: Not a bad coffee stout but I noticed it has a twist-off cap. Combined with a few years of age and I think oxidation has detracted quite a bit. It's tasty and smooth but clearly not as good as it could be. I will have to check in and see if I have some newer bottles to compare with. (4.00)

The flavor is a dark roasted coffee, sweet milk chocolate makes it tastes like a latte.. Hints of vanilla and oak are present but that dark roasted malt bill is unbelievably tasty. Medium to full body with low to medium carbonation. 
This is a fantastic beer and I'll be pick up some more when I see some! Been wanting to try it for a while and finally found it in NYC - glad It was as good (actually better) as I expected. 578 charactersfacundoCNB, Mar 12, 2014

4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Enjoyed out of a brown 11.2 oz bottle with no dating of any kind; only a couple of notches on the label corresponding to two 0-9 numerals that I'm told indicate the batch number on bottles released in the U.S. For the sake of science, my two numbers are 6 and 4. Poured into a large 22 oz snifter glass.
Appearance - Decently aggressive pour yields only a small bit, maybe a half finger, of fallow colored head. That head quickly fades to a wispy film and a thin line of bubbles around the edge of the glass, which also fades away completely after too long. The body is a deep, dark brown that only reveals hints of dark chestnut with yellowish undertones when held directly in front of a bright light source. Lacing is almost nonexistent and consists mainly of sparse spots where the liquid was before those too disappear.
Smell - Strangely, I don't get much coffee from the nose of this beer at all. And given the use of cryptic batch numbers instead of dating, I'm left to wonder if I have an old bottle. That being said, the smell is very good--if it wasn't specifically billed as an imperial stout with coffee, I'd have no issues with it whatsoever. Notes of dark roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate are the frontrunners, but they are complimented by a slight hint of dark fruits like black plum and raisin. However, those fruity elements are gone as quickly as they came, leaving only the roastiness.
Taste - Finally, I arrive at the characteristics that impart the name to this particular beer. Though the smell was missing the coffee bean element, the taste has no such problem. After an initial bit of cocoa sweetness, the robust and bitter coffee characteristics take over quite aggressively. However, there is a depth that is easy to overpower with one-note coffee flavor on many imperial coffee stouts. The same dark fruit profiles contribute a softer, slightly sweeter take on the normally harsh and dominating roasted beans. It lends a rum-like quality to the beer that I really enjoy. There is a lingering bitterness afterwards that serves as a constant reminder of the base nature of this brew.
Mouthfeel - Medium-to-heavy body with moderate-to-low carbonation. Lingering bitterness on the aftertaste and a partially sweet finish.
Overall, a very good take on the coffee imperial stout style. As far as I'm concerned, the taste is the star of the show, but beer is for drinking, after all. If you are going to get one component of your beer right, might as well make it the taste. I will probably continue to pick bottle of this here or there as I run across them, as it's really quite good. 2,615 charactersLambicPentameter, Mar 06, 2014

M: Fairly chewy, but not overly slick. Heavy mouthfeel and subdued carbonation are apropos for the style. 
O: Very, very good. Huge coffee bitternes, which I love. Will definitely pick this up again. Needs a bourbon barrel. 494 charactersMcStagger, Mar 06, 2014

pours a jet-black with a dense soapy brown head that lingers well. lacing left on glass and a thin layer left after settling. 
smells of coffee, dark chocolate, and some sweet roasted malts.
tastes of chocolate, slight espresso, coffee, big roasty malts and a slight sweet milk chocolate. very thick and creamy mouthfeel.
overall, a great stout! perhaps my favorite behind AleSmith Speedway stout. exceptional representation of the style and dangerously easy to drink. highly recommended. 539 characterszhivago373, Feb 09, 2014

S- Dark roasted notes, coffee, licorice, and some herbal hop character. A little bit of dirt aroma as well. 
T- A big step up imo. The coffee profile takes your taste buds hostage, but then they are set free with a welcoming chocolate and cream character. Just a touch of vanilla. A hop kick in the finish. Lingering hop and roasted bitterness sticks with you until the next sip. Complex and rich.
M- full body, silky, creamy, not much booze distraction. Begs for another sip.
O- While I was less than impressed with the nose on this one, the depth of the flavor really took this from a "meh" beer to one that I would purchase again. Would go great with coffee cake.

4.49/5  rDev +2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.511.2 oz bottle with twist off cap. I'm thinking this may be a bottle of the 2011 vintage. Notches on numbers 3 and 2. Poured into a Blind Tiger Brewery snifter after letting it warm up a bit. I’m really looking forward to trying this as it’s a long time want. 
Appearance: Poured down the middle the produced a finger of dark, tight khaki head. Little webs of lacing stuck to the sides for a while and a nice thick cap stuck around. Thanks bottle conditioning! Body is inky black. 
Smell: Right away you get a dry, spicy roasted coffee scent. Nutty and sweet; brings to mind hazelnuts, caramel, milk chocolate and cream. What an awesome nose, like some kind of coffee dusted chocolate. 
Taste: First, more of that spicy roasted coffee. Like smelling some freshly used grounds. The coffee is surprisingly rich and deep despite this beer being several years old. Also, lots of cream and milk chocolate with some sweet stone fruit. Finishes with a cinnamon like coffee note. Reminds me quite a bit of Mikkeller’s Beer Geek Brunch Weasel.
Mouthfeel: Full mouthfeel with low carbonation. Basically smooth and creamy. Slightly drying with a bit of heat. 
Overall: An amazing coffee stout. I had my suspicions since this had a twist off cap and was aged but the coffee is strong, smooth and rich in both the nose and taste. Rounded off with an awesome mouthfeel and good head retention for a beer of this style. Highly recommended for fans of coffee stouts. Would love to try this fresh or once it’s been aged in a barrel. 1,538 charactersCowsandBeer, Jan 21, 2014

Pours black with a decent amount of foamy tan head.
Smell is toasted malt, coffee, and slight alcohol.
Taste is very coffee forward, with toasted malt, vanilla, a slight bitterness, and much more coffee. No alcohol perceived whatsoever. Very tasty for sure, loving the coffee!
Mouthfeel is super creamy. Medium bodied with incredible smoothness. Excellent.
Overall, this is among the best coffee stouts I've had. The flavor is outstanding and it couldn't be smoother going down. If you see this, don't pass it up! 549 charactersd5001986, Jan 11, 2014

4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours a dark brown, almost perfect black, with a hint of garnet. Thick solid dark mocha head (~2 fingers) with fantastic retention and thick, thick lacing.
Initial and obvious aroma of red grape booziness, wheat/barley, cream, chocolate malt, and smooth coffee.
Interesting mix of flavors: powdery cocoa, smooth creamy coffee, and a not insignificant bit of dark fruit booziness. Mostly follows the nose, but in different proportions. Lots of wheat, and a pleasant finishing bitterness.
Not particularly thick - about medium to medium-full - but certainly full-flavored. It may not be a particularly chewy beer, but it's definitely a sipper, with significantly cloying residue.
This is an excellent, smooth, creamy, and tasty coffee stout. The coffee is smoother, if not exactly more subtle, than in beers like FBS. This could easily work as a breakfast or dessert stout, as the coffee works for the former, and the sweetness for the latter. 945 charactersRoguer, Jan 04, 2014
4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Picked up a single at Total Wine back in mid-August for $6.99. Bottled in June 2013.
Beer poured black with a nice tan head that is leaving a bit of lacing behind.
Nose is intense with espresso, mocha, roasted barley.
Taste is espresso forward, some vanilla and cocoa, roasted malts. Hopping and roastiness keep the sweetness at bay.
Mouthfeel is lighter than expected - medium bodied but very smooth.
Overall this is a world class brew, espresso is awesome, lots of flavor layers going on and a delightful feel to it. Worth every penny - treat yourself to this if you can find it. 586 charactersarizcards, Jan 04, 2014

Same soapy, dark khaki head. Dark cola, motor oil body. 
Smells like wet coffee grinds and roasted malt. I'm picking up a spicy note, but I can't quite place it.
Very smooth mouthfeel that hides the alcohol very well. Coffee is present throughout along with that hint of peppery spice.
Overall, very good beer. Coffee is upfront and the beer is smooth. I am glad I was able to try a fresh bottle. 555 charactersbcerv-ca, Dec 31, 2013

A- Pours a deep brown, nearly black body with a 1.5" dark head that reduces fairly quickly to a ring of foam. 
S- Very inviting on the nose.. big freshly brewed coffee notes, coffee beans, some chocolate, but mostly heavy coffee. 
T- Follows the nose with a big initial coffee kick, freshly ground coffee, roasty malt, chocolate, charred toastyness, heavily roasted coffee beans on the finish, some smoke. 
M- Medium-heavy body with minimal carbonation. Rich and smooth.

A-Nice midnight black pour with a mud colored head that quickly dissipates into a little lacing on the circumference. 
S-Holy coffee. Holy dark chocolate. Holy smoked malts. 
T-A dominating coffee profile that is mixed well in with the chocolate. Probably one of the more coffee forward beers I've ever had. Slight hints of tobacco. You get a bit of a lactose taste reminiscent of espresso with a splash of milk and sugar. 
M-Extremely light in carbonation. Very easy to drink and forget about the ABV. Doesn't leave your stomach feeling too thick.
O-Very very good. 616 characterskylelenk, Dec 17, 2013

The beer pours a coffee brown creamy head that quickly dissipates. The head is not very large but rises enough to be about one finger. The beer itself is a nice dark chocolate black-brown with some nice sheen on the surface and a slick appearance.
Smell:
The beer smell has a a tiny hint of alcohol but it is quickly overtaken by the other smells. The other smells consistent primarily of coffee, roasted malts, and dark chocolate. The primary notes mix well with each other and the alcohol complements the smells well. Some other smells as hints of hazelnut and a bit of a tarty dark fruit also make an appearance.
Taste:
The beer taste is dominated by strong coffee notes with hints of dark chocolate in the midtaste. Additionally, the beer has a slight mineral taste as well but works for the beer. The coffee taste dominates the palate and leaves a nice aftertaste. Slight hints of dark fruit and hazelnut that are barely noticeable. The alcohol also makes an appearance towards the end of the drink and lingers a little bit in the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel:
The beer is full bodied with very little carbonation. The feel is very smooth and slick such that it almost feels creamy or as if I'm drinking a thick milk hot chocolate.
Overall:
An impeccable beer and absolutely wonderful for when it's cold or looking for something to relax you. I only wish this was at least a seasonal beer instead of a rotating one. 1,429 charactersHattedClassic, Dec 13, 2013

4.72/5  rDev +7.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.752013 vintage, poured into a snifter
A- pours pitch black with a small fizzy dark tan head that reduces quickly leaving nothing behind, it looks like a glass of coffee 
S- huge roasted black coffee aroma up front, reminiscent of fresh espresso. Some underlying aromas of hazelnut, dark chocolate bar, charcoal/smoke, toffee, dark cherry juice, leather and cocoa. Nothing stands out, it just meshes nearly perfectly together 
T- big explosion of espresso beans on the palate with some earthy/herbal flavors, there is an amazing pure chocolate sweetness that kicks in mid-palate, literally tastes like melted dark chocolate. This transitions into some dark fruity notes with some smoky charred wood, a long linger of bitter chocolate and Sumatra coffee
M- medium body with low carbonation, slightly foamy mouthfeel with a smooth warming finish, ABV is hidden quite well considering its potency 
O- one of the best coffee stouts I've ever had, the coffee and chocolate lingers on the palate long after the finish. The meshing of coffee and chocolate is up there with FBS and I find myself continually sniffing the glass. This is an amazing beer. 1,146 charactersTreyliff, Dec 11, 2013

Small pour of midnight black...small dark brown head....fairly tight. Smells nice...a lot of espresso there and some chocolate notes. Tasty and straight forward.
One thing that strikes me is how smooth and creamy the mouthfeel is. Really feels like a dessert beer here on the tongue. Taste wise, it definitely has the coffee in bunches there and the typical dark chocolate notes...but what I'm struck by is how pleasantly sweet the beer is. There aren't any real bitter notes to speak of here....it isn't really roasted....it's just smooth, creamy, and rather sweet. So tasty, this is what I wish coffee stouts were ALWAYS like! 719 charactersNODAK, Dec 08, 2013

4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From the 330 ml. bottle. Sampled on November 30, 2013.
It pours deep black with a small but lingering beige head that eventually fizzles down. Opaque.
Everything about the aroma screams subtle. There are dark roasted malts and coffee but nothing that is in my face.
Medium body and reasonably smooth.
The taste is like the aroma with a dark malty character, mild sweetness, and more earthy bitterness at the end. You wouldn't know this to be a 9.3% ABV beer because the alcohol is non-existent. Yet while is has some good Impy Stout characters it is definitely not in your face. 582 characterspuboflyons, Nov 30, 2013

Appearance: Black as motor oil but not as thick, some imperial stouts just pour thicker this one in particular comes off thin and so does the tan head is produces, maybe 1/4" off the body settling to nada before the first sip. 
Smell: Robust hit of coffee with a nutmeg type of infusio to go with it. Its a tad light but honestly you can't stop sniffing it. 
Taste: Complex and sweet, the feeling of espresso with pieces of super dark bitter chocolate. Honestly it gets better and better you go down further into the glass, borderline perfect. 
Mouth: You know maybe after the third sip you realize that this brew comes off a notch dry, like coffee. One thing i have to give props to is the stickiness to it, like gum under your shoe. 
Overall: I have passed this up o the shelf many times at one of my local beer spots and absolutely will not ever do it again. It isn't my favorite imperial stout but definitely hits the top five.Chuck the money and buy a bottle....Salud! 1,006 charactersBlurryVisi0n, Nov 24, 2013

Smell is of huge brewed black coffee, dark chocolate, molasses and faint vanilla. Very inviting. 
Taste is of black coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt and maple syrup with a slightly bitter finish.
Mouthfeel is silky smooth and heavy bodied with medium carbonation.
Impressive big coffee and dark chocolate aroma and flavors combine with a velvety mouthfeel. A world class breakfast stout. 517 charactersFurlinator, Nov 23, 2013
4.56/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Poured into an Elysian snifter. A two bottle vertical of a fresh 2013 bottle and a properly aged 2009 bottle. 
2013:
Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours pitch black with leaving a thin tan layer and ring around the glass, leaving light lacing bands. Nice aroma of tasted malt, chocolate, coffee and hints of vanilla and dark dried fruit; light liqueur alcohol. Flavor of rich toasted, lightly charred malt, aromatic coffee, chocolate, light nuts. Finishes with charred coffee and malt, light hop bitterness. Medium bodied. A beautifully balanced and flavorful coffee stout. Touches all the expected toasted / char malt and rich coffee notes with all well melded. 
2009:
Poured into a Reuben's Brew snifter. Pours opaque black with light patchy tan foam and a ring around the glass that leave a surprising amount of speckled lacing. Nice sweet toasted malt, vanilla and dark dried fruit aroma, reminiscent of a high quality mild stout, but more complex. No evident coffee nor alcohol. Flavor is very well melded toasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, wood, coffee char, hints of dark fruit. Finishes with distinct coffee and almost the same level of light hop bitterness as the fresh bottle. Medium bodied with hints of creaminess. This aged bottle has lost some of the bright toasted malt and coffee notes, but has all the flavors very well blended with light woody character as if it were barrel aged (probably oxidation elements, but much more nicely balanced then the typical cardboard flavors of aged beers). I am pleased by the survival of the coffee and hop character of this aged stout. It has aged very nicely and become even more balanced (and the fresh one is well balanced) and interesting. This is a world class stout. I intend to age this one again.
This is one of my favorite breweries and this only cements its place in my heart. 
The score is a blend of both vintages; they are quite different, but no score is very much different between the two. 1,964 charactersLiquidAmber, Nov 23, 2013

Poured blacker than black even when held up to the light... Dirty burnt brown head poured a big, thick bubbling mass then faded fairly quickly to decent thickish covering.. lots of patchy sticky lacing...
Aroma - Strong roasted coffee to the fore, leathery and slightly sooty, charcoal notes, toasted bread, chocolate maltiness, Tia Maria liqueur, vanilla, burnt toffee, treacle, earthy / cardboard hints, some buttery traces, light nuttiness, some light date and black cherries fruitiness, alcohol just noticeable...
Taste - Lots of charred roasted dark chocolate malt bitterness mixed with strong espresso coffee, sooty, vanilla, some faint piney hops, earthy, toffee, toasted nutty sweetness, some treacle, faint anise
Feel - Smooth and fairly creamy... medium to full bodied... a pretty quaffable brew for 9.5%...
Overall - An outstanding stout... I've read about this one since i first got into craft beer and i wasn't disappointed now that i've finally got to try it... highly recommended 1,046 charactersmdagnew, Nov 19, 2013

Pours a beautiful thick black with a tiny tan head, good lacing. Smell is coffee upfront with some chocolate notes. Taste is coffee, but not as bitter as a lot of coffee stouts. I also get some milk chocolate and vanilla. Silky and smooth. Full bodied with a low amount of carbonation that works well with this beer.

Poured into a snifter, the brew had no head whatsoever, and amazed me with its pure thick dark black color. Carbonation is medium-strong and offers contrast to the thickness of the beer. Peche Mortel smells like espresso more than it smells like beer. No strong recognizable hop aromas come through, just the beautiful dense smell and flavor of pure dark chocolate and espresso. The beer truly hides the 9.5% alcohol well, even while warming. Toffee is also the only recognizable third flavor besides chocolate and coffee. This is a deep dark imperial espresso blast; a complex offering that is a peak example of the style. 713 charactersBenHesk12, Nov 11, 2013
4.19/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25From a 340 ml bottle into a snifter. A five and eight are notched into the label in some sort of date code. Reviewed from notes dated October 24, 2013.
A-The pour is thick and heavy with about one and one-half fingers of medium-brown foam to start. Retention is decent; at over two minutes there is still a thick cap. A bit of lace clings to the glass. The brew is inky black. Good-looking stuff.
S-The smell is, as you might expect, coffee-forward with nice roasty, semi-sweet chocolate scents, too. Unlike some coffee beers, I detect more beans than brewed coffee here, which adds to the roast flavors and reduces the bitterness. In addition to the coffee, I smell a bit of anise and dark berry fruit, like blueberry. 
T-The taste is smooth, creamy, and rich. I taste milk and dark chocolate, brewed coffee, cocoa, and a bit of vanilla. I also taste some of the licorice flavor I smelled. It is not as intense as I had hoped, but not a bad brew by any stretch.
M-The feel is thick, substantial, and carbonation is low. Hearty and excellent for the style.
O-This is a very good beer, but perhaps because my expectations for this brew were high, I felt a bit let-down. The coffee flavors are nice, but a bit dull and metallic when compared against the best of the style. On the other hand, the balance between coffee and beer is nice and unlike some beers, you don't feel like your drinking charred, bitter coffee grounds. 1,427 charactersspoony, Nov 11, 2013

A-About half a finger of a tight, creamy, mocha-colored head. Beer leaves its mark on the glass. Pours quite dark, though some light is able to get through on the edges.
S-Like a friggin' shot of espresso. Coffee and roastiness dominate the nose. Some sweetness is there, and comes out more as it warms, but the roast dominates.
T-This beer makes sure you know that it's an imperial coffee stout. So much espresso. If you don't like coffee, don't even think about drinking this beer. I like coffee. And I love the flavor on this beer. Some dark chocolate is present, but this is an espresso bomb.
M-On the lighter side of a full-bodied stout. There is slight carbonation, but not enough to make you question this beer's status as an imperial stout. The espresso will not leave you alone, and just stays in your mouth... I ain't mad.
Damn good beer. I stuck one in the cellar, but I'm questioning whether that's really necessary. Not sure of the age on this one. Can't imagine it's too old. This beer is brilliantly bold. The name, when translated, means "mortal sin." I heard a person say once, "If you don't love your sin, you're not doing it right." I love this sin. 1,214 charactersjbwimer, Nov 02, 2013

3.36/5  rDev -23.6%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Two weeks ago I had my first beer tasting event. At that time, this was served and was not received very well. I decided to by another bottle ($6.99 at Total Wine) and try it on my own to write a review.
Poured from a 11.5 oz. brown bottle with the date code there but smudged and into a snifter. I get 1/2 fingers of head. I reviewed this beer based upon its style.
A: Pours the darkest brown opaque color with 1/2 fingers of tan, crater head that dissipates quickly. Little lacing.
S: Very strong smell of coffee and a little vanilla.
T: Strong coffee and coffee. It is like having an iced coffee with alcohol in it. The alcohol to be sure is well hidden, though.
M: Medium bodied and smooth. It is a sipper, though. So strong is the coffee infusion that it cannot be enjoyed any other way. I can enjoy it somewhat by sipping. Very warming.
O: First of all, I don't care for it and I would not have it again. This is a perfect example of Personal Taste. I don't really get the rave reviews. I like Deschutes Black Butte Porter but this is not a style that I will probably gravitate to. 1,093 charactersJohnnyJam, Oct 14, 2013

Black but translucent, visible yeast that I carelessly let slip into my glass... OOPS. It's okay, this beer looks damn fine. Caramel in color, a decent head forms but dies rather quickly with no lacing.
The nose is all coffee and boy does it smell good. Faint phenol, roast and chocolate.
When I taste this I think of a well made cappuccino, pungent espresso flavor and aromas, softened by frothed milk. Bitter chocolate with a burnt flavor, like the edges of a brownie pan when they've been left in the oven too long. Subtle smoke, the finish isn't overly bitter or astringent, it doesn't dry ones mouth out completely like many others of the style. Very well done.
This beer is as full of body as it is flavor. Balanced and enjoyable until the very end. I would go as far as to say that this is one of the best coffee stouts I have had that has not been aged in a barrel. 936 charactersMarkJBurch, Oct 13, 2013

The body is deep and beautiful, an obsidian gem, but the lack of any real head is slightly disappointing. Scents of coffee, roast malt, chocolate and slight soy sauce. A nose that is quite coffee heavy, predicting the beer's flavor. Flavors of black coffee, espresso and roast malt. Slight undertones of dark chocolate and cocoa powder. The black coffee and roast malt biterness linger on the aftertaste The flavors greatly increase in intensity as the beer warms, becoming very rich and satisfying. It's incredibly forward on the coffee and roasted malt, which is excellent. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with moderate carbonation, quite a good sipper, despite it's 9.5% ABV there is no alcohol warmth present. A very good feel, silky, thick and satisfying. Overall this is an amazing Imperial Stout, showcasing it's coffee overtones above all else. It does doing an excellent job at showcasing the rich, deep flavor of quality coffee mingled with the roasted malt of a fine stout. Highly recommended. 1,056 charactersAuraan, Oct 12, 2013

4.03/5  rDev -8.4%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4- Pours a deep black/brown with small layer of chocolatey foam.
- Huge roasted coffee nose, with some hints of a strong stout beneath.
- Very coffee forward with a strong roasty mouth. Taste resembles ground esspresso at first, but then turns into full bodied stout. Definitely tasting, but also lacking balance with overpowering coffee bitterness. 
- Overall a quality beverage, no doubt, but also too bitter/unbalanced. I can imagine the barrel age ones add a lot to balance the coffee and provide complexity. 514 charactersdeschutes_fan, Oct 12, 2013

Pours a dark brown body with a thin tan head of half a finger thickness which dissipates quickly with minimal lacing.
Smells of roasted whole coffee beans, burnt toast, vanilla, cacao, and toffee.
Taste is heavy on coffee and roasted malts. Surprisingly bitter, both from hops and coffee. Not as much on the chocolate or vanilla taste as the smell might suggest. 
Feel is medium bodied, moderately carbonated, dry finish. I prefer my imperial stouts thicker, coating the tongue more than this.
Overall a nice coffee stout which I enjoyed but not a top-ten for the category by any means, and I'm surprised by the level of hype this receives. 695 charactersMCain04, Oct 10, 2013

A- Pours a big mocha brown frothy head, 3 fingers worth. Head dissipates slowly, very sticky lacing. The color is pitch black, absolutely no light coming through this one. 
S- The aroma is amazing, one of the biggest coffee aromas i have ever smelled in a beer. Big roasty notes, roasted coffee beans, malt, roasted dark cocoa.
T- Big big coffee taste, love it, like drinking straight up cold coffee, big roasted notes, bitter cocoa, slight chocolate taste but very minimal, roasted coffee takes over this one.
M- Big mouthfeel, this one coats your palate with nice coffee notes, very sticky, taste lingers for a while, well carbonated.
O- I've only had this one time before back when i first got into beer, and i was too much of a rookie back then to really appreciate this one. I love this beer, and wish it was more available in the States. If your a coffee lover this is the beer for you. The alcohol in this one being at 9.5% is no where to be seen. Highly recommend this. 1,041 charactersChriscrundwell12, Oct 05, 2013

T: Follows the nose. Dark malts and coffee dominate the taste. Bitter finish that lingers for a while.

Basically ran out of room in my shipper full of beer to take home, so I decided to drink this one in the hotel room the night before. Opened 9/30/2013.
Pours a thick, viscous black body with a nice 1cm mocha brown head that looks incredibly creamy and fluffy.. like a latte. Good head retention for a stout, no lacing.
Smelled like straight up milk chocolate and roast coffee. Not a very complex nose, but it is damn delicious and definitely brings its game.
Flavour is very full of lactose and black coffee bitterness.. some milk chocolate sweetness rounds it out along with that sweet lactose flavour. Overall this is a coffee bomb. Very bold flavour, not complex but definitely keeps you interested and enjoying it.
Good thick body, good carbonation, smooth, super creamy with a dry, bitter coffee finish. No hints of alcohol heat. 
Delicious coffee stout. The coffee may be a bit too strong for some, but as a man who loves his coffee black like the devil's soul, this is a fantastic beer. Its price point ($5.99 for a 12oz bottle) makes it a once-in-a-while treat, but it is certainly a delicious treat. 1,179 charactersStevedore, Sep 30, 2013

S: Strong roasted coffee smell! Almost can't make out anything else but roasted coffee, but I do also get a little hint of milk chocolate and vanilla, the chocolate and vanilla give it almost a creamy smell to it which is very nice, blends fantastically and smells amazing
The only problem I have is that the aroma isn't very strong, you really have to smell the beer to pick up the aroma, I don't know if it's just the bottle that I got or if this is normal, but it is a little disappointing that the aroma isn't stronger
T: Loads of coffee! It's almost like you're drinking iced coffee (just not as cold). Slight taste of chocolate and cream follows after the nice roasted coffee flavor, very nice blend of flavors
Almost no alcohol presence at all
M: Medium bodied, slightly creamy, it is oily as well but it feels like there's just a little something missing here, can't quite figure it out
O: Great Imperial Stout, easily one of the best coffee stouts I've had, if you love coffee, this is the beer for you! 1,113 charactersbpasquini, Sep 24, 2013

Smells like strong, espresso like coffee. The dominant smell really- it's amazing but slightly one-note.
Tastes incredible. Strong, bitter, nutty coffee flavors dominate- one of the best coffee flavors in a beer I've ever had. Further flavors of creamy vanilla, chocolate, licorice, slight hop bitterness and roasty bitterness are well received in my mouth.
The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, and medium-thick. Low carbonation.
One of the best coffee stouts, if not the best, you'll ever find. Wow. 613 charactersGreesyFizeek, Sep 23, 2013

Black hole black with a a light, mocha colored head, comprised of very fine and thin bubbles, leaving a clear-cut separation between the brew and the foam. Almost floats up and perches like the type of head you'd expect in a nitro-tap brew. Impressive looking little coffee stout, here... hold the cream and sugar, no doubt.
The aroma is unadulterated, straight up dark, roasted coffee. Italian espresso roast. Burnt ass French roast. Just insanely roasted, oily, dark, nearly burnt and charred coffee beans. Whoa... what's this? There's a very faint, underlying sweetness in the form of creamy vanilla that works to balance the roast. But balance isn't the key, here. The appreciation of fresh coffee beans is, so step back and appreciate, son.
The taste is more of the same. Lovers of all things java will appreciate this brew like crazy. Dark roast, like you've been handed a roasty, black cup o' joe from the promise land itself. A mild creamy and milky undertaking soothes things out for the wimp in all of us - but the roastiness is still a monster here, imparting delicate bitterness and mounds upon mounds of fresh coffee flavor.
A little astringency on the very back end with a subtle touch of deep, depp prune-like sweetness. Wow, I'm loving the ride that this beer is taking me on. The mouth feel is as oily as the beer looks; thick and boisterous, taking no prisoners. Carbonation is but a rolling boil, and it works really well to retain the creamy and smooth characteristic of the beer, matching the flavor profile nicely.
I had always heard about this stuff and wondered if it was really as good as everyone says. Short answer... yes, it is. It's fabulous. If you're a coffee lover and addict, like myself, then you need to treat yourself with this beer. The coffee element is nearly second to none with it's excellent aroma, flavor, and layered characteristics. Definitely one of the top coffee stouts I've had to date. 1,970 characterstectactoe, Sep 22, 2013

Aroma is coffee, licorice, plums and sweet cherries.
Taste starts with buttery maple syrup and milk chocolate. Then the coffee and dark cocoa comes in, which is wonderful with almost no bitterness. On the finish I get notes of tobacco, oak, vanilla, sweet creamy butter and a touch of bitterness. Alcohol taste is nowhere to be found.
Oily and chewy in the mouth. No carbonation, but I'm not sure I'm missing it much.

This is what makes Canada such a great place to visit. Beers like this and La Monde du Fin are a cut above most USA crafts. Go to Montreal during Jazz Festival, the first week of July. Find these beers.
Drink them instead of the crappy Henniken they serve at the festival. 365 charactersricknelson, Sep 07, 2013

Appearance is essentially spot on for the style. Rich, colorless black meets hints of dark suede brown. A one finger khaki head rises from the liquid's surface.
Smell is this beer's weak point. While certainly above average, the aroma is thin. Most notable are bold-roast coffee, cacao nibs, light vanilla, and surprising alcohol given the beer's relatively low ABV. 
Taste recaptures Peche Mortel's true character. Lots of cocoa and coffee jump to the front of the palate. Coffee bitterness is evident but enjoyable. Again, surprising alcohol burn rises through the nose while sitting on the tongue. Nougat and caramel finish the profile, which sits forever on the taste buds.
Mouthfeel is a major highlight. Body is medium and wonderfully creamy. The texture of this beer is a true work of brewing art. 
Overall, this is a beer that should never be forgotten in the midst of so many bigger and supposedly better beers. A true world class effort that I'm always happy to find on a shelf. Now, to make myself a hypocrite and find the bourbon barrel-aged version! 1,216 charactersjsboots21, Aug 31, 2013

Roasted coffee, chocolate, caramel. Crazy malts. It smells creamy.
You could run out of superlatives describing this beer. The taste is fantastic. Coffee, roasted grains, char, chocolate, caramel, smoke, alcohol, cream. 
It's creamy and smooth. It's bitter in the finish. It's chocolatey and strong. There's some smoke to help the transition from creamy and smooth to bitter and strong. As it warms, the bitterness really takes over. 
Overall, it's bordering on perfection across the board. While it's high in ABV, it's easy to drink, mostly because it's so good. The alcohol is well-hidden, but just present enough to let you know it's a manly beer. Really an exceptional beer. 897 charactersRickS95, Aug 30, 2013

Not sure what all the "ho-ha" is about with this beer. It is a good beer, but not great. Sort one dimensional taste without enough body. Beautiful nose but it goes downhill from there. It’s a top 250 beer so most will want to try just to tic, but I have warned you so don’t be disappointed.
A – Pours black with good carbonation, but only a small light brown head (-), which quickly dissipates.
S – Coffee followed by chocolate dominates. Slightly sweet. Some alcohol but not solventy. Even some faint licorice.
T – Coffee and coffee bitterness, roasted malts. Some alcohol but hides its 9.5% ABV well.
MF – A smooth start, a little fizzy on the palate. Medium bodied, but thinner than expected (-). Medium-dry finish. 893 charactersSludgeman, Aug 30, 2013

S: Strong java; espresso-like. Chocolate. Vanilla. Hints of toffee and caramel. Smells a bit like S'mores.
T: Black coffee slaps the palate right upfront. Actually tastes like a caramel flavored coffee with vanilla added. Tons of sweet chocolate and dark chocolate bitterness in the finish - almost like a rolo or caramello candy bar.
M: Medium body. Moderate carbonation - maybe a bit too much for the style. Bitey. Sharp.
O: This is mega complex. Delightful. Great dessert or breakfast beer. The coffee is abundantly strong, but the chocolate offsets the java bitterness wonderfully. 695 charactersJustin_Neff, Aug 25, 2013

Bottled 3/2005
I bought this bottle about one year ago and have cellered since. This bad boy hasn't lost any carbonation in the 2+ years since bottling. Opens with a nice pffftt and pours black as the devils soul. This black hole of a beer swallows every ray of light that dares venture near. A two finger creamy brown head appeared on the pour and became craggy before slowly falling to a thick crown. Leaves some great sheet lacing as it settles and then after each drink. World class looking stout.
Although this beer is a couple years old the coffee is by far first and foremost in the aroma. There's not just a hint of coffee here and there but a couple shots of espresso. The espresso still dominates. Once I get past the coffee there's a solid dose of dark chocolate with a slight bitter character and roasted barley. Peche Mortel is one of those beers that get your heart beating faster from the first inhale. 
Well, the flavor manages to outdo even the aroma. This is a coffee bomb yet somehow, as strong as it is, doesn't overpower you in the least. While the coffee shows off it's greatness throughout there's a great wave of dark chocolate on the swallow. This manages to balance things out perfectly before the espresso takes over the entire profile. Roasted barley makes itself known quietly in the background.
The mouthfeel is perfect on this beer. The body is big boned but not heavy which makes this beer go down incredibly smooth. The carbonation is actually slightly higher (moderate in this case) than expected which keeps things moving nicely.
I find it extremely hard giving such a big stout a perfect score for drinkability. While this is about as close as you can get for such a big beer the alcohol and caffeine keep it from getting that 5. If you drank the night away with this beer you'd be bouncing off walls one minute and falling asleep the next. Well, maybe not but you catch my drift right?
Peche Mortel is a stout of the highest quality. I don't drink coffee very often but I love me a good coffee infused beer. This is one if not the best coffee infused beer I've ever had. Not only that but it's one of the best stouts I've ever expierenced. I only wish I had a few more bottles sitting aside. This is a must try lie, cheat, or steal do whatever it takes to get yourself a bottle of Peche Mortel. 2,350 charactersjoe1510, Aug 19, 2013

Appearance: Pours out real smooth, pitch black, with a mocha head that stuck around for a while. Not too much lacing.
Smell: Hershey's chocolate syrup. Coffee, roasted malt, chocolate. Very sweet and sticky. Hard sniff gives way to a tiny bit of alcohol on the back end. I couldn't stop smelling this beer.
Taste: The best coffee stout I've had to date. From front to back: roasted malt, fresh roasted coffee beans, chocolate syrup, bitter hops, clean finish. Wow. I could easily drink this for breakfast and be satisfied. No alcohol, impressive for 9.5%.
Mouthfeel: Creamy, silky, chewy. Feels almost like chocolate milk on the tongue. Bittering hops on the back end keep everything smooth and not cloying.
Overall: Great stout, found the last bottle in my local shop, lucky to have picked it up. This one will knock your socks off. 919 charactersTastefulNudity, Aug 12, 2013

Pours a dark brown/black with a half inch beige head that lingers for a long while. One of the most impressive lacings ive ever seen on a stout, too. Smell is big on coffee and chocolate and charred malts. The taste is extremely smooth and hits you with a big chocolate flavor right off, followed by a good espresso kick and a nice bit of burned malt flavor. You get a lingering char feel in your mouth with this one too, it stays with you. Body is so creamy, the complete opposite of syrupy and is very impressive from a big stout. Hard to even call this full bodied, its more medium bodied which is very surprising for a stout like this. Not necessarily a sipper but why wouldnt you?
Overall not quite FBS tier but its close. A very impressive coffee infused imp stout and one that is super easy to drink. However, the price point is a bit high. Still, if this was available regularly around me i'd more than happily consume it regularly. 1,072 charactersAxnjxn, Aug 11, 2013

Pours a slick black with a fuzzy, tan-colored head. It smells like chocolate, big roasted malts, but hardly any coffee. The taste is similar. The roasted malts really take over the beer. Dark, bitter chocolate, burnt toast, strong bitterness, slight coffee vibes. As it warms, the coffee starts to come out more. There’s not a huge amount of depth but the flavors work very well here. Mouthfeel is decent, but not as good as it could be – there might be a little too much carbonation…it feels a little harsh with all the bitter roasted malts. This is still a very solid imperial stout. 620 charactersgreenmtn1111, Aug 08, 2013

Tried one with only 2 months age and there was quite a difference between the two. The alcohol had really smoothed out on this one and I wasn't left with the afterburn that came with the fresher one. Great coffee and chocolate flavours, lots of malty complexity. Gets better as it heats up a bit. 
Admittedly, I still prefer Aphrodisiaque to Péché Mortel, though I was very happy to have given this a good aging to perfect it. This beer has a lot of complex flavours that were drowned out by the alcohol last time. Wish I would have aged a few more. 609 charactersIvanhoes_Backpack, Jul 30, 2013

It pours a thick black color with a two and a half finger head that has serious staying power. Head is tan-light brown, muddy brown, or dark tea stained- however you want to picture it. It is extremely creamy in texture. Honestly, stouts just don't get much better looking than this. Lacing is great. 
Nose: Very nice balanced coffee and beer aroma, the roast from the grain mixes in very nicely with the coffee. Chocolate aromas as well. Coffee isn't very foreground in the aroma, but its there supporting the stoutish character of this beer. Small hints of smoked grain aroma. As it warms I start to get hazelnut aromas.
Tongue: This is a big stout. Mouthfeel is full and it feels excellent on the palate. Roasted grain bitterness is evident and I'll honestly say that coffee here isn't too prevalent. Its much more of a Russian Imperial with hints of coffee. Alcohol is evident and adds some warmth and complexity. This is an awesome imperial stout, but the coffee just doesn't punch its way through as much as I would have thought. This is a very well done beer, layers of flavor but not easily distinguishable, it all melds together and works well together to create a large depth of flavor. 
Drinkability: This is one I'd definitely buy again. However; if I'm looking for a big coffee taste this one is a bit more hidden, melded in with the flavors of the beer itself. Definitely a complex beer and one you should check out. 1,490 charactersbecktone, Jul 28, 2013

Look - Pours a thick almost oil viscosity black with a smaller soapy mocha head that dissipates quickly and leave abundant lacing chunks and rings.
Smell - Rich velvety coffee and sweet chocolate. Roasted malts/barley underneath. Some bitter hops at the end.
Taste - Creamy chocolate with a little carbonated bite and then roasted coffee. Ends with a slight warm in the throat and hop bitter.
Mouthfeel - Rests slightly sticky and more towards a medium body than heavy. Booziness is just right warm throat and stomach.
Overall - Another great brew from one hell of a brewery. Though the cost is a bit steep here in the states, this is worth snagging once in a while for sure. 779 charactersJMScowcroft, Jul 24, 2013

Previous rating was A: 2.0 S: 4.0 T: 4.0. M: 4.0 O: 4.25
A:
Pours jet black with a finger of foamy brown head that sticks around quite a while before becoming a solid thick film, easily swirled to its former glory. Good retention; lacing.
S:
Roast coffee and dark fruits. Cherries, rubber, smoke, leather, coffee, chocolate, vanilla.
T:
Coffee. Burnt coffee grounds, hard water, dark fruits, roast malt, lingering coffeeboozemalt tingle.
M:
Thin, medium to full bodied with a very rich velvety palate and a nice coffee aftertaste.
O:
Delicious flavored stout.
I am relatively certain that I had a bad bottle (or an off batch or something) the first time I had/reviewed this beer. It was a fizzy, thin, pretty okay tasting but whatever. However, returning to it I find a beer that looks great in the glass, smells amazing (neither too stout nor too coffee) and gives you HT-like waves of coffee and malt (around 4 actually). While I am still far from a fan of random flavors being added to beers, this is a good beer and would even be loved by a coffee lover not entirely into beer.
Would have again; worth seeking out.
Goes to show you should always think twice before writing stuff off (even with a bad experience). 1,297 charactersTheDoctor, Jul 17, 2013

A- Pours an opaque black with a two finger tan head of largish bubbles that recedes slowly, leaving spotty lacing.
S- A deep rich nose of roasted malt, dark roast coffee, and molasses. Hints of dark fruit, vanilla, and grains (I want to say oats and wheat, but I could be wrong) are also noticeable. There is a bit of booze in the nose as it warms.
T- The flavor is definitely dominated by roasted flavors of both coffee and malt. There is significant bitterness, but it doesn't seem to be much from the hops, though there is a vinous hoppy flavor in the middle. Bitter baker's chocolate flavor and a bitter coffee bite at the end. A touch of brown-sugar sweetness balances the bitterness just enough.
M- The mouthfeel is medium-thick, mostly smooth, but with a bit more carbonation than I prefer for the style. A bit of booze is perceived, but not too much considering the abv.
O- Overall this is an excellent coffee stout that I would be happy to drink any day despite minor flaws! 1,166 charactersSadMachine, Jul 14, 2013

A - Black with no light and a small beige head that dissipates quickly. It's a quick fizz of large bubbles that can't reach freedom fast enough.
S -The coffee hit me quickly but it was then joined by chocolate and roasted malts.
T - Again, starts heavy on the coffee but is followed and supported by chocolate and mild roasted malts. A hint of sweetness. Nicely balanced flavors and very smooth.
M - Silky smooth and somewhat creamy with a nice low carbonation. 
O - Very tasty but also very smooth. Well worth a try. 571 charactersGJ40, Jul 10, 2013

not much head, had a nice brown appearance. Nothing striking or off putting.
smelled great. big coffee aroma.
Tasted wonderful. Strong coffee taste, but surprisingly not overpowering. The base is just a nice solid stout.
I hate rating mouthfeel. it felt good?
Overall, try this beer if you can find it. I was taken aback that it was a twist off cap bottle. Not sure why, but it is proof good beer can come from any form of vessel, including a twist-off bottle. 499 charactersrhartogsq, Jul 08, 2013

My goodness, I smell vanilla beans, milk chocolate, coffee, nothing but good sweetness to it. Slight caramel tone to it.
Vanilla, chocolate milk flavors followed by some coffee and strong bitterness on the tongue. Slight alcohol burn in the aftertaste, which is dry and bready.
Feels creamy, silky and smooth. Nice carbonation.
An amazing imperial stout from DDC. The bottle says bottled on January 2013, so it's only about half a year old. Tastes nice - though I'm hoping to age a few bottles for a few years and see how it improves, hopefully with the alcohol burn gone. Great beer. 673 charactersScrylol, Jul 06, 2013

A: Very, very dark brown. Small amber head that quickly retreats to a fine rim. Mildly viscous and leaves a slight amber layer on the side of the glass. Not much when it comes to lacing.
S: Not very fragrant. Bitter coffee, earthy, dusty. Aroma increases as it opens.
T: Dark malts, coffee, slight bitter, hops. Very strong taste. Not much of a lingering palette.
M: Bold-bodied beer. High Carbonation. Smooth.
O: A great stout that has an excellent balance of coffee and traditional ingredients. The booze was hide very well. 553 charactersmacher0, Jun 28, 2013

A: hahaha - yep espresso! Exceptional mocha notes and quite sweat! Head disappeared super quick but who cares!
S: ABV is not evident due to dominant up front aroma of espresso and bold choc/vanilla backing. Is it a smoothie or a beer?
T: Start is certainly like 'Choc Hops' Stout from Mildura brewery with dominant choc/vanilla sweetness. Mild coffee backs it up to provide mid-palate body (I drink double espresso, so maybe stronger coffee than I state) The main theme for me appears to be the chocolate but goes deeper and longer than that through to a very solid coffee / vanilla end. 
M: Not too thick that the 'new to stout' drinker would be intimidated but certainly a hearty consistency that makes you feel as if you have got what you wanted! Well balanced bitterness and carbonation is almost spot on! 
O: Probably one of the first examples I would reach for to give to a mate who wants to experience the wonderful world of stout! The misses likes chocolate? Give her a taste! Your mate likes coffee? Nudge this fellow his way! Fantastic beer with plenty of aroma, mouthfeel and taste with big ABV that is not at all evident! 1,182 charactersladofmanor, Jun 21, 2013

The scent is nicely varied with chocolate malt, caramel, marshmallow, light espresso and overtures of roasted coffee.
The taste is more coffee-centric, with a strong roast and char presence. Bits of dry chocolate are there but very little sweetness. The beer is smooth, with no visible alcohol presence. Very good flavor, great scent, very good beer. 451 charactersKYGunner, Jun 16, 2013

a: pretty much pitch black. maybe a little dark purple/ruby red at the bottom of the glass. 3 finger tan marshmallowy head
s: smells delicious. sweet toasted malt, tons of milk chocolate, very faint hint if black licorice, some coffee (not as much as i would have liked), fig, smells almost woody/oaky and smokey towards the end. smells really good - hoping there is more coffee in the flavor than the smell
t: roasty toasty malts right away followed by dark toffee and caramel malts. that immediately fades into milk chocolate and smooth coffee and coffee bitterness. there is some (not as much as you'd expect from 9.5%) alcohol in the flavor that cuts the sweetness. dates and raisins on the backend along with some nice bready flavors. all the flavors harmonize really well.
m: fuller side of medium. not much carbonation
o: maybe i had an old bottle but there is not as much coffee flavor in here as i would have liked. HOWEVER even without the abundance of coffee this is still a stellar beer - its delicious and well balance and dangerously drinkable for the abv. i need to get my hands on a bottle i know is fresh 1,158 charactershopsputin, Jun 08, 2013

A: A luscious pitch black topped with a mocha color head. About one finger thick. Sadly it died down pretty rapidly and didn't leave that much lacing but I'm not taking points of because its understandable due to the high alcohol.
S: Coffee grounds are definitely dominant. Alcohol is not noticeable at all.
T: Once again dark coffee flavors come through as most powerful. Deeply roasted malts are also there providing some dark chocolate. Bitterness is really not too potent. Perhaps a bit of dark fruit near the finish but coffee is definitely dominant. Alcohol is once again not at all noticeable and very well hidden. 
M: Very creamy and thick. Carbonation is pretty well done and mild making the beer fairly smooth. Goes down very nicely.
O: Absolutely amazing beer. Definitely recommend it to someone looking for a good Imp. stout, coffee stout, or just great beer. I can't say how much I love this beer and its local for me too. 981 charactersHaydn-Juby, Jun 08, 2013

The espresso flavor is so forward and overpowering that a bag of crushed coffe beans would have the same effect. Now, I know that people love to eat ground coffee beans on their chocolate, on their dessert and sometimes with hot pepper. But alone ground coffe flavor tastes like just that...coffee grounds. For me that was all I could taste. Iced coffee from Dunkin' is not what I want in a beer. Just not my thing.
But if you are one of those people that lives for coffee flavors outside of your morning coffee, this is your beer. It's like that time i accidentally doubled the beans in my morning brew, just cold and with a well hidden alcohol kick. 
If that's your thing, have at it. I will save it all for you. 797 charactersDcunicelli, Jun 01, 2013

Bottled date 5-12
A - pours a nice opaque black with a thick brownish-tan one-finger head. More bubbles than I would've thought but good head retention with minimal lace. 
S - Roasted malts, roasted espresso beans, freshly ground coffee beans, vanilla beans (a pattern is forming) cocoa & toffee. 
T - Coffee leads the way of the aforementioned smells. Lots of roasty goodness. Toffee flavor sits well on tge back end. All in all, great balance of flavors. Alcohol, at least to me, was barely noticeable. 
M - A little syrupy thick and nice heavy mouthfeel. Really smooth. 
O - Awesome version of this style. Now one of my faves. Too bad it took me too long to try this one. Highly recommended for I.S.lovers. 757 charactersJamesStreet, May 28, 2013
4.79/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours a very dark chocolate with no head o speak of. Very light lacing but minimal carbonation. 
Aroma is heavy coffee with secondary alcohol and malt nose. The smell is my favorite part of drinking this beer; its a great beer and well deserving of its high ratings but the smell is so uniquely good. I love holding a glass and sniffing it. 
Palate is like drinking an espresso/stout shandy. Very dominant coffee flavor but very well done. Too often the coffee can taste off or stale if the flavor is too heavy but the coffee part of this stout tastes just as nice as the stout. Other flavors of chocolate, pine and roasty malts. 631 charactersgirlbrew, May 28, 2013

A: Still black with an inviting mocha head that descends into a decent lacing. Has some decent legs. Looks pretty good. 
N: Loads of vanilla, caramel, coffee, and bittersweet chocolate. There's plenty of roasted malt here as well as plenty of brown sugar and sweetness. Even though it's not barrel aged, it has the same presence as a BA beer in terms of smell. 
T: Delicious. Big malt sweetness backed by a strapping of bitter roasted coffee. Also has the sweetness of bread mixed in here. 
M: Rounded and filling mouthfeel with a modicum of carbonation. Alcohol is still lingering here, and it might be one of the few flaws of the beer.
O: This is easily one of the best coffee beers out there, and it's not even barrel aged to add additional flavor. I could, and would, drink a lot of this. 811 charactersSarlacc83, May 26, 2013

A: Very dark brown. Pours a slight, bubbly, brown head. Dissipates quickly, leaving a rumor of carbonation on the surface. Spotty lacing.
S: Charred malt, dark roasted coffee, dark bittersweet chocolate, and a little black licorice and oak.
T: Roasted espresso beans, roasted malt grains, dark chocolate, licorice.... tastes just like it smells.
M: Thick, syrupy, and heavy. Bittersweet throughout. Lingers on the palate. Very smooth. Heavy alcohol is apparent.
D: Sip, savor, and enjoy. It will be gone too soon....
Atmosphere is pretty damn good. Dark intimidating hue, slight bubbly head, and some spotty lacing. Nose is full on roasted grains and coffee beans, chocolate, and licorice, all with a little bit of an oaky character. Tastes like it smells. Very well-balanced combination of roasted grains and espresso, accentuated with a hint of bittersweet dark chocolate, and bitter licorice. Thick and hearty, yet soft and smooth.

A: Pours a deep dark black with one full finger of dark khaki colored head. The foam fades fairly rapidly, leaving a thin clingy layer of bubbles across the top of the beer. Excellent lacing as it drinks.
S: The nose is roasted malt, toasted chestnuts, milk chocolate, coffee, and a touch of sweet vanilla. Smells excellent.
T: This beer starts out sweet and creamy with milk chocolate, vanilla, and marshmallow. The coffee notes of this beer dominate in the middle, but the beer remains creamy. As it moves to the back end, I get a lot of roast and toast. It tightens up with big dark chocolate bitters, and burnt toast. It's wonderful.
M: Full bodied beer. It's sweet and creamy to start, silky smooth in the middle, and gets almost bitterly dry in the finish.
O: Excellent beer. One of my favorites. I can't believe it took me this long to finally review it. I need more of this as soon as possible. 949 characterstrxxpaxxs, May 21, 2013

Inky, oily, black pour. Half finger creamy tan head. Lacing is excellent.
Obviously coffee right up front, with some chocolate and vanilla with a touch of brown sugar and licorice. Some molasses with burnt toast and some figs.
Massive amounts of coffee, bittersweet chocolate with a touch of smoke and vanilla. Molasses with some licorice.
Creamy medium body, low carbonation, Slightly syrupy. Sticky on the lips.
This beer is truly part of the top echelon of beers for a reason. I've had this many times and it never ceases to amaze. 563 characterskorguy123, May 08, 2013

On tap at Dieu Du Ciel! Pours a pitch black color with an inch of frothy khaki head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is boozey with some nice coffee, roasted malts and smoke. Hints of chocolate but the main focus is the roasted coffee. The taste is no surprise, coffee, along with some sweet chocolate, roasted malts and earth. Maybe even hints of licorice. Not a huge alcohol presence. Silky and creamy. This one is almost like a delicious coffee milkshake. Good mix of roasted coffee and earthiness. Overall, outstanding brew I'm glad I got to have on tap. I look forward to drinking the bottles I grabbed as well. 672 charactersPicoPapa, May 04, 2013

Appearance: This beer poured a one finger mocha head that reduced to a thin layer and left some lacing on the glass. It is a pitch black color with no clarity, but bubbles can be seen towards the top of the glass. Super nice lacing on the glass as the beer was drank.
Smell: nice roasted coffee, chocolate, molasses, smoke, and the booze is hidden really well.
Taste: Coffee is upfront like the label says. Nice and roasty with some chocolate, sweetness, and warm booze in there.
Mouthfeel: Silky smooth, full bodied, low to medium carbonation, very drinkable, and nice warming booze.
Overall: A nice find when I was up in Portland, ME. I have always wanted to try this beer out and happy to finally have had a bottle. Now I need to get more. 789 charactersFlounder57, Apr 30, 2013

Aroma is dominated by espresso and hints of chocolate.
Taste is again espresso in its fullest, with bittersweet chocolate intermingled.
Mouthfeel is viscous and smooth.
Overall, a world class coffee imperial stout. Very fortunate to try it. 415 charactersFloppyDog, Apr 25, 2013

The aroma has coffee, bitter chocolate, a malted and roasted sweetness, possibly a hint of vanilla. 
The flavor upfront is great. There starts off with this creamy, yet bitter espresso and chocolate. Then there’s a hint of alcohol at the end of the mouth and top of the throat. The finish has a huge amount of hop and roasted espresso bitterness for a Russian Imperial. This is not a sweet beer nor does the malt linger and stick. There also is this smokiness that I pick up because I’ve recently had KBS. The dark tobacco character lingers around with both flavor and aroma.
The mouthfeel is not as velvety and thick and round as some other Russian Imperials, but that’s fine. It is quite drinkable because of the clean tongue finish.
Be sure to let this warm up from refrigerator temperature. It opens up to be creamier. The flavors roll around the mouth. The bitter espresso just melds into this smokey finish. It is just wonderful.
This is unmatched in complexity for a non-barrel aged beer and even beats some barrel aged beers. 1,127 charactersdar482, Apr 20, 2013

A- Pours very black with a half finger of an off white head.
S- A massive roasted malt. A slight bit of a dark chocolate with an underlying coffee note. 
T- A big roastyness at first. A bit of a BBQ smokiness made it into this beer. A dominant coffee flavor in this beer. A very dry aftertaste. A big roasty malt takes up most of the beer but seems to branch off to cocoa and dark chocolate. This beer is much smokier then I imagined but it works quite well. 
M- Thick and very dry. This syrupy stout is a flavorful sipper and to be appreciated.
O- A solid stout to say the least. A wee bit pricey (7$) but definitely worth trying once. I would love to try the bourbon barrel version. 726 charactersTwelveOunces, Apr 18, 2013

Aroma: lot's of black licorice ju jubes, some coffee and chocolate round out the roast; on the sweet side; a bit of dried herb
Taste & Mouthfeel: beautiful flavour and texture, great medium roast coffee with a light and airy body - like you're just drinking the crema - but not watery; has an acidic and fairly well hopped finish with good length, carrying the coffee and anise flavour with it for perfect balance, kind of like it's burning the flavour into your palate - it's a great way to cap it off; bitter dark cocoa powder gains more of a presence as you get through the beer
Overall: amazingly luxurious mouthfeel, and a robust flavour that grows more complex with every sip; pair it with some berries for dessert 831 charactersBGDrock, Apr 15, 2013

There were 2 fingers of khaki brown head that slowly dissipated down to some nice Belgian lacing. The nose is pretty dreamy, but not as intense as I anticipated. Rich, deep espresso notes with just a hint of sweetness behind it.
Full body and a deep, coffee-infused flavor. Lots and lots of coffee assaults your palate, but the beer is not overly bitter. The feel is creamy enough to enhance the flavor, but not so thick it compromises the drinkability. Besides the coffee, there is a slight oaky flavor in the back of the palate. The finish is well-sustained and, obviously, full of coffee. The taste of freshly roasted espresso beans and a hint of baker's chocolate just lingers on and on.
I had heard a lot about this beer and was really excited to finally get a chance to try it. The best part is that I have two more bottles of it to look forward to. If you don't like coffee or coffee stouts, avoid this beer like crazy. If you like coffee-focused beers, seek this one out. It can be a bit pricey, but worth trying once (or three times). 1,192 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Apr 14, 2013
4.88/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've enjoyed this beer many times in the past in a bottle. It's a great imperial stout, I'd rate 4.25 out 5. On tap however, it's a 5 out of 5. Completely different pour and taste. In a bottle, the head is dark and has big bubbles, disappears quickly. On tap, I had it in a tulip glass and the head was over 3/4 glass until it finally settled to about 1\2. And it was not the same head at all, it was thick and creamy. I was wondering if the bar tender gave me the wrong beer but if you google it online, and look at images, you can tell the difference.
On tap, the taste in far better as well. In a bottle, this is a complex and well done imperial stout, one of my favourites. On tap it blew me away. It got better as I got to the bottom and it warmed up a little bit more. 
Buy this beer in a bottle for sure but go out of your way to try this on tap. You will not regret it. 879 charactersBeersquad, Apr 14, 2013

4.79/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.752011 vintage poured into GI goblet
Pour: Hard pour created about a finger of creamy brown looking head. The beer itself is as dark as a big stout and does not allow any light through. Lacing is minimal at best but there is a bit of spotting.
Smell: Even though this bottle has some age on it the coffee is still huge in this but in a genuinely good way. A wonderful aroma of roast, coffee, some vanilla, chocolate and a touch of wood. The coffee aroma is spot on in that it is not over powering yet you know you are getting into a big coffee stout.
Taste: Similar to the nose and again the coffee balance is absolutely perfect with the dark chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla and wood notes. This is one well balanced coffee stout as there is an initial sweetness at the front of the tongue that is quickly pushed aside by the coffee bitterness. The bitterness that follows to the finish is perfect. Not too bitter but yet just right. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied beer with just an unbelievable creamy texture and softness even though it is quite bitter. Carbonation is low. 
Overall: A gem of a beer. This is one well crafted gem in all aspects, especially if you enjoy coffee stouts. This one is hard to beat in the non barrel aged category. Delicious! 1,253 characterssleuthdog, Apr 12, 2013

Smell: Roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, some caramel, vanilla and a slight char. 
Taste: Similar to the aroma with roasty and coffee notes being most prominent. Dark chocolate and burnt malt are present in the finish and aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, creamy, viscous mouthfeel. Medium levels of fine carbonation.
Overall: Good coffee stout and worth picking up if you see it. Though there's nothing that sets it apart from some of the other really excellent coffee stouts out there. 638 charactersJonada, Apr 07, 2013

A: First of all, the most beautiful bottle art ever. Dieu du Ciel trademark. The beer pours a deep black Imperial Stout color forming a one to two fingers brown moka-style head. Thin bubbled and creamy. Retention is low but many spotty molasses lacings are left in the glass as it goes...
S: Strong roasted malts on the nose, followed by notes of coffee and dark chocolate. A bit milky with some notes of wood too
T: Follow the nose. Strong notes of roasted malts. Notes of coffee and dark chocolate. The upfront is slightly sweet becoming deliciously bitter quite quickly. Absolutely delicious roasted bitterness in the end. Again, a bit lactic and woody
M: Creamy, heavy molasses body. Low carbonation. Roasted bitterness aftertaste
O: Delicious Imperial Stout. I was expecting more coffee but, in the end an excellent experience anyway 882 characterseduardolinhalis, Apr 04, 2013

A-jet black with a solid 1 finger mocha head with solid legs and lacing.

T-rich notes of Italian roast coffee and deep earthy notes. Very little hoppiness or sweetness.

A: it is very dark brown the color of black coffee. It is completely opaque and no light passes through. There is a small mocha colored head that fades quickly and leaves an avg size lacing around the top of the glass. 
S:you can definitely smell the coffee a this almost smells like a fresh vup with lots of roasted coffee aroma. There are also some hop aromas and smells that make this smell like a beer As well so there is some balance. Good but not great I expected more perhaps I got a lesser bottle.
T: it's got a straight coffee flavor upfront it has a ceaminess/chocolatiness to it too. The roasted nature of the coffee adds to the dark malts that come out with some sweetness after the upfront coffee flavor. The finish definitely has the coffee bitterness in the finish but it is not overpowering there is good balance 
M: it a has a very smooth and creamy texture too it like a coffee milkshake almost because it is also very thick and heavy. All that beig said it is not overwhelming and very drinkable as the abv is completely hidden
O:this is a really high quality beer the taste could have more coffee to it but is balanced. The aroma needs more power but the feel is supburb. I was not blown away by this beer as I kinda expected but it is really good so I highly recommend it 1,319 charactersPinknuggets, Mar 24, 2013

A: Pours a rich deep dark brown with a coffee khaki colored 2 finger.
S: Let this one warm up. Initially I was getting a weird off aroma that smelled of burnt plastic. After a couple of minutes this one opened up. Huge coffee aroma, right up there with speedway. Intense coffee aroma with hints of chocolate and toffee. 
T: Loaded with coffee, following the nose. The coffee is provided on a creamy smooth wave. Hints of dark chocolate follow, but this is mostly about coffee. 
M: Smooth full bodied and creamy. Slight coffee bitterness finish with a decent amount of carbonation. Hides the 9% VERY well. 
O: Perfect example of how diverse beer can be. This is a coffee stout and an incredible one at that. Highly recommend. 778 charactersCommanderOfAwesome, Mar 16, 2013

Seriously the carbonation was clear but the head was just a ring and despite a full bright light only the slighest cherry edge is visable. This growler's been warming all night and while I'm missing the masssive coffee smell, I do get alot of subtle balanced notes: coffee, chocolate covered cherries, echos of vanilla and lace. It's amazing how smooth and drinkable this is! I get the coffee bitterness, easily fading into subtle vanilla with cherry cola echos. Vanilla, cherry, cola echoing back and forth, then overcome with bitter coffee on the finish. The intesity of the lace on the swirl is impressive, as is the complete cloaking of the abv. Seek this out! 744 characterstemplar316, Mar 10, 2013

Some lacing is left behind on the glass as the head retreats. The aroma of coffee hit the nose even as the beer was being poured. There's some dark roasty malt in the nose that really blends well with the coffee. There's just a touch of chocolate in the nose. There's some nice dark coffee in the flavor with some good dark roasted barley malt in the flavor. The coffee aftertaste lingers in the mouth. There's a touch of chocolate there as well, which is something I found in the nose. I don't even taste the 9.5% ABV. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The drinkability is high for an imperial stout. This is an excellent beer. 721 charactersacevenom, Mar 06, 2013

Couldn't figure out the bottle date so i think it's at about mid life. 
Screw on top!
A lousious black and a tall, thick and creamy head. It's airy and fades leaving great lacing. I like that.
In the aroma one smells a toatal onslaught of roasted coffee. It's bold and powerful and quite intense. I can also smell chocolate and cream and sutle nuiances of roasted malts and barley.
Yeah, this on leans way to the coffee.
I wonder how much caffine is in here because this is a coffee bomber all the way. 
So much coffee flavor but the beer is out of balance. I like balance. Balance in beer is good.
Towards the end I can taste some roasted malts, a bit ashen and gritty, but ther there.
On the palette it coats my tongue and is somewhat prickly. In the aftertaste it is bitter and sports a burnt malt taste.
A strong and intense beer which is also alittle sweet.
I'm glad i found this.It's hard to find. I don't like the unbalanced of the beer. The flavor is good and definitely in the top 5. 1,132 charactersmicromaniac129, Mar 02, 2013

Poured very dark brown color, looking nearly black in the glass, with a moderate size tan head than soon died to a lasting but partial top coat. Leaves the sides the glass well coated with lace after each sip. 
The aroma was loaded with coffee and sweet dark roasted malts. Occasional hints of dark and milk chocolate, as well as vanilla. Not much alcohol present in the aroma of this 9.5% ABV ale, but enough to add some interesting overtones. The rich coffee was a bit too much like used coffee grinds as opposed to fresh ground beans.
T: not surprised to find a pronounced black coffee flavor mixed with a full load of dark roasted malts. Intense, but not at all challenging due, in part, to the excellent sweet/bitter balance. No burnt, charcoal, or other off flavors here. The lingering finish kept a nice mix of roasted malt and coffee, without the unpleasantly high level bitterness that almost always accompanies this.
M – Full bodied, almost thick, with just the right amount of carbonation. The creamy texture leaves the mouth nicely coated and would earn a 5 if not for the slight harshness from the alcohol, which is inevitable if admirably low with 9.5% ABV. 
O: Superb. This finely crafted coffee stout is one of the best examples of the style I have ever tried, better than FBS I think, with an excellent quantity of coffee and balancing sweetness. Highly recommended 1,512 characterschinchill, Feb 17, 2013

A -- Rich dark brown (almost black) pour. Perhaps a finger of head quickly dissipates leaving no head.
S -- Smells great. Sweet with bitter-coffee notes
T -- This is a very complex beer. The initial taste of this beer comes off as too sweet. This however mellows out as it quickly warms on the tongue to allow the coffee to work its way to the top. This beer transforms from good to great in one sip.
M -- Rich velvety feel is perfect for this style
O -- As mentioned above, one of the best imperial coffee stouts out there.. even for $5 per 11.5oz. 603 charactersCee-Poe, Feb 12, 2013

3.66/5  rDev -16.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.75Pours a deep brownish black, fairly translucent body especially around the edges. A few bubbles of head and a thin ring of bubbles around the edges.
Smells like a nice cup of iced coffee with a shot of espresso. Some roast, carmel sweetness and light fruitiness.
Tastes like a lightly carbonated, sweet and chocolatey roasted coffee drink. Some roast blends with coffee and espresso flavors nicely. This has a very off putting metallic note which indicates this one is a bit old or just off. A good bit of carmel and malt sweetness lingers.
Medium bodied, its very neutral and delicate on the palate.
Overall this is a very solid beer. Well made even with the metallic off flavor.
I'm a bit let down tho at a price of $6 for a 12oz bottle. 743 charactersHomebrew35, Feb 11, 2013

From the first pour, I felt this luscious milky brew was going to bring something different to the table. The nose was disappointing to me at first, showing little horse power and not being completely agreeable to me even if it did showcase a fare good amount of complexity with grainy, woody, smoky, gamy notes at the front and chocolate and coffee setting the backdrop. 
At the tongue this beer manifested boldness, with a velvety smooth texture coating my mouth and a taste profile that felt like what I can only describe as a mix of tobacco, wood and cocoa. 
The masters at Dieu Du Ciel definitely achieved something of distinction and quality with this beer proving that this style doesn't have to be an hegemony of bitter coffee/cocoa alcoholic bombs. It's a beer I'm happy i came across but it's just not completely to my taste, unfortunately. 884 charactersendovelico, Jan 31, 2013

O: This is really a great example of this style. Drinkable, balanced, hides the alcohol, not cloyningly sweet as some imperial stouts. Would go well with creamy cheeses, cheese cake, etc. 694 characterspatre_tim, Jan 22, 2013

Pours black with a bare quarter finger of pale tan head. Small streaks of lace. 
Aromas of expresso mocha latte, caramel and a little cocoa. 
Taste is, as expected, a coffee bomb. Strong doses of bitter medium roast coffee with charred malt, dark cocoa, burnt caramel, molasses and a little vanilla. The booze pops up in the finish but is hidden well behind a wall of coffee. 
Medium full creamy body with moderate carbonation. Bitter coffee plants it's self on the tongue for a long lating aftertaste. 
One of the best available imperial coffee stouts. Great balance of coffee flavors. Too bad this one isn't sold in GA or I'd get this on a regular basis while waiting for Wake n Bake's winter release. 831 charactersThickNStout, Jan 18, 2013

Bought this from one of my local bottle shop's vintage offering. Older than I would have liked, will update at some point with a fresh review. Given its a coffee stout, I'd prefer it to be fresh. That being said:
A: Pours a black/brown thick coffee color. A bit of tan head forms on top, slight lacing left on the sides
S - Muted, as to be expected from the age. Roasty malt whiffs, a good amount of chocolate, some coffee still hanging around.
T - smooth chocolate vanilla and coffee, in that order. Really nice blend of flavors. Ultra tasty, the age may have taken out some of the coffee, but the blending of the flavors is excellent.
M - top notch. Medium thickness, low carbonation.
O - really tasty. Would be worth getting a vertical going. 764 charactersBeerandboards, Jan 08, 2013

Poured a dark black color with a light hint of brown around the edges with a one finger mocha colored head that recedes into the beer leaving a thick lacing around the outside of the glass. 
S: Definitely a lot of complexity going on here, the dominant aroma being that of espresso beans and some light vanilla notes. A hint of alcohol is present in the aroma as well.
T: The taste is again dominated by the coffee taste, followed by some creaminess and light malt notes. Not a whole lot else going on here, courtesy of the coffee.
M: Very light and almost silky smooth, different for a heavy stout but goes well with the flavors. 
O: Overall, this is one dang tasty beer. Mostly dominated by the aroma and tastes of coffee with little else. Very tasty, I would get this again (fortunately I've got another in the fridge). 885 charactersDaktyls, Dec 29, 2012

4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Fun story: I've bought this beer a total of 4 times in my life (and luckily it IS getting easier to find), yet every time I get it I never seem to have the chance to review it! Partially because it's yummy, and also partially because I've had it at disadvantageous times for proper reviewing. Suffice to say, my fourth bottle was found today half consumed and left aerating in my fridge! Yikes! There is some element of sin attached with this after all. The first bottle I ever bought mysteriously disappeared from my dorm room fridge - and my roommate had no idea what happened with it! Ok, enough banter! Onto the beer - poured into a chalice from a 12oz bottle.
Pours an extremely dark, brownish tinged color. No light will pass through this thing. The thickened, roasted texture gives me the impression that coffee grounds are floating throughout this thing. Looks charred and hearty overall, in ways that no other coffee stout I know of ever looks. Carbonation rises to the glass in ridiculous ways at first, combined with a 1 finger sized brownish chocolate head, but it dies down into a ring that still adds an element of elegance to the beer, and giving it the impression of being a genuine cross between a stout and a coffee beverage.
The aroma is rather intense, but in one of the best ways possible. There's an initial alcoholic scent, but it's quickly replaced by an utterly mindblowing combo of fresh espresso beans coated with hop zest, chocolate malts, vanilla beans, herbs, and other spices that are too faint to be individually hand picked. Those coffee beans really linger on the nostrils in the best way possible, and everything smells really fresh and splendid overall, especially the roasted malt aromas combined with the slight hoppiness.
The flavor is where everything really hits home, however. There's no way anyone can make a coffee stout quite like Dieu du Ciel does. The malts and near floral hops hit the palate at first, only to be replaced with tons of espresso beans and a roasted dark chocolate finish. The coffee flavors appear to explode on the tongue, often remaining and not even daring to leave anytime after each sip. Imagine having a premier imperial stout, filled with dark, rich malts, flavorful hops, and strong alcoholic properties. Then, imagine chewing on flavorful, fruity espresso beans. Then... Imagine getting those two factors and making a beer out of them. That is THIS beer! Everything goes down smoothly and easily, in a bold, clear finish. There is no astringency to speak of, no alcoholic burn, and especially no bitter notes other than the espresso texture that remains on the tongue rather than at the throat. 
This is pure perfection here in terms of coffee-infused beers. Never had anything like this to date, and while not my to-go style of imperial stouts (I prefer chocolate over coffee), this is still one of the best beers I've ever had, and definitely complex and ambitious as well. Incredible stuff - don't ever pass by the chance to try it. 3,012 charactersmagictacosinus, Dec 28, 2012

I poured this beer into a tulip style glass with a snifter style base. I figured that would be great to hold in the aroma of this stout.
One sniff and I knew I was right about this beer. It smells great. You get a ton of rich coffee smell. I love the way that this espresso smells.
This is a great sipper. I love the richness from this beer. It coats the mouth with the great flavor.
I know that this beer is a little more expensive (in my store sold by the bottle at around $5). I recommend this beer thoroughly. This is an amazing beer. 743 charactersummswimmin, Dec 25, 2012

A- pours as black as night with a one finger brown head that quickly fades, leaving a nice trail of lacing along the glass and some nice wisps of the head on top of the beer
S- tons of dark fruits smash me in the aroma, with a solid backbone of coffee coming through too
T- the coffee taste is very different from most coffee style beers I've had. It tastes freshly ground (despite being a nearly three year old bottle) and is loaded with bitterness. The finish gives me some sweet chocolate that lingers as it goes down. Beautifully balanced, no heat at all
M- medium bodied, on the thicker side. I get almost a silky texture from the beer though, something I really enjoy
O- this is really good. The pricetag can be a bit of a turnoff, but it's an exceptional beer 836 charactersbigfnjoe, Dec 17, 2012

Coffee, charred malt, burnt bitter chocolate, earth, alcohol in the nose. Smells rich.
Big coffee and charred malt up front. Bitterness, some acid, and a hint of sweetness. Alcohol kicks in, and brings the coffee. Astringent alcohol helps the palate along. Some cassis, vanilla, and charred wood. Boozy bite of bitterness in the finish. Wow.
Full bodied, acidic, and tingly carbonation.
One of the last from this brewer to be tried by me (that I can find). Why did I wait? Amazing beer. 688 charactersOtherShoe2, Dec 15, 2012

The mouthfeel it is very silky and smooth and has the perfect amount of thickness to it. The flavour is fantastic, it is the perfect balance of bitter and sweet. It really excites my taste buds and is far from a burden to finish the entire bottle. As a matter of fact I tally up the remaining stock in the fridge as I drink it. A nice flavourful beer and easily in my top three. For 9.5% this beer is remarkably balanced. If you like dark beers this one is a clear winner. 575 charactersspikefoot, Dec 08, 2012

A- Pours a mostly opaque black color with a 1/4 inch light brown head that retains a bit before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and a half sheet of surface foam. Semi-resilient lacing leaves tiny clots behind. 
S- Mocha aroma of dark roasted coffee, caramel and chocolate.  Hint of smoke.
T- Flavor is much more roasty and bitter than the aroma lets on.  Pronounced booze presence as well.  Notes of dark chocolate, espresso and char.  
M- Slightly creamy with medium-low carbonation and a full body.
O- A big, bold coffee stout that has sweetness in the nose but a full-on black coffee flavor.  Good  stuff but it leans too much toward the burnt roastiness for me.  I like my coffee beers a bit more smooth and balanced.  That's what keeps me from giving it a higher score. 856 charactersImmortale25, Dec 03, 2012

Want to try a fresh bottle, just so I can compare the contrast in
Flavors... But this is damn delicious.
M: creamy lush mouthfeel, with lower creamy carbonation, the mouthfeel in this brew is excellent, velvety and delicious... Really makes the flavors in this brew stand out.
O: this is a delicious stout, and deffinatly a sipper, great chocolate and coffe notes, great full bodied creamy mouthfeel, everything I look for in a stout.... Now unjust need to seek out a fresh bottle, to really see the vast character if this beer. 1,405 charactersPeterIngemi, Nov 25, 2012

The label image shows the Garden of Eden serpent who tempts Eve to eat the fruit and just like Eve I succumb to the offer: Peche Mortel cascades dark reddish-brown to give birth to opaque dark brown body capped by a finger thick deep tan bubbly head. 
Roasted grain/malt renders dark chocolate and strong espresso enhanced by actual coffee added, while malt sweetness creates heavy cream impression. There are some esters that take on dark cherries. Fortunately aging hasn't taken away much of the coffee aroma and the alcohol - although noticeable - remains restrained enough.
Dark chocolate and strong coffee transfer to the flavor that gets softened by milky/creamy 
notes given by malt while background provides minor dark fruit tartness. Finish is rather dry 
with endless roastiness. 
Body is almost full, perhaps a bit thinned by aging, with mild carbonation. 
In short, an espresso type coffee dominated Imperial Stout. Being seduced by the serpent was a nice experience I cannot regret (330 ml, Bottled on 07-2009, into tulip). 1,099 characterscrnipeter, Nov 23, 2012

A - Mostly opaque dark brown with a 1-finger dark tan head that fades quickly and leaves nice lacing. 
S - Milk and dark chocolate, sweet roasted grain, coffee. Very nice but not overly strong.
T - Dark chocolate, latte espresso, dark-roasted grain,  char and some smoke.  Dark fruits (plums, figs, raisins) add to the complexity. This tastes great. Finishes with roasted/char and hop bitterness with excellent balancing chocolate and some coffee.
M - Thick body and light carbonation. Deliciously rich and substantial. Coats the mouth like the remnants of a big bite of dark chocolate and a sip of coffee. Creamy.
O - An excellent, quaffable imperial stout. The alcohol is in the background. The coffee is a bit more subdued in this batch than when I rated it in 2012 and it really suits my taste buds. Great stuff. 885 charactersTucquan, Nov 20, 2012

S: I want to wake up every morning and smell this with my breakfast. The deep rich espresso and dark chocolate mingle - and are better off for the combination. We note some hints of alcohol brandy esters and deeply toasted malts suggesting a molasses. The espresso scent isn't that of brewed espresso, but of the fresh roasted beans, dipped in dark chocolate - heaven!
T: Like an espresso, a strong presence on the tongue, acrid, drying and rich suggest tannins and coco. Sweetness is present - but only just enough to hold the bitter at bay. Some alcohol notes reminiscent of brandy, the alcohol vapours linger, encouraging another sip. Some earthly notes in the flavour, maybe a hint of oak, or peat, but it's rounding out the flavour and smoothing the bright tannins
M: Coating every inch of the palate, and only a minor hint of carbonation upfront. At first sip I find this a like thin, but over time it manages to build on itself to an oily feel. The aftertaste is bold and leaves the mouth with brandy-esque vapours.
O: Peche Mortel is a perfect night cap, warming and rich, uncompromising in it's smell & flavour. The brandy notes suggest a luxury and excellence few brews can match. Well worth a long search to find Peche Mortel. 1,461 charactersFondueVoodoo, Nov 17, 2012

The beer pours a very dark brown color, borderline black, light can get through an brighten up the brown color, a thin head appears, half a finger at most, no lacing or any real retention. The aroma is of roasted coffee, toasted malt and bitter dark chocolate, not very explosive or very complex, but the elements are well integrated. The flavors are a bit more enjoyable, but also not very impactful, roasted coffee and dark chocolate lead the way, subtle toasted grains and a touch of dark fruit and a bit of an unpleasant acidity, but again, the flavors are a bit muddled and the balance isn't there, the coffee is the most dominant flavor but kind of gets lost behind the chocolate and dark malt. The body is nice, a bit thin and overly carbonated, but nice and smooth with a good richness. 
Verdict: A good solid stout that highlights the coffee element, certainly enjoyable throughout the drinking experience. I think it's lacking a bit of depth and complexity relative to other stouts on the market, but this is still a fine beer and one I would happily drink again and again. 1,121 characterskevanb, Oct 27, 2012

S: Damn this beer smells fantastic. It actually really reminds me of Founders Breakfast Stout. There is a nice amount of coffee, dark and roasted malt and a strong amount of sweetness. I am also picking up a TINY bit of alcohol.
T: Man this beer tastes absolutely amazing. Tons of sweet malt with a tiny bit of roasted coffee and malt. As the beer lingers it really turns into a sweet chocolate.
M: The body of this is very full and has a good amount of carbonation on the back of the throat and all across the tongue.
O: This is one of the best beers I have ever had. There isnt a single part of this beer that isnt amazing and cant wait to grab a few more bottles. 813 charactersgtermi, Oct 25, 2012

Condensed bc I'm not typing all that again: 
Great beer. Amazing even!
Creamy, so chocolate and coffee forward in the nose. Dark, no, very dark roasted grains. Some slight char in the nose. Excellent. Creamy smell? Yes, makes creamy taste and mouthfeel. Nice tang -from acidity perhaps? More chewy, delicious choc-coffee, hint of booze. 
Do you like FBS and/or Southern Tier Choklat? This is somewhere in between those. However, it is more articulately crafted and balanced than ST's Choklat. 
I want more, and in 4 packs. Now. 593 charactersCheezyBlaster, Oct 15, 2012

Served in a Lucifer goblet.
A - Beautiful espresso color with a thin but beautiful copper head. As I drink it bright amber bubbles hug the walls of the glass.
S - Smells of espresso laced with a malty sweetness hidden somewhere inside.
T - Taste is also of fresh espresso. Nice bitter cacáo notes as well. Classic blend of sweet and bitter.
M - soft and round on the fore-palate leading to a bitterness on the way down that does not overpower.
O - well worth its spot in the BA top 50. Very drinkable and the 9.5% ABV is well masked and feels just right. 626 charactersskotster13, Oct 04, 2012

Burnt sugar and roasty finish with some spicy alcohol. This is the least artificial smelling and tasting coffee stout I have tried. Very natural in every way. Alcohol is beautifully masked.

4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.512oz. bottle poured into my Duvel Tulip. 
Appearance: Dark brown (almost black) with a small ¼” dark tan head that actually hangs around. Lots of sticky lacing.
Smell: Dark chocolate and/or baker’s chocolate with a hint of coffee.
Taste: Rich, dark, chocolate with a nice hint of coffee which pushes the flavor toward mocha. Much more chocolatety sweetness than roasted malt bitterness; however, there is still enough bitterness to provide balance. A delicious flavor which is unique among “coffee” stouts and instantly making itself one of my favorites. The baker’s chocolate tends to linger on the palate at the finish, not in a sticky or cloying way, but more like a pleasant aftertaste.
Mouthfeel: Both smooth and well carbonated.
Overall: Very impressive stout, deep, rich, and bold flavors. A beer that deserves its reputation. 849 charactersBobZ, Oct 01, 2012
4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours a deep black, with a finger of tan head. No light passing through this one.
S: Big dark roast coffee notes up front. Some roasted malt and chocolate follow. Some light vanilla notes are present as well, but dark roast coffee dominates. 
T: The first sip is a punch of toasted malt, coffee and bitter baker's chocolate. The following sips allow the malt to fade and the coffee and chocolate to shine through. There's a bit of residual sweetness that cuts through the roasted coffee nicely.
M: Nicely carbonated, but each sip coats the palate. Not too thick, but also not too thin. A nice sipper for the ABV.
O: This is an excellent beer. Probably the best non barrel aged coffee stout I've ever had. I'd take this over FBS or any of the other standards given the choice. Pick this one up. 800 charactersvonnegut21, Oct 01, 2012

A: Pours a pitch black liquid into the glass. The one finger high head is colored light brown with some nice curtains on the glass. The head dissolves rather quickly leaving lacings on the glass.
S: The smell is dominated by a fresh grinded coffee and dark roasted malts. There are also a very pleasant smell of dry and dark chocolate. I can also find some dark fruits, vanilla, smoked ham, oatmeal and oak flavors. 
T: The taste has a lot of coffee in it. Espresso. Particularly at the end. There are also a lot of dark chocolate, dark fruits, red fruits (cherries, raspberries), oak staves, vanilla and finally some bitter sweet nutty flavor. The aftertaste is bitter with a hint of sour. The alcohol is well hidden for a 9.5 % ABV beer. 
M: It has a medium to full body with medium carbonation. The texture is a bit oily and it feels smooth and very well balanced to drink.
O: All in all a fantastic beer! I A must try. 1,007 characterseriktoyra, Sep 29, 2012
4.12/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 412 oz bottle, allowed to warm a bit before being poured into my Brooklyn Brewery tulip.
Peche Mortel pours jet black. Two fingers of mocha foam quickly fill the glass and threaten to spill out. Head retention is decent, and foam is left in a thick ring at the top of the glass, and fairly spotty below. The nose has a wonderful, potent fresh coffee aroma. It's offset by a subtle, perfectly complementary dark chocolate note. The flavor has that same great coffee presence, but it's a little bit more domineering here. There's still some chocolate, and a light earthy hop note, but the coffee is far and away the center of attention. It's to the point where the beer becomes a little bit one note. The carbonation is nice and subdued, but the body could stand to be just a little bit more rich and full. I find Peche Mortel to be consistently very good, but a step shy of outstanding in most aspects. That considered, it's definitely one of the best coffee stouts available year round. 986 charactersaxeman9182, Sep 28, 2012

Pours a dark opaque black with a light brown two finger head. Excellent head retention and significant splotchy lacing. Strong espresso, dark fruit and roasted malt on the nose. Opens with espresso, rich roasted date, baked black cherry, and charred raisin joined by rich dark chocolate and finishes slightly bitter with strong coffee and slightly bitter earthy hops. The mouthfeel is incredible. Thick, silky, smooth and creamy with a perfect level of carbonation. This is one of the most complex beers and definitely one of the most complex imperial coffee stouts I've had. The coffee is very evident, yet doesn't overwhelm the other rich flavor aspects of this brew. Truly a masterpiece. 749 characterschanokokoro, Sep 27, 2012

Poured from a 341ml. bottle, bottled 04/12.
Appearance: A thick and dark brown body is poured. A (not too) huge light brown head forms and the bottom cascades and reminds me of someone shaking out a sheet for some reason. Spidery lacing merges seamlessly with the head.
Smell: Just popping the cap unleashes the aroma. Freshly grinded coffee mixed with raw coffee beans, a type of buttery chocolate and some nuts.
Taste: First sip is all about the creamy yet robust coffee (think espresso), some nutty chocolate, roasted beans, milky and macadamia nuts.
Mouthfeel: Carbonation could be a tad lower but that's just a quibble. Starts velvety and smooth but the coffee bitterness creeps up midway and asserts itself right through the finish.
Overall: This one never disappoints. One of my all-time favorite beers (if not THE favorite). 920 characterspapat444, Sep 16, 2012

A: Slightly opaque black body. Barley any head, caramel color that dissipates very quickly. Decent amount of lacing sticking to the glass on this one
S: Sweet toasty malt goodness with intense coffee burst following. Bits of dark chocolate and vanilla in there. Reminds me of Kahlua, very coffee heavy. 
T: Similar to it's smell. A nice balance of bittering hops and bitter-sweet coffee notes all the way down. Semi-sweet chocolate and vanilla caramel roasted malts. 
M: Not as thick or syrupy as I expected. Good amount of carbonation and smooth which makes for a very drinkable imperial coffee stout. Notes of bitter coffee linger on the palate for a while and makes you look forward to that next complex sip. It's a sipper for sure. 
O: A successful coffee stout from Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel. I'll be seeking out more of their brews. This has a wonderful coffee aroma and taste and I really enjoyed the mouthfeel on this beer. Really drinkable despite the ABV. I'm putting it up on my list with the Speedway Stout. 1,056 charactersGoogs, Sep 15, 2012

T: Smooth roast and coffee paired with dark chocolate and a bit of caramel. Bitterness is quite strong in this beer - the taste lingers in your mouth well after the swallow. As the beer warms, more caramel sweetness comes out. Straight forward, but nice.
M: Medium mouthfeel for the style with creamy carbonation.
O: This beer reminds me a lot of Speedway Stout (but not quite as good). It has a nice roast and caramel flavor with a bit of dark chocolate. I really enjoyed this - my glass was empty in less than 20 minutes. 756 characterscoreyfmcdonald, Sep 12, 2012

Pours pitch black with a dense caramel head with reasonable lacing.
Big coffee aroma. Roasted malt, burnt sugar/toffee smells as well. Really sets the tone.
Full bodied, espresso laden flavor upfront. Coffee dominates initially, fading to a robust roasted malt complexity. Excellent creaminess, but not cloying. Finishes is that of super dark cocoa and rich coffee with cream.
Mouthfeel is perfectly balanced for a beer of this ABV. Not over carbonated, small bubbles. Rich and dense without going too far. Easier to drink than you initially think. 
I've been up and down on the du Ciel beers I've had, but this is genuinely fantastic. 679 charactersBraseltonage, Aug 22, 2012

Aroma is intensely coffee dominated, with roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, and an almost caramel sweetness adding complexity. Hints of dark fruits lurk in the background.
Flavor follows suit, with intense roasted coffee carrying throughout. Chocolate, dark cherries, and rich malt flavors balance fairly well. The coffee flavor is not at all acrid, as I've become accustomed to in inferior coffee stouts. There's a slight nuttiness that emerges as it warms.
Body is fairly thick, smooth, with minimal carbonation. There's a touch of dryness at the finish.
Overall, probably the best straight coffee stout I've experienced. Put this beer in a bourbon barrel, and it would rival bourbon county stout or kbs. 874 charactersbarczar, Aug 07, 2012

A- The beer pours a very soothing hazelnut brown, which is very nice for this type of beer. Makes me feel as if I am sitting down and about to enjoy a nice cup of warm coffee. Resembles a very foamy Americano. Very effective look.
S- First whiff that I get is of the alcohol, the scent is very strong and the alcohol does overpower the other smells a good amount. Once I get past the alcohol though, I get some scents of warm chestnuts and hazelnuts. Coffee bean is the next scent, not all that subtle, but the alcohol does really overpower everything.
T- First taste is something like burnt chestnut and hazelnut, the darker grittier taste must be brought out by the coffee bean. Dark chocolate is the next taste I get and very strongly. Later, towards the very end of the tasting, I get a strong mocha coffee flavor. Alcohol is present strongly throughout the whole thing, but it works so well with everything else that it almost resembles an irish creme coffee. Highly evolving flavors. I still think that the Aphrodisiaque stout is the better beer. But this is a quality brew regardless. 
M- Silky smooth and very syrupy but not in a bad way. The texture of the beer is thick, almost making it somewhat chewable. Very effective, makes you feel like you are eating a chocolate covered coffee bean. 
Overall, very good brew and probably one of the best Dieu Du Ciel has on offer, but the Aphrodisiaque stout is better. Hope I can find this again after I leave Canada. 1,501 characterssennin, Aug 06, 2012

A- Pours a completely opaque dark black with about a finger of creamy slightly bubbly mocha head that leaves some spotty mocha lacing that coats the side of the glass. Head has decent retention and slowly fades to a thin layer of creamy mocha. Looks very appealing, probably the best looking coffee stout I've encountered.
S- Coffee, some roasted malts, some light hazelnuts, some light cream. Very appealing and aromatic, definitely above average aroma strength, the coffee definitely comes out as the most dominant smell but is also balanced well with the other smells.
T- Strong coffee, a little bit of hazelnuts, a little bit of cream, some roasted malts, a hint of dark fruits in the background, finishes with a slightly bitter, strong hazlenut coffee taste that lingers for awhile.
M- Very creamy, but not overly so and definitely not syrupy, medium bodied, just the right amount of carbonation for a coffee stout, drinks very easily.
O- This was a great coffee stout, definitely one of the best ones I've had- the only one that maybe beats it is BCBCS. The strong coffee taste/aroma was great, the beer was easily drinkable, and had a great feel to it. Although it was a little bit pricey, I definitely recommend seeking this one out.
I tried a '10 Peche Mortel (aged 2 years) at a tasting a week or two ago. Compared to it fresh, it lost most of it's coffee taste but definitely had a little bit more dark fruits that came out which were mostly hidden in the fresh version. I definitely liked the fresh version better, but the aged one wasn't bad. I'd recommend trying it fresh, but if you want to try something a little bit different you can definitely age it. 1,720 charactersjaasen64, Aug 01, 2012

A. Black, black, black, as all the stouts are. Half finger of light tan head with some good spotty lacing. Stark contrast between the beer and the head...piercing, even. Good stuff.
S. With damn near a year on it, this one still offers up waves of freshly roasted coffee, lightly singed chocolate crumbles, vanilla, caramel, and some leather.
T. Rich, decadent baking chocolate with lots of residual sugar, but then this roasted, dry whole bean coffee flavor takes hold and keeps the sweetness at bay. It all resolves into a perfect mocha balance. Excellent.
M. A little aggressively carbonated for style. Otherwise it is full bodied and luxurious, smooth and tasty. Integration and balance are very very good.
O. This gives Founders Breakfast Stout a run for its money, and I actually think I prefer the Peche Mortel. Near-perfect from start to finish, make sure you try this beer if you have the opportunity. 941 characterssiege06nd, Jul 15, 2012

Pours an ominous pitch black with a slight edge of ruby clarity. Creamy half finger of light brown head is produced by a gentle pour. 
Fudge brownie, faded coffee presence, chocolate syrup, dry cocoa, various burnt malt in the background. Nice and soft, subdued on the nose.
Delicious. More of that fudge brownie right in the front. Some bitter coffee and faint hops are tied together on the finish. No discernible alcohol presence, a really satisfying drink. A perfect dessert beer I think.
Creamy and smooth. Very grateful to have had the chance to try this one! 634 charactersyamar68, Jul 15, 2012

4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had the pleasure of trying this beer at the brewery, straight from the tap, during a recent trip to Montreal. Brewery Dieu du Ciel! is without question a hallowed name there, well known to any beer drinker worth his malt. But its beer is well worth the hype, and Peche Mortel proves it. 
An inch of luscious, tan foam sits thick atop this opaque brew served to me in a tulip glass. The scent of coffee and dark, roasted malts comes up at me--that sweet and smoky aroma typical of strong coffee stouts--with just a hint of vanilla and chocolate. The smell alone is enough to perk you up. Sipping this beer, the first thing that stands out to me is its texture: thick, but velvety smooth and remarkably drinkable. Its taste is blissfully complex. Without dominating, the espresso flavor comes on strong, a back-of-the-mouth bitterness balanced nicely by the chocolatey, roasted flavor of the malt, a taste that lingers conspicuously on the palate. 
As both a coffee and beer lover, this beer speaks to me in ways others cannot. Dieu du Ciel! isn’t shy about featuring coffee in their brew, and for such a strong one--a whopping 9.5%--they deliver a remarkably drinkable product. Peche Mortel is not a beer for the faint of heart (mortal sin in French), but for dark beer drinkers like myself, this beer’s bold, complex flavor and silky texture set it apart from other stouts. Hot or cold, rain or shine, Peche Mortel will do you right. 1,441 charactersBlindProphet, Jul 03, 2012

Appearance: Rough jet-black pour produces an inch-thick head which eventually dies down to nothing, leaving no lacing to speak of. Dark and intimidating.
Smell: Acrid black espresso, maybe some chocolate hints. 
Taste: Big, bitter, espresso. Bitter, black coffee aftertaste, again with hints of dark chocolate. At first seems like many other coffee stouts, before revealing a depth that I have never before experienced in a coffee beer. Lingering espresso.
Mouthfeel: Lowish carbonation makes it very creamy. Kinda oily maybe? But it works.
A definite sipper, this is certainly an excellent beer, and a must-try. Sharp coffee bitterness is balanced out excellently by the creamy texture. The 9.5% is only evident once you finish the bottle. 907 charactersmungus, Jun 18, 2012

A: beautiful dark black with slight brown around the edges and a one finger dark khaki head with decent retention. 
S: coffee, sweetness, roasted malt, and some more coffee. 
T: more bitter than I thought, with some hops and some chocolate and roasted malt flavor along with the huge coffee taste. 
M: equal amounts carbonation and thickness, with neither overdone. 
O: solid beer with a fantastic smell. Would have again, no doubt, but wouldn't cellar it. This 2011 version was still excellent, though, so who knows? 561 charactersHolland, Jun 16, 2012

black as the Abyss, coffee mousse head
smells of deep malts, black cherry, Kahlua
tastes like an espresso dessert at a fine dining restaurant, with black cherries and shaved dark chocolate, nice bite from the alcohol. not what I expected from reading the reviews, not as much of a strong coffee/espresso as it is a refined, dare I say dopplebock-ish imperial stout. the mouthfeel is perfect: creamy and complex. 
They should have beers like this at '4/5 Star' Restaurants. I frequent high end, creative restaurants and its surprising how people with lots of money will spend on quality for everything but beer! this would pair well with Tiramisu, Chocolate Mousse Cake. Perfect on it's own. 721 charactersLeoPanna, Jun 02, 2012

Brewed over a year before the date of this tasting; Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel has an unquestionable tick-mark system on the label, noting that it was bottled in April 2011.
A: Pitch black with a wonderfully creamy head, with a tan silkiness that gets to about an inch or so; it shines in the light, like soap bubbles in the sun. Sandy, nearly transparent retention, with lacing of light spottiness.
S: Enormously fragrant, incredible! Cocoa, raisin, plum, cherries jubilee, and tons of caramel taffy rise up as a thick, powdery background of malt, which is quite unique as far as stouts go. The coffee is very distinct, yet mild: subtle roasts, dark fruits, candi syrups, maple syrup, and molasses-rich whiskey scents are mixed in with it. All these notes sweep over the body as a bastion of dry woodiness and complexity, an excellent coffee stout showing.
T: A bitter coffee stout, roasted and rich with coffee and hops: burnt toast, smoked leather, rye spice, pine sap, citrus, and dark chocolate-covered espresso beans. It’s a rich and complex roasted flavor; my favorite. It has a unique sweetness to it, like a yogurt-covered pretzel or a Charleston Chew, with an overall flavor of vanilla bean, baked plums, and oaky toffee liqueur. Bottle-conditioned yeast is a cinnamon-breadiness, peat, and some herbaceous sage. Dry and smoked in the finish, this aftertaste is peppery and bold.
M: This stout’s nothing but milkiness and silky smoothness in feel. Perfectly drinkable, this is a stout of superb texture.
O: One of the world’s greatest coffee stouts, hands down. I can’t even imagine what this would be like fresh, with the fair-trade coffee just busting out of the seams at every opportunity. A year may have been too long to age, but this is a ridiculously good stout even after 13 months; what a beer. 1,971 charactersBarryMFBurton, May 19, 2012
4.6/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Appearance – Pitch black with a small brown head that doesn’t last long. Medium lacing that quickly runs back into the beer.
Smell – Lots of espresso coffee, molasses, and malt. Also, a hint of chocolate and vanilla.  Nice!
Taste – Espresso coffee (but not overly bitter), chocolate milk, molasses, roasted malt, and a light hint of alcohol.
Mouthfeel – Smooth, creamy, and velvety; the 9.5%abv is noticeable, and it leaves a lingering slightly bitter aftertaste.
Drinkability – An excellent, easy drinking stout. 529 charactersFalcon91Wolvrn03, May 18, 2012

M: Very solid here. Good amount of carbonation, not too syrupy, but nice thickness. I get a little bit of alcohol burn but not too overpowering.

pours a deep, very dark brown that borders on black while yielding a finger of tannish/cinnamon toned head that dissipates somewhat quickly but leaves decent lacing.
smells delicious. big, robust coffee aroma with strong notes of chocolate and roasted malts. very impressive; the aroma profile follows through in the taste with lots of coffee, espresso, and dark chocolate. has a bit of a bitter finish, could be the hops. well hidden 9.5% ABV. medium to upper medium body with middling carbonation; creamy. very drinkable.
bottom line: this is a tasty, tasty coffee stout and i'm really enjoying it. that said, IMO it has so much stiff competition within the style that it falls somewhat shy of the accolades generally lavished upon it. well, taste is subjective and all that... still a fantastic beer - would love to try one barrel aged.

Appearance: Pours a moderate dark brown head, decent retention and lots of lacing. Black, a bright flashlight proves this brew to be 100% opaque.
Taste: Wow. Lots of flavor here. The aroma didn't lie. Chocolate and cocoa first, then bittersweet coffee. some interesting flavor from some combination of Munich and brown malts and the citrus and floral hops. Some lactose. Very sweet, but near perfectly balanced by the hops, malt, coffee and alcohol. Starts on the sweet side and finishes just barely bitter.
Mouthfeel: Medium to full body. Mild carbonation lightens it up a bit. Chewy. Oily. The finish is mildly dry. Mild warming sensation. The alcohol is noticeable.
Overall: Very well done. The best Coffee Stout I've had to date. Nicely balanced, very bold, and tons to savor. Trying hard to slowly enjoy this as it's easy to drink. There's just so much to savor here.

4.6/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Péché Mortel pours black into the glass with a small, creamy brown head on top. As the foam disappears a few spots of lace cling to the glass.
The aroma is rich with notes of chocolate, coffee, dark fruit and a touch of vanilla. Some roast malt and alcohol are also present. The chocolate and vanilla become more prominent as the beer warms.
Each sip of this full bodied beer is creamy with soft effervescent carbonation. The full flavor begins sweet with coffee, chocolate and vanilla. In the middle dark fruit (cherry) and some oak are present. It finishes bitter with some heat from alcohol. Once gone the coffee, chocolate and cherry lingers on the palate.
A friend brought me back a fresh bottle from a recent trip to Canada. This has always been one of my favorite stouts and I'm surprised I haven't reviewed it sooner. 830 charactersWanderingFool, May 07, 2012

A - As expected, this RIS is thick and dark. Jet black in the glass with a big, frothy, dark tan head. Not quite as dark looking as I had anticipated, but still a treat to look at. The head settles down a bit, but stays thick and frothy. A sticky sheet of lacing coats the glass beautifully.
S - Mild roasted malt base, but not quite the coffee presence I was expecting. There's a pronounced sweetness here too, sort of creamy/milky with some dark chocolate and dark fruits in it; cherries mainly. As it warms I get some espresso, anise, and vanilla notes as well. Not as big on the nose as past imperial stouts I've tried, but definitely a delicious aroma.
T - Starts out sweet with chocolate and cream upfront with a touch of vanilla. Finishes with big roastiness while hints of dark fruits linger. Then, just when it tastes like the flavor profile is done all it can, the coffee hits. Big espresso character takes over the aftertaste that bites with just the right amount of bitterness. Alcohol warmth is detectable, but doesn't hurt the profile one bit. Anise, coffee grounds, and molasses increase as it warms.
M - Incredibly thick. Likely the biggest and fullest bodied beer I've had to date. The carbonation is surprisingly low, but the body doesn't feel too hot or flat. Just unrelentingly thick and chewy, getting more and more sticky as it goes down. I wouldn't describe this as a vicious, brutal, and highly astringent brew by any means, it really packs just the right amount of strength to give it some bite but remain highly drinkable.
D - An absolutely fantastic Canadian imperial stout. Crafted remarkably well in all departments, with the fantastic head and lacing, the rather unique aroma, the delicious and highly drinkable flavor profile, and most of all, the monstrous mouthfeel this brew packs. It's not hard to see why this is ranked as the top beer in Canada. 1,928 charactersConverge, Apr 30, 2012

Served in a snifter, jet black with a thick, brown head. 
Smell has lots of chocolate, and even more coffee and cocoa, espresso was the dominant aroma. Also could smell vanilla, and some smoke to finish.
Complex flavor profile, with all the same tastes as smells. Coffee was the dominant flavor, but cocoa and chocolate, vanilla, oak barrel, all come through.
Thick and creamy mouthfeel, smooth and not too sweet or cloying. Flavors hid the alcohol, you might think it was a bit higher, but not double strength of an average beer.
Well worthy of its World Class designation.
Very comparable to Aphrodisiac

Pour is pitch black with no head whatsoever. It smells kind of weak. Hints of coffee and roasted malt. The taste follows suit exactly. A bit weak for my tastes. I was expecting this robust thick stout, but what I got was a complex porter. For some reason, alongside the obvious dark malts and coffee, I got vanilla somehow. Everything seems to be so subdued, but I think it was a really old bottle (the notches on the side say 04-2005). 470 charactersVncentLIFE, Apr 23, 2012

This pours deep black with a dark head and lace. On the nose the coffee note tends towards the sort I don't like, reminiscent of Bell's Java Stout rather than something like Bourbon County Coffee. In the mouth this cleans up considerably, with some dark fruit and roast mixing in with the coffee. The finish is long on bitter coffee. The body is large and nice.
Overall, I'm glad to have tried this, but disappointed to find out that the coffee note is of the family I don't care for. 594 charactersEricCioe, Apr 14, 2012

Had never heard of this beer before but was in the mood for a coffee stout. 
The pour is pitch black with two pennies width of head that fades after a couple of minutes. 
As I said, the smell is overwhelmingly roasted coffee as is the taste and mouthfeel. Just really amazing stuff.
Needless to say, this is the best stout I've ever had. It is unbelievably smooth and tastes like you're drinking cold pressed coffee...perhaps spiked with a little something.
 Such a drinkable beer at 9.5% leaves you wanting another as soon as you're done, sadly, I only had one. 656 charactersBeerForHokie, Apr 13, 2012

Pours black with a sheet of dark tan foam and no lace. Smells of chocolate, coffee, molasses and licorice. Smell is sweet, but the coffee remains and helps to balance. A little much licorice for me in the nose. Bitter flavor with coffee and bitter chocolate flavors and a little bit of wood. Flavor is okay. The body is thin, thin, thin; moderate carb and a semi wet finish, which is bitter. This beer does not hold up well IMO. Bitter and thin with a deceptively sweet nose.

A: Pours a deep bark brown and nearly black ale. When I can get hints of light, beer is a perfect brown. 1-2 fingers of latte head dissipates in a minute or so leaving a thin, broken sheet of the same. Nearly sheet like lacing. Good looker.
S: Coffee, and good coffee. Beautiful olive tones over a sweet cocoa, date and fig undertone layer. I don't know how fresh this is, guessing not that fresh as the beer has several price stickers on it. Man, awesome nose.
T: Good roasty flavors. Nearly oaky tones, great licorice flavors, coffee bitterness. Bitter cocoa bean flavors. Good resiny hops characteristics remain in the beers life. Good, not great, but good.
M: Thick, chunky and sticky. Tacks my cheeks to my teeth and has low carbonation. Good feel.
O: well crafted beer, I wish I new the age on this to determine how this might develop further. That takes a large chunk out of the overall category for me. 4.5/4.5/4/4/3.5~4.03 1,599 charactersharrymel, Apr 09, 2012

A: pours a very dark brown like dark chocolate with a finger of fine milk chocolate brown colored head that dissipates relatively rapidly before leaving a ton of extremely fine and thin lacing on the glass
S: deep chocolate and coffee malts, very deep, has a slight spiciness towards the end
T: begins with a nice chocolate malt which is soothing then kicks in a deep and bittering coffee malt note and a slight hop note which combine to linger on the palate long afterwards
M: smooth, think and silky through and through. leaves the mouth feeling very dry afterwards
O: this is an incredibly well rounded imperial stout, the only thing i didnt like so much was the taste which lingered on the palate, it was intensely bittering and stuck around for a long time 783 charactersBigPlay1824, Apr 09, 2012

Served in a snifter
A - It pours very dark brown. It is topped with just a skim of tan head.
S - I get a rich coffee aroma. It smells great, loaded with roasted goodness.
T - The taste has a strong coffee presence. The dark, roasted flavors are perfect for a chilly spring day.
M - Full
O - I can see why this beer is so highly regarded. This is one beer that lives up to the reputation. Wonderful flavors and aromas. 436 charactersbuschbeer, Apr 01, 2012

Pours from a 341ml bottle into a Meantime goblet to a rich black with a very thin brown head that soon thins to a thin film.
Not as strong/an endearing a smell as I had anticipated, definate alcohol nose and a touch of roasted coffee and dark malts, but was expecting a little more!
Taste on the otherhand was excellent!
Sweet espresso coffee, chocolate and hints of vanilla. slightly bitter in the afterstate with chocolate just right and well balanced enough to take the edge off the sweeter coffee flavour. A little dark woodiness in the background.
Mouthfeel was just right, low carbonation and smooth on the palate.
Overall a great imperial stout with a hint of coffee. Will most definately re-visit! 757 charactersRuds, Mar 11, 2012

No bottled on date noticed
Poured into a standard US pint glass
Dark tan to light brown head fades over a minute or two to a thick ring around the glass with some sparse, thin islands of foam capping the top of the body. The fading head leaves spotty lacing, which is renewed or modified with each sip. Body is black or very, very dark brown. Even when held directly to a light, only the barest trace of brown can be made out along the outline of the body. Impossible to see through, but the ring of foam persists throughout, so there must be some constantly percolating upwards.
Primary aromas of coffee grounds, chocolate syrup, roasted malt, and a mild sweetness (more notable as the beer warms). Can also smell a bit of ethanol.
The taste opens with roasted malt sweetness and mild char on the front of the tongue. Mid-palate brings forward an intense coffee surge, combined with notable chocolate and roasted malt flavors. I also get some general spiciness, perhaps a bit of cumin, which is probably due to yeast byproducts and the ethanol in the beer. The taste is generally very well-mixed with an emphasis on coffee that does not outstrip the other elements of the beer. Back of the palate bring in continued coffee and chocolate flavors, but ethanol also becomes apparent. Going down, I'm reminded of a dense coffee brownie with a small chaser of vodka. Aftertaste is of coffee, coffee-like bitterness, and perhaps some dark chocolate.
Body is medium-heavy to heavy, with strong enough carbonation to make this thick beer foam up slightly on the palate. The result is a fairly smooth, pillowy mouthfeel. Ethanol warmth is obvious from the beginning in the nostrils, and it can be felt burning the tongue and back of the throat as well; this is to be expected from a 9.5% ABV imperial stout. Finish is quite dry. 1,862 charactersfalloutsnow, Mar 08, 2012

4.52/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A - Small light brown head rises to the top. Head is built of tiny bubbles, tightly compacted. Brew stands very think (think burnt oil) and pitch black.
S - HUGE vanilla and light coffee, this isn't your espresso stout... Very bready/biscuity. Strong chocolate. Very deep sugars, but not a sugar bomb. Slight licorice and barn funk.
T - Very bitter! Way dark chocolate rises to the tip of my tongue... YUM! Think 87% chocolate bar. The coffee is very subtle and perfectly done. There are some faint fruit undertones too, pineapple stands out. Licorice is detectable, but is not offensive like many other breweries error. The bitterness is perfect, as is the carbonation. No heat at all. There's a slight acidic burn from something... cant quite put my finger on what's causing it... 
O - A wonderful brew! Super glad I got to try this one. Thanks for the killer extra Andyavalanche. I cant imagine a better trader. Highly recommended brew! 942 characterschugalug06, Mar 06, 2012
4.61/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A: Pours midnight black with a finger tall mocha head. The head reduces some but about 50% of it is retained. This beer exhibits significant amounts of lacing.
S: Wonderful smell of freshly ground coffee - the coffee aroma with the hints of bitterness. In the background I also detect roasted malts, dark fruit, and cocoa.
T: Starts with the coffee flavor, followed by roasted malts, dark fruit, and hints of cocoa. Hints of caramel and vanilla in the finish. And finally there is a lingering espresso bitterness that turns to coffee over time.
M: Full bodied with light to moderate amounts of carbonation. This beer feels thick and creamy.
O: This is probably my favorite of all of the coffee stouts that I have had. The flavors of the coffee combined with the espresso bitterness, smooth and creamy flavor, and beautiful aroma make this beer special. This is one of the those beers I always want to have. I have had this beer many times in the past and will have it many times in the future assuming I can continue to find it at bottleshops. Very little presence of alcohol in this beer as well. 1,101 charactersdbrauneis, Mar 03, 2012

4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - Black with ruby edges, coarse carbonation forms a one-finger tan head with nice retention. Obvious alcohol lacing creating nice fingers. 
S - Coffee with substantial fig aromas. Roasted malt and sweetened black coffee. 
T - Black coffee, coffee grounds, some alcohol heat, and a finish of deep raosted malts and fine roasted coffee with cocoa. Fig plays a role here, as a background sweetness to round everything out. Not as intensely-coffee flavored as I'd heard, that fig flavor moves it away considerably from that pure coffee profile. Hints of caramel and even vanilla.
M - Full bodied, thick and a little sticky. Bit of alcohol heat. Carbonation level is very low. 
O - Overall a fine stout, but not quite what I was expecting. I'd heard it was a coffee bomb and while it certainly has a great deal of coffee flavors, they are balanced with a fig flavor that doesn't pair especially well with the coffee. I'd rather have an FBS, since that has brilliant coffee flavors which are better paired with other characteristics. Same goes for Speedway, I prefer that too. Reminiscent of Mephistopheles, but toned down a bit and with a great deal more coffee, of course. 1,174 charactersgreenmonstah, Feb 25, 2012

Bitter chocolate up front on the nose. When swirled a lovely bouquet of mocha and coffee. 
Great flavor. Quite a transition of great stout flavors. But most of all this beer just explodes with amazing bitter chocolate and espresso that leaves an amazing aftertase on the palate. 
Mouthfeel is around medium bodied with medium carbonation. 
I had being looking forward to trying this for quite some time and it did not disappoint at all. A great beer by a brewery that has really impressed me. 583 charactersMrVonzipper, Feb 22, 2012

A - As expected a deep black of a beer with a half inch of dark mocha colored head. Lacing is excellent.
S - Deep smelling I get some strong coffee, roast, and chocolate with molasses and anise. Smells boozy yet balanced.
T - I really love the balanced coffee/roast flavors in this. Rounding this out is some mild coca powder and natural chocolate flavored malts. 
M - Medium to heavy buy slick and creamy. Excellent.
Overall this was worth the money, maybe even a revisit if found around 5 bucks. One world class stout. 588 charactersDrDemento456, Feb 19, 2012

4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bought a 11.5 fl. oz. bottle of this from The Wine & Cheese Place in Clayton, MO for $4.99. Poured from the Dark Red/Gothic looking bottle w/ what looks like Echidna (from Greek Mythology) on the front into my 12oz Schlafly Tulip Glass. Has Lot 4,5 on the side & "this brew was born in our Montreal brewpub in October 2001". Wish this one was that old of a Vintage!
Aroma- The aroma starts off withs tons of coffee beans and dark chocolate. There is a great amount of strength, richness, and light booziness at the finish. All very complexed and within the guidelines of this style. 
Appearance- Pours a 1 finger, dark brown head that dies fairly quick. Has the darkest brown body (opaque) with tons of viscosity. Leaves thick, dark lacing behind. 
Flavor- Very deep attributes starting with malt, chocolate, and coffee. The roast is very dominant until the smooth chocolate comes into play. The coffee is in the background and keeps out of the way of these other two. Light-medium hops are also included and has a Light bitterness level. Awesome! 
Mouthfeel- Medium-Full Bodied, Light Carbonation, Smooth, Slick, and leaves light coffee on the palate. 
Overall Impression- A very deep but never "too intense" type of Stout. I highly recommend ANYONE picking this one up because of its nice character and unlike other stouts, is drinkable. A delicious, Slick, Coffee Infused with Dark Chocolate Imperial Stout. This is what sums this one up! 1,446 charactersDCon, Feb 11, 2012

Visual (4.5): Dark, dark, dark brown with an espresso froth head. The head is extremely creamy looking with tight bubbles that just sit beautifully atop the midnight beer. Perfect lacing coats the interior of the glass.
Aroma (5): Sweet chocolate espresso grind that intermingles with the smell of alcohol. A perfect blend that entices the nose before the beer touches your lips.
Taste (4.5): Roasted coffee malt flavour and the sweetness of dark chocolate. The coffee malt flavour dominates as it should and sticks in the mouth and throat after the swallow. Whatever slight hop they used, is used beautifully as the savoury malt coffee is perfectly balanced with a touch of bitterness at the end.
Mouthfeel (5): In a few words, perfectly fitting. The creamiest beer I've ever had, with a coffee grind roughness that beautifully emulates the style. The thick, chewy body more than anything screams "coffee stout". Strangely enough though, doesn't leave an alcoholic lingering.
Overall (5): Exactly what you would want and expect in an Imperial Coffee stout: stark coffee malt flavour, a touch of dark chocolate, an amazingly creamy mouthfeel and a coffee grind aftertaste all tied up with nice hop balancing, alcoholic touches, and a dark dark body. Couldn't ask for better. 1,355 characterstonyf55, Feb 05, 2012

Aroma is rich with coffee, almost spicy, plenty of cocoa character.
Spicy coffee, incredibly rich, but becoming incredibly bitter for a coffee stout-- the bitterness comes from the beans, not the hops though. Black coffee, basically.
Mouthfeel is sublime-- the standout of this beer maybe. When you swish it in your mouth, it becomes magnificently thick.
This is a good coffee stout, but not worth the price tag. 480 characterszaphodchak, Jan 29, 2012

A- Pours jet black with a finger of creamy coffee colored head.
S- Smells exactly like an iced coffee, some nice creamy dark chocolate in the back.
T- Coffee. I mean loads of it. The coffee flavor tastes most like raw, unroasted beans, which blends with some roasted malt and chocolate flavor. Light milk and vanilla flavors as well. The malt provides a bit of bitter flavor but hop presence is minimal.
M- Medium to full bodied, has a nice smooth creamy feel, carbonation is moderate to light.
O- A really great stout, one of the best coffee flavored stouts I've had, it really packs in the coffee flavor, I think I liked it a bit better from the bottle, but this is still an amazing beer. 730 charactersWillCarrera, Jan 28, 2012

Robust mocha aroma follows in the taste along with layers of milk and dark chocolate. Some hints of candied plum with clean, fresh roasted coffee coming through strong in the finish. Full, hefty body with a low carbonation level makes it velvety smooth across the palate. Some tastes of chocolate milk come out as it warms with the abv staying well hidden.

Appearance: Dark, thick, and still. Head is light tan and dwindles in short order to a thin cap. Spotty lacing. Almost black, but some dark brown sneaks out when held to direct light.
Smell: Roasted malts with some burnt notes. Coffee on the back runs from day old to oily and fresh. It's like sticking your nose in a bag of unground espresso beans. Bitter chocolate and some almost bready malts. Some lingering sweetness. Rich, creamy chocolate and coffee.
Taste: Coffee, roasted malts. Milk chocolate with a touch of burn malt to give it character. Sweetness plays through the back. So very roasted. Coffee is unrelenting, but never overbearing. Lingering alcohol heat mixes with hints of dark fruit and a deep bready malt base.
Mouthfeel: Nice and moderate. Borders on full at times. Touch dry from the alcohol. Smooth as can be.
Overall: A solid take on the coffee-infused stout. Very nice malt profile and a high drinkability. I always keep one of these in the fridge. 1,027 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Jan 27, 2012

T - Starts off with a nice espresso kick slowly giving way to a mix of bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, cherries, and even more dark roast. Very little alcohol initially with a bit more coming through as it warms up. Finish is pretty roasty with a touch of sweetness, lingering on the pallet for some time.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Smooth, roasty feel that lingers on the pallet for some time. 
O - Easily one of the best stouts for your money. Tons of tasty flavors and very little alcohol detectable. The perfect beer for a cold winter night. 903 charactersorangesol, Jan 27, 2012

No nonsense on the aroma. Big espresso and bittersweet chocolate aromas. The finish of the aroma hints at molasses. Really hits the spot for a coffee stout. Dark roasted malts on this with a bitter espresso finish. Hints of rich chocolate on the finish but this is really a coffee bomb. 
The feel is full and robust with soft carbonation.
Overall this is a great on. A good treat for a coffee and beer lover. 551 charactersBendurgin, Jan 26, 2012

Appearance – Pours an opaque black into a tulip. About half a finger of mocha colored head.
Smell – Roasted malts, chocolate, still heavy coffee aromas, vanilla, and slight oak.
Taste – Honestly, a wonderful fresh coffee flavor mixed with chocolate and oak. A nice real vanilla flavor comes in midway and ends with a hint of alcohol and bittersweet cocoa.
Mouthfeel – Medium bodied, good carbonation, finishes a hint dry.
Overall – A damn good coffee stout, and I’d be curious to see how this was fresh. 557 charactersSpdKilz, Jan 25, 2012

4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Two fingers of dense, creamy head is dark chestnut brown over an almost black, opaque beer. The head lasts a long time, eventually forming a blanket after leaving fine lacing. The beer leaves a viscous film on a Dogfish Head pint glass with each sip.
Nose fills with caramelized sugar, molasses, and deep roasted coffee. This develops to reveal pumpernickel bread and a background of bourbon and bittersweet chocolate.
The flavor profile follows the nose spectacularly well, with an emphasis on the bitter roasted malts followed by sweet milk chocolate. With warmth, one finds nuances of nuts and a subtle roasted finish of dried fruit.
This one has a full body akin to creamy milk with a tiny amount of carbonation with a hint of warming alcohol that sneaks up on you. Finishes dry with a sticky residue on the lips. Just fantastic.
Péché mortal would do well with food, on its own, or as an ingredient if you dare. I am enjoying it immensely as a sipper. It develops to be more mellow with time and warmth. 1,014 charactersSLeffler27, Jan 22, 2012

'10 vintage, consumed Jan. '12.
Poured an opaque black with a moderate tan head, decent retention and lacing. Aroma of coffee, cocoa, dark malts, some dark dried fruits. Big coffee/espresso taste, but decently balanced with sweet malts, caramel, dark chocolate, hints of dark fruits, ash, and light indistinct spice. Pretty nice. Full-bodied and quite drinkable. 410 charactersRifugium, Jan 21, 2012

A: Pours an opaque black with 3 fingers of light tan frothy head. Good retention and some lacing.
S: Big roasted coffee notes. The dark fruits, bitter chocolate and warming alcohol work nicely with the coffee flavor. Very nice flavor.
T: Nice blend of coffe and dark fruit up front. Finishes dry with a lingering bitter coffee and chocolate flavor. Some warming alcohol notes as well.
M: Silky smooth with just enough carbonation. Nice bitter feel in the finish and slightly sticky. Very nice!

Pours black with some light getting through; nice retention and decent head/lacing. Lots of intense black coffee up front. I'm sensing something sour, but I can't really put my finger on it. Mixed along, there are touches of milk chocolate and vanilla. The coffee really dominates, it's so rich and bold. There's a nice roasty bitterness that lingers. Mouthfeel is really nice, not too thick, not too thin; right amout of carbonation. This is definitely a special brew.
This is a little pricey, but there's something special about it. Everyone should try this at least once. I'm probably underrating this one.. 648 charactersBB1313, Jan 12, 2012

4.52/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5I think I've had this beer in virtually every format its available - bottle, on-tap, nitro-tap, and cask - yet I've never taken the time to write a review. Date notching indicates an ambiguous 3/4 and a 5. Served in a Darkness glass.
A - A late-rising finger of light mocha foam settles to a thin cap, thick collar, and glass-coating lace. Body is a tick away from black and completely opaque.
S - Nutty roasted coffee beans, baker's chocolate, black cherry, vanilla, touch of molasses. The coffee imparts a lightly acidic and tart note and while it dominates the flavor profile it's far less heavy-handed than most of the coffee beers I've had recently.
T - The taste is rather chocolate-forward, of the lighter, milky, variety. There's some vanilla sweetness, as well as some mildly bitter espresso and roasted and lightly smokey malts in the finish. Not a trace of alcohol here. Not as good as the aroma, but still pretty awesome.
M - This is definitively medium-bodied and seem perhaps a bit thin, even for 9.5%. Carbonation is a tad higher than I prefer from the style, and there's some grittiness to the texture (perhaps from the coffee beans?). No obvious alcohol, other than a mild buzz at the end of 12oz.
D - It's place as best beer in Canada is well deserved. It's a bit pricey in the US but a steal when I'm home in Toronto (when it's available). Looking forward to the bourbon barrel version, although I'm a bit apprehensive about the feel holding up to the barrel aging. 1,489 charactersMasterSki, Jan 11, 2012

A - Pours a jet black color with a decently creamy head of one finger. Retention is decent, especially considering the high abv. A bit underwhelming but generally appealing. 
S - Bold roast coffee, oak, smoke, cream, and a good bit of ethanol on the nose. It's strong and pleasant, if a bit simple. 
T - Perfectly roasted barley foundation, burnt cocoa, decadent mocha coffee and the right amount of cream. It finishes with a sweet alcoholic burn that warms a bit on the way down. It's straightforward, but I enjoy what's there. 
M - Full bodied, silky smooth, and creamy. Nearly ideal. 
D - Extremely high quality and bold flavors make this one a must have, especially if you're a coffee lover. 780 charactersblakelive784, Jan 08, 2012

4.22/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Fairly fresh bottle poured into Duvel tulip right out of the cellar (~55deg.).
A: Very deep brown, bordering on pure black. Head is a rather large and fluffy mocha, which hangs around for a while after some initial settling. Very delicious looking stout.
S: Tons of fresh roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate and that nice imperial stout toasted malt. Minimal sweetness despite the chocolate. My wife says it smells "molasses-ey"
T: Excellent roasted coffee flavors overpower. Very true to a great cup, the coffee is neither bitter or week and watery, with tons of smooth roasty complexity that keeps you coming back. Beyond the coffee is some dark cocoa and a hint of bittering hops.
M: Nice balance, not too thin or viscous. Creamy without being lactic, coats the tongue and hangs around for quite a while. A fair amount of bitterness, reminiscent of dark chocolate.
Overall, this holds up to the hype. It reminds me of an "imperial" version of Surly Coffee Bender, which is a good thing. I am really glad this is available relatively easily in my area, as it is one of the best coffee beers I have had. 1,107 charactersdoucmehu, Jan 08, 2012

A: Pours a two finger head of wonderful cream lacing, great thickness, and excellent retention for the ABV. Colour is a solid black. 
Sm: Coffee, caramel, oak (?), mocha, and some smoke. Maybe some roast. A pretty strong aroma. 
T: Heavy coffee, with some mocha and cream about the climax. Very intricately subtle, if a bit simple. Caramel and light roast are also pleasant. Nicely layered. Its strength is its subtlety. 
Mf: Smooth, wet, silky, velvety, and above all else delightfully creamy. Complements the flavours quite nicely. 
Dr: Extremely drinkable for the ABV, resembling a good cup of mocha coffee. I like it a lot, and it's fairly priced in New York (where the bottle was acquired). I'd like this on-draught (or even nitro-draught).

12.21.14: Revisiting this gem of a beer. Bottled March 2012. Let's see how she drinks at 2.5 years.
Served cold into a Guinness goblet and allowed to warm over the course of consumption.
No bubble show forms as it's poured.
HEAD: 2.5 finger wide luscious khaki colour head. Gorgeously creamy, full, and soft-looking, with fantastic thickness and a great complexion and even consistency. No lacing sticks to the sides of the glass as it recedes. Retention is stunning - easily 15 minutes or more; the head remained to the last sip - what a rarity.
BODY: Opaque ink-black, with no visible yeast or sediment.
Overall, a great looking imperial stout. I have seen richer deeper heads.
AROMA: Decadent coffee with a subtle espresso-like roast, mocha and java aromatics, dark malts, milk chocolate, chocolate malts, and rich cocoa. The coffee is incredibly evocative and anything but one-dimensional, pairing beautifully with the exquisite roasted barley aromatics. It's on the sweeter side for a coffee stout, though, even evoking fudge.
No booze/alcohol, syrup, or burnt notes are present, making this a seemingly very well balanced imperial stout. Aromatic intensity is mild.
Just mouthwatering. Definitely evokes a dessert beer more than say, a breakfast stout.
TASTE/TEXTURE: The creamy flavour of this beer is easily the best of its kind I've ever tasted, and paired with the mocha makes the beer sing. The flavour profile is a teasing push-pull of its silky cream & mocha notes and its drier coarser roasted barley and coffee roast notes. The result is a damn near flawless harmony of flavour with unrivaled depth and balance. Wow.
Carbonation is perfect, and it's aptly smooth and wet. Excellent presence on the palate. One may think the coffee would fade after two and a half years, but it's luxurious - and is complemented beautifully by the sweet milk chocolate notes. The dark malt and chocolate malt foundation never tastes cloying, and ties the beer together into a gooey cohesive gestalt wonder. Incredible flavour depth. Perfect flavour intensity (moderate). The sweetness lingers into the aftertaste, coaxing the drinker into craving the next sip for the roast.
As it warms, still more flavours emerge: chocolate syrup (Hershey's comes to mind), subtle caramel, brownies, still more nuanced chocolatey notes, and marshmallow.
Intricate, subtly executed, nuanced...this is how an imperial coffee stout is done. An there's no booze, yeast, off-notes, or pesky hop character.
Its gooey s'more-like feel is just fantastic.
What a hell of a brew. Why don't I buy this more often?
OVERALL: It's turned into a real treat with age, and I'd say this just about peaks in the 2-3 year window. Easily one of the best coffee imperial stouts on the market, if not one of the best imperial stouts period. I'll definitely need to nab a bottle of the barrel aged variant. It's hard to imagine this much better. Perhaps the best Canadian-brewed beer of all time, and absolutely a must-try in the style.

A: Pours jet black with a huge foamy mocha-colored head that sticks around for quite a while considering the level of alcohol here. Nice lacing.
S: To sum it up in a word, coffee. Also a bit of chocolate and oak notes, but this one really doesn't smell much different from a cup of espresso.
T: Coffee flavors up front followed by some floral, oaky notes and a long black coffee finish. Exactly what you might imagine when you think of a coffee stout.
M: Full-bodied and smooth, but could be just a bit creamier.

A 21 month old bottle that pours just shy of pitch-black. Half inch of creamy head sinks to a thin band. Lacing is solid; still visibly carbonated.
Heavy complex aroma, with roasted malt, booze, strong coffee, bittersweet chocolate and a hint of sourness. The taste is even better; the coffee, which is diminished in the aroma of this somewhat older bottle, is still highly prominent in the taste. Profound and vivid flavor of freshly roasted beans, lots of quality bittersweet chocolate but little sweetness, noticeable but pleasant booziness. Subtle sourness underneath and a touch of vinous, wine-like flavor and a drying finish not unlike a Cabarnet. 
As this sits and warms the bitterness becomes more prominent, as do the sour and drying aspects. Carbonation is on the low side but still has a little life in it. This is not an overly thick or viscous-bodied beer. Slightly sticky but not over the top. 
A very interesting, deep beer with a lot of layers; has a sort of quasi-Belgian vibe to me, combined with the big time coffee hit. Wish I could find this one a bit more often and easily in my neck of the woods and that it was a little more affordable when I do. 1,223 characterstobelerone, Dec 14, 2011

Lots of coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and grassy hops.
The taste follows the nose with some herbal qualities. Not boozy in the taste this nails the coffee perfectly. Bitter on the back end, it also a little smoke and wood.
Full bodied with little carbonation this brew has a nice balnce between grassy bitter hops and coffee malt. It is dry and warm from the booze. It is soft on the palate as it caresses your mouth.
Overall, a top tier brew that I am glad I finally found at the LCBO. Cant believe I walked by the 4 pack all week thinking it was the tail end of their stock of corn du diable. 751 charactersStocean1, Dec 11, 2011

A. Pours a black coffe color with 2 finger tan head that fades rather quickly to leave just a hint of foam around the outer ring.
S. Roasted malts and banana sweetness, yes definitely picking up banana here and vanilla and slight coffee
T. Initial taste was smooth nothingness followed by rich dry roasted flavor and Bitter-sweet coffee, alcohol does not show until the very end.
M. Rich, but a high bubbly carbonation makes this seem lighter then it is.
O. Pretty solid coffee stout, a lot more complex then most but not as easy to come by and on the more expensive side. 612 charactersCentennial, Dec 07, 2011

Appearance: It has a nice fully black color to it. It has a nice thick tan head that dies down slowly and leaves nice lacing.
Smell: The aromas definitly give out hints of alot of coffee, espresso, chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts and a boozey character in the back. 
Taste: Like the aromas, i'm getting the rich coffee flavor, roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla/caramel and a bit of dark fruit. You can bearly notice the alcohol and it has a nice bitterness. Very nice complexity. 
Mouthfeel: It has a low/medium carbonation with a very nice overall balance and feel. 
Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. Glad I still have 3 bottles! 753 charactersSebD, Dec 06, 2011

S - Entirely coffee. Smells like freshly ground beans.
T - Coffee stays the dominant flavor, more as fresh brewed coffee rather than the beans now. A bit of alcohol bite. Backbone is dark roasted malts, no chocolate to speak of which is usually in just about every stout I have tried, especially coffee stouts.
M - Heavy body with heavy carbonation which lightens it up a bit. Almost has a grainy feel to it because of the coffee and roasted malt flavors. There's not too much sweetness in this beer, it's all bitter malts. Aftertaste is slightly dry and bitter with a long-lingering taste of coffee with that gritty feeling you get throughout the entire taste.
O - Delicious, very well balanced coffee stout, also being able to balance it without adding sweetness to the taste was impressive. 921 charactersGarrettMD, Nov 27, 2011

A: SRM is black/dark brown. Head is tan, 1 in, dissipates to top of beer. Medium/light carbonation. Medium lacing.
S: HUGE deep roasted coffee notes and malt with chocolate and slight carmel untertones.
T: COFFEE. Absolutely huge coffee notes. Slightly bittered chocolate and deep roast malt, light nuances of carmel. Alcohol is noticable, but does not detract from the beer. Aftertaste is coffee.
M: Viscous and thick. Full/heavy body. Coffee, roast malt, and chocolate notes blend with medium carbonation to create a mf that is heavy yet pleasing.
O: Phenominal beer. One of the biggest and best coffee beers I have ever had. The use of ingredients definitely showcased the coffee, but everything else was very well incorporated, making a fantastic end product. 810 characterstsauce2, Nov 25, 2011

S= nutty (maybe like walnut?), dark roasted malts, dry chocolate and strong coffee, nice hops florals notes but not west-coast style. Vague hints of brandy at times. Not an overpowering strong nose but very very nice. Maybe vague hints of dark fruits.
T= dry dark chocolate and coffee, roasted dark malts, hints of nutty-ness, a touch of caramel.
M= dry, then slightly creamy after it settles for a while. A slight touch of astringency.
O= a top-shelf beer in its class or any class. 578 characterstherica, Nov 25, 2011

Taste is smooth, decadent dark chocolate, bitter espresso, and swirling hints of vanilla. 
Mouthfeel is dry and smooth, luxurious.

A: Pitch black on the pour. A finger and a half of head settles into nothing very shortly. Lacing is spotty and minimal.
S: Intensely aromatic espresso and coffee roast. Bittersweet dark chocolate. Carob. Slightly nutty. Hints of plum darkfruit. 
T: As in the nose, espresso and coffee flavors hit hard and fast. Deep roasty and nutty coffee flavors build until they reach their apex toward the finish. Roasted malts lend bittersweet dark chocolate tastes that compliment the coffee beautifully. Bitterness and acidity stay fairly modest. Plum darkfruit remains hidden. Kiss of smoke. Long finish of espresso and dark chocolate. 
M: Thick and chewy in texture, large in body but not overly so. It has that creamy whipped texture that one would expect from a latte. Very little in the way of carbonation. 
O: This is a very enjoyable beer from top to bottom, and one of the absolute best coffee beers bar none. Not the most complex of its ilk, but it provides a purely hedonistic drinking experience that's tough to match. This has long been a personal favorite of mine. 1,115 charactersryan1788a5, Nov 21, 2011

Appearance: Jet black and opaque. Pours a thin head that quickly disappears. Leaves no lacing on the side.
Smell: Strong oak and coffee bean aroma mixed with tones of silky semi-sweet chocolate. Subtle raisin aromas as well.
Taste: Very creamy. Semi-sweet or dark chocolate balances the slightly bitter roasted coffee flavors. Warming alcohol is present, but well-balanced by the creamy malt. Finish is dark cocoa and coffee beans.
Mouthfeel: Viscous (oily), full bodied with mild carbonation.
Overall: This is absolutely one of the best imperial stouts that I have had to date. A very balanced, drinkable stout. Alcohol is noticeable, but not an impediment to the flavors or the enjoyment of this beer. Thicker body makes this one more of a meal than a beer for a long night out. I would recommend this one to all. 858 charactersjegross2, Nov 19, 2011

Good retention as head slowly dissipates to a thin blanket then to a ring, where it remains. Lacing is OK for me. Noticeably thick as it pours. 
S: Caramel, dark roasted coffee or even espresso (and plenty of it), dark chocolate, molasses, and some herbal qualities including anise. Wonderful and enticing smell that is certainly coffee bean forward. 
T: Caramel and molasses initially which quickly transitions to that bold roasted dark coffee/espresso flavour with strong hints of bittersweet dark chocolate. Herbal anise flavour follows. Leaves a lingering but not overly annoying bitterness, which compliments the upfront caramel-sweet profile very nicely. Alcohol very well hidden.
M: Full bodied with a medium carbonation. There's an appropriate sticky texture to this that really coats your tongue.
D: An exceptional imperial stout that I would highly recommend. Alcohol will certainly creep up on you. Can't think of a better winter warmer. 1,031 charactersDigimaika2, Nov 17, 2011

3.65/5  rDev -17%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours opaque black, forming a thin khaki head. Pretty good retention, sticky lacing
The aroma is bitter chocolate and dark fruit forward, backed by fresh coffee beans.
The taste is smilar. Coffee is not the main stay, though a lingering bitterness derrivitive of coffee beans rounds out the finish. Bitter chocolate and dark fruit dominate, as in the aroma. Definetly getting some heat in the finish, though the abv is somewhat moderate.
Mouthfeel is about right, pretty damn thick. Carbonation is a solid medium. Overall a good stout, worthy of praise. However, I wasnt as impressed as some reviewers seem to be. 616 characterszoolzoo, Nov 09, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Sipped this one tonight as I watched my Chicago Bears pull out a win over the Eagles on MNF.
The beer appears opaque and near black. A thick beige head hangs out for a few minutes before settling to a thin layer of crema, leaving a nice sheet of lacing in its wake. The aroma brings abundant coffee and chocolates amid a bed of roast and subtle booze. Well balanced, though coffee presence does emerge more than other aspects. Teeming with flavor, roast and dark chocolates are balanced by a delicate bitterness that keeps the sweetness in check. Full bodied with appropriate carbonation. Overall, a terrific stout. Highly recommended. 636 charactersHuhzubendah, Nov 08, 2011
4.28/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4341 mL bottle. Saw this stuff at the LCBO (for the first time) and picked up a 4-pack because I wanted to see what the hype was all about. 
Pours black as night, with one finger of dark tan-coloured head that doesn't last terribly long before thinning out to a spotty cap. Swirling the glass a bit kicks the head back up again easily, though. Lots of stringy lacing on the sides of the glass. Great aroma of roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, molasses, dark fruit and some herbal notes. The ethanol is noticeable but doesn't clash with the other aromas.
There is plenty of roasted coffee bean flavour here to be sure, but the brew is not completely dominated by this facet like some of the other coffee stouts I have had. Beyond the coffee there is plenty of roasted malt and molasses, with notes of figs and raisins. Coffee grinds, ethanol, anise and some citrusy hops give this brew an extremely earthy, bitter, vaguely tobacco-like finish. This earthy flavour lingers on the palate for a while; good balance between this flavour and the sugary, malty sweetness at the front of the sip.
A full-bodied brew, with mild carbonation providing only the slightest of bites. A little chewy/syrupy, moreso as it approaches room temperature. There is definitely some warming from the alcohol, but it goes well with the earthiness, and in general the 9.5% is very well masked here.
An excellent winter sipper - not flawless, but pretty darn close. I am not a big fan of most heavier/imperial stouts, but the balance in this one is so good that even I can appreciate the brew. Seek this one out, it deserves the praise it gets. 1,626 charactersthehyperduck, Nov 07, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A stunning imperial stout.
Pours an inky, oily black which is maintained even when held up to the light. Coffee coloured head and impressive lacing. Aroma of roasted coffee and toasted malts, very complex, including hints of vanilla and even anise.
The taste is robust, well balanced and warming - although the high ABV is frighteningly well hidden until some warmth at the end. Travels across the full palate of roasted and toasted malt nuances, many of which I can’t begin to describe. The coffee is not overwhelming and the hop bitterness yields a delightful finish. 
In my small world, truly a benchmark beer. 618 charactershopsolutely, Nov 07, 2011
3.66/5  rDev -16.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a slick black, with a massive 3 inch dark tan head that sticks around, amazing lacing. Smell is dank roasted coffee, hints of chocolate, and licorice. Taste is all of those things, the roasted coffee is the main attraction for sure. The body is a bit thin, plenty of carbonation, and fairly easy drinking for it's abv. This is good beer, but based on the reviews I really expected more. 425 charactersSawDog505, Nov 06, 2011
4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Got a chance to purchase a bottle after having this on-tap so I was able to compare both. 
Poured into a tulip glass.
A - Poured pitch black with huge mocha colored head that dissipated very slowly leaving a lot of lacing around the glass.
S - Scents of coffee, chocolate and malts just as expected.
T - Definitely different from on-tap version of the same brew. More coffee and dark chocolate bitterness with malt flavor in the background.
M - Full bodied with high carbonation.
O - Still a great stout but tap version is more subtle and balanced. I would highly recommend this bottled version as well. 609 characterstaigor, Nov 04, 2011
3.97/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from 11.5 oz bottle into NB globe glass. 
Pours a nice black color with a modest tan head. Appears to have low carbonation. Light lacing.
Considering that this beer was bought about 5 months ago and I have no idea when it was bottled, I figured the coffee would have faded quite a bit by now. The coffee is very much present. Its also complemented very nicely by some rich milk chocolate and roastiness. Smells slightly sweet. 
Rich coffee up front and some slightly sweet, velvety chocolate. Then a dry, bitter roastiness sweeps in. Hops are not a significant component of this beer. Would have preferred the taste was closer to the aroma. Some warming alcohol too.
Mouthfeel is slightly creamy, nice fuller body, and low carbonation.
Overall, it didn't live up to expectations. Think it would have been better without the dry bitterness in the taste. It was a good overall stout, and the coffee played a very nice complementary role. 947 charactersahq514, Nov 01, 2011

From Bottle into a snifter
Appearance: Dark as a stout should. An aggressive pour made for a one inch off-white head. The bubbles were a combination of small and large this was perhaps due to the bottle conditioning.
Aroma: Tons of roast, and some nice coffee as well. 
Mouthfeel: Medium body, coats the mouth well. 
Taste: Upfront is nothing but roast, coffee and a hint of chocolate. This beer reminds me a lot of a stone IRS.
Overall: I was really happy to get to try this beer. I had seeked it out for a couple of years. It was not as amazing as I imagined but I would like to have it again sometime. 623 charactersChanChan, Oct 31, 2011
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a viscous, brown/black with 1 finger mocha head, dissipates quickly with a decent amount of lacing.
S - Lots of dark fruit, licorice, chocolate with very faint notes of coffee. But actually a lot of that fruit and some of the bitter chocolate and roast.
T - What coffee it lacked in the smell it makes up for in the taste, actually a nice blend of bitter coffee with a nice balance of chocolate and the dark fruit. One of the more fruity coffee stouts I've had, but yet it still finishes with a lot of coffee in the mouth. Very good.
M - Decent carbonation, smooth, not as thick as you would think. 
Overall - An outstanding beer. Balance is superb in this beer, especially with the fruit balancing out the coffee. 728 charactersBeerBuckeye, Oct 29, 2011

opaque black with 1/4" tan head. thin covering of the head stays down to the bottom. araoma - whoa..huge coffee smell, very roasty. 
taste is heavy roasted malt taste typical imperial stout flavors, with lingering aftertaste of espresso. but not overpowering, and a bit acidic. medium body, nice level of carbonation, good balance.

4.41/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the bottle into a large snifter glass. First notch 3, second notch at the 5.
A real nice uniform creamy light coffee like head in terms of color and appearance. Creamy tiny bubbles of the pour, but head gets no bigger than half a finger. Body is classic dark walnut black/brown, somewhat see through but not totally. Spotted lacing around like leopard prints. Looks just great.
What happened to the nose on this thing? Where did it go? Off the bottle there was vanilla, coffee, molasses, even some sense of Brandy, in the glass I am getting next to nothing. Mild coffee sense, faint roast, but not bringing any creaminess. It's good but small. My drink isn't that cold let me tell ya!
Taste though is a nice mix of hop like bitter, kind of mild grapefruit, dried tobacco, and mild roast coffee. WOAH where was all this stuff when I had this on nitro?!?!?! Incredibly diverse palate filled with citrus mild grapefruit first and then char roasting malt. Coffee angle seems to come in on the finish, but hop sense dominates turning the citrus into a dried tobacco feeling even giving some residual grapefruit sugars. Texture has a very noticeable but tiny carbonation tingle, almost like just perfectly muted tonic water. It mixes with the citrus bent giving a tonic water feeling of quinine. It's not velvety but it's fun for the mouthfeel I'll give it that for sure.
I am blown away by the taste on this thing, never had a stout taste this incredibly varied and balanced on top of it. No wonder I can never find this beer everyone probably buys it cause it's just fantastic tasting, which it is. 1,610 characterssmakawhat, Oct 25, 2011

Black on black with an inch-high brown head. Leaves a mess of stick down the glass. Perfect!
Incredibly luscious aroma consisting of coffee, coffee, and coffee, along with lots of pleasant roast, and some sweet and earthy vanilla notes. As the beer warms, a lovely bittersweet chocolate note presents itself. This is incredible!
Earthy vanilla, lots of coffee, tons of roasted malt, and a moderate level of bitterness. I swear this also had a bourbon barrel character as well, but I don't know much about this beer--is it barrel aged? This is a complete, delicious coffee stout. There's no hint of alcohol whatsoever. I'm so glad I finally cracked this one--it's tremendously delicious!
Medium to thick mouthfeel and oh so drinkable!
Perhaps the best, always-available coffee imperial stout on the market (it certainly ranks with Speedway!). This is tremendous beer! Exceptional. 918 charactersehammond1, Oct 25, 2011

4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Jet black. No light shines through this bad boy at all. Poured into an oversized wine glass. produced a one finger coffee-cream head that doesn't want to leave. Swirling the beer easily brings back the head after it goes down a bit. Nice sticky lacing on the swirl, too. An impressive start. Throughout the session a small cap always remains. Lacing is great, and the head quickly reforms after swirling.
Nose: This reminds me of Dogfish Head's World Wide Stout, which worries me a bit because that beer was so over the top on taste that I couldn't finish it. I still enjoy the smell though. It's very boozy. Sweet, rich malt with a definite coffee presence here. A little cocoa and huge crystal malt presence. Dark fruits like plum and fig stand out. 
Taste: Slick and smooth coffee flavor with some cream and caramel. Big lingering coffee bitterness. This kind of tastes like the cuban espressos my brother-in-law makes, which is to say it is freaking delicious. It's more subtle than I thought it would be. It doesn't aim to beat the tongue into submission like some American beers tend to do. There's some rye breadiness in there, too. Just a really smooth sophisticated flavor to this beer. It is just really well done. As it warms, some fruit cake flavors some through. Raisin and bread finished with espresso. Yum! I don't know what I was expecting from this beer, but it wasn't this, and it's very, very refreshing. This beer is a perfect after dinner beer to me. Just replace this with coffee after a big meal, and I am perfectly satisfied. Subtle, sophisticated, balanced, delicious, and very drinkable.
Mouthfeel: This is thinner and more carbonated than any big stout I've ever had, but it is not disappointing in the slightest. It is not syrupy, and honestly I could have another on of these because of the mouthfeel. Moderately carbonated, but definitely more carbonated than most of the style. Delivers the beer exactly as it should, I think.
Overall: This is the last of the big beers that I've been tasting for the past couple weeks. I think I've assaulted my tastebuds enough and I am ready for some less demanding beer for a little while. This was the perfect beer to end with, though. It is definitely a big beer. It's got a lot of flavor, a huge coffee profile, definite alcohol strength, but it just carries it all off with this sense of easy refinement that is very refreshing and inviting. This beer doesn't challenge you to drink it, it welcomes you, and after feeling like I was entering into a boxing ring with a lot of the beers I've tasted recently, this is a welcome experience. I highly reccomend you grab some of this beer. 2,671 charactersetaggie09, Oct 09, 2011

A- The pour is a thick pitch black with a foamy brown head leaving a thin lace after a while.
S- Exquisite blend of espresso, dark chocolate and booze. Roasted coffee and vanilla.
T- Espresso coffee bitterness is the main component of taste. Some dark chocolate bitterness and sweetness also. Yet years from the sweetness of Péché Mortel's little sister, l'Aphrodisiaque.
M- Closer to heavy than medium bodied. Somewhat carbonated. Really drinkable for the high abv.

S- aromas of semi sweet chocolate and fresh brewed REALLY good coffee burst from the glass. A note of cherry cordial blends in the middle. Subtle roasty character with a touch of alchohol and coffee bean on the finish.
T- big roasty flavors right out of the gate. Bakers chocolate, espresso and coffee bean seem to engulf the palate. Agressive bitterness of roasted malt blends with a hint of sweet herb. A noticable alcohol on the finish with a long lasting coffee aftertaste that won't leave. This is one hell of a beer that showcases the coffee with finesse and grace.
MF- oily full mouthfeel with a heavy body and soft carbonation.

A - Pours a completely opaque, deep brown, with about a finger's worth of tan head. Head retains briefly, but retreats to a light coating at the top with a nice line around the edge. Very nice looking.
S - Super coffee up front, roasty malts, and perhaps the most subtle hint of chocolate and vanilla both. Not much of a hop profile to it, but definitely harsh burnt roasted malts. Reminds me of a hazelnut coffee, with a dash of cream in it. Yum.
T - Follows closely from the nose, but with more of a chocolate character. Definitely still very heavy on the roasted malts. Pretty harsh alcohol character, complimented with a light, creamy vanilla backbone. Almost a milk-like flavor. Finish has a hint of cherry, in addition to the very harsh alcohol bite. Leaves a bitter aftertaste thanks to the roasted malt profile. Not quite as good as I remember it being the first couple times. Perhaps it's better super fresh?
M - Harsh alcohol bite, almost the entire way through. Really does not hide the booze well. Also has a milky, thinner body to it. Would prefer it a bit thicker.
O - Overall, this is not quite the beer I remember. I will definitely need to revisit this one when it first hits the shelves. 1,259 charactersMarkIntihar, Sep 28, 2011

Pours very dark coffee brown with a finger of nice, solidly packed dark khaki head which sticks around for awhile and leaves a modicum of lacing. Smells very good: medium roast coffee and chocolate malt, some cola, cashew, and dark dried fruit, with a surprising amount of vanilla bean. Taste is big roasted malt and a lot of coffee, leaving behind a bit of roasted bitterness and coffee aftertaste on a medium length finish. Smooth, medium-low carbonation and medium body. Overall, this is a really solid coffee stout, well balanced and good flavors. I can see putting this in the regular rotation, if I had easy access. Pairs well with dessert in place of coffee. 679 characterspmarlowe, Sep 26, 2011

More alcohol warmth, good chewiness, coffee still largely absent (although I did have this after the excellent Sumatra stout coffee beer). . . some chocolate. Wondered about oats or honey in this. Seemed to be a coffee beer for people who don't like coffee. Simplistic, not aggressive. Did hide the alcohol, which is at a level which could be described as aggressive. A solid beer, but you can get Sierra Nevada stout, an entire 6 pack for about what this costs, and SN to me, is better.
At $6 a 12oz, there's so many better options out there. Thought the same brewery's aphrodite was superior to this one in almost every aspect, if not every. 832 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Sep 22, 2011

Pours an opaque black with a moderate tan-coloured head that gets retained as a thick, frothy collar and leaves a bit of lace.
Very bitter aroma. Roasted malts, chocolate and coffee create a deep body, but the beer also has an odd acetone or chemical smoke-like smell that's a bit off-putting. 
Tastes like roasted malts and chocolate, with a dark fruit--such as plum or date--tone. The coffee flavour really comes through in the finish.
Full-bodied with a carbonated pop on the tongue. Very dry and bitter aftertaste with almost no hint of the ABV. Mild oily sensation on the back of the tongue and throat.
I may have gotten a bottle that either wasn't fresh enough, nor aged enough to be great. The taste is solid, but I can't get past the chemical trait of the aroma. 830 charactersbryehn, Sep 22, 2011

Looks like a perfect imperial stout. Black as night, a small tan head that sticks around in my tulip glass.
Smells insane...in a good way. Coffee aromas big time but also dark malts and a hint of chocolate and even some dark fruit.
Tastes like it smells, times a million. This has to be my favorite beer. I love KBS and FBS, but for me, this is above and beyond. It tastes like the finest coffee and chocolate and a slight dark fruit hint, but it could just be from the coffee itself.
Mouthfeel is perfect. A sipper but I just want to down the whole thing. This is a true dessert beer. Like a kid with really good chocolate milk or hot chocolate, this is what you get when you grow up.
Drinkability? I could drink this daily if it was regularly available to me. For now I will just grab some everytime I see it. 1,023 charactersforcedlaughter, Sep 06, 2011

4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 11.2oz bottle into snifter.
Aroma: Coffee, coffee, and then some. Dark rum, roasted chocolate malt, a touch of vanilla, and some dark vinous fruitiness (compliments of the yeast)
Appearance: Dark black espresso. Tan 1 finger head falls slowly, and leaves foamy lacing.
Flavor: Dark, malty, bold coffee sweetness w/ a bit of pleasant, fruity acidity up front. I'm not used to encountering this kind of acidity in an imperial stout, but it works well in this one, and contributes to the complexity. Smooth, roasty bitterness appears at the end, and lingers for a bit. A touch of alcohol is present in the finish, but not to the point of being "hot".
Mouthfeel: Medium-high CO2 w/ a slight crispness up front, which turns to creaminess. The medium body is definitely lighter than I'd anticipated, but still not bad. The alcohol warms the mouth and throat.
Overall: Definitely one that I'll be seeking out again. The coffee flavor was fantastic in this one! The body was a bit thinner than I'd prefer, but I quickly got over it. All in all, I really enjoyed all of the delicious flavors and aromas that this brew had to offer. 1,139 charactersmdvatab, Sep 01, 2011

T: Big and roasty. Lots of dark roasted coffee and dark chocolate with a huge amount of acidity. For me, the acidity was a little overpowering and didn't allow much else to shine. Still, a pretty great coffee stout. 400 charactersnotchucknorris, Aug 31, 2011
4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to texasclimber for sharing this one. Still confused why they use twist off caps. Poured into a sniffer. 
Appearance: Black with reddish hues when held up to the light. Topped off with a tan head about a finger thick that fades into a thin lacing over the top. 
Aroma: Strong chocolate and coffee notes. Smells like freshly brewed coffee. There is a touch or roasted and smokey grains peaking through the coffee and chocolate. 
Taste: Coffee and chocolate with a hint of vanilla and alcohol. 
Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy with medium carbonation and a slight alcoholic finish. 
Overall: Very impressed as far as coffee stouts go this is easily one of the best I have had and I would definitely recommend hunting one down. 732 charactersjamescain, Aug 29, 2011

Purchased @ Tulleys, Wells, Maine
Price - $7.00/bottle
Péché Mortel (French for "Mortal Sin") 
A mocha colored 1 inch creamy topping covers this black beauty. Almost looks like it's nitrogen infused. When held up to the light one can see along the rim a ruby redness but overall she's very dark and dense. Sticky with plenty of lacing.
The aroma is extremely roasty with coffee beans and dark chocolate. An underlying smokiness is unmistakable and adds to the depth and character. 
The flavor is expresso like with a bitter/sweet finish. Coffee, vanilla, caramel and alcohol are in the forefront. The balance betweeen malt and hops is amazing and perfectly done. 
Mouthfeel starts off smooth and creamy followed by a big wave of bitter/sweetness. Low carbonation with a warming sensation in the finish thanks to the high octane.
Overall this is an excellant representation of a coffee infused imperial stout. More of a sipper and something I'll enjoy in the winter when my bones are chilled. Thumbs up. 1,058 characters05Harley, Aug 27, 2011

S- smell resembles a Cuban coffee (colada)... there's a slight sweetness to the nose above just espresso.
T- Taste represents a slight dark chocolate, with a forefront of everything that makes espresso fantastic. A smokey roasty flavor that hangs on your tastebuds, and doesn't let go. How did they hide the alcohol?!?
M- very creamy full body that plays well against the bitterness of the beer.
O- I was really blown away by this offering. This is everything I want in a coffee stout. This is certainly one of my favorite beers. Dieu du Ceil really knocked one out of the park with this beer. 690 charactersFunkyFibes, Aug 27, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my Great Divide Cervoise Goblet.
A: Pours a wonderful black with very faint dark cherry hues around the edges when held up to light. A light khaki two finger head forms on the pour and slowly subsides into a thin film ring around the glass.
S: A nice bitter coffee bean shines through on the front with some nice light chocolate and some toasted malts. Really blends nicely together.
T: The same bitter coffee hits you on first sip and then quickly mellows out to a wondrous combination of flavors. Light chocolate, semi bitter coffee grinds and a sweet vanilla all mesh together into an amazing combination of flavors. The finish is like dark chocolate melting on the palate.
M: Medium bodied with a light prickly carbonation that feels great the whole way down. The nice sweetness that is left on the palate really compliments the whole beer.
O: I've been enjoying coffee inspired beers a lot more lately and this one is simply great. So well balanced and has a great mouthfeel. I will enjoy this again and again. New goal: find this on draft! 1,082 charactersTreebs, Aug 25, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had this a few times, recently had it again at a coffee stout sampling. Served out of a bottle into a chalice at around 50 degrees.
Appearance: Brownish black pour with a heaping amount of tan head and lacing, with the crown of foam perched soft and billowy on top of the brew for a good minute or two after the pour. Delightful. 
Smell: Definitely a coffee beer, not a beer with coffee, if that makes sense. Big fresh-roasted coffee ground notes, which are really accentuated upon aeration/in the head. The rest of the beer took a minute to find, which the chocolate and roast notes seem to be more beer-like than coffee like, but I could certainly be wrong. There is a slighty pine of hops thrown in there, however, that is very welcomed amongst all the coffee to remind that this, in fact, a beer, and not a cold-press coffee.
Taste: Chocolate java. Rich coffee notes are accompanied by some vanilla, but mainly roast and toasted coffee. I love me some beer with coffee, but the taste here is almost a cautionary tale. Speedway Stout is a perfect example of how to keep your beer tasting like beer while infusing a great deal of coffee flavor. This beer is very tasty, no doubt, but not quite my cup of tea (or coffee) for what I'd want a beer with coffee to shoot for. The sweetness, however, is very nice, i.e. it isn't very sweet. And that is appreciated. Finish is nice as well, with a lingering bit of coffee-chocolate on the tongue.
Mouthfeel: Very nicely carbonated, creamy and not too sweet. Bitterness reminds that there are indeed hops here, which were pretty missed among the coffee in the flavor profile.
Overall: Definitely a tasty beer that is very deserving of its recognition as a very good coffee beer. However, compared to the top shelf of beers with coffee, I prefer the more integrated and duet-like offerings, like Speedway or Beer Geek Breakfast/Brunch. Worth trying, for certain. 1,910 charactersnomomentwasted, Aug 22, 2011

Smell is of roasted coffee beans, dark malt, baking chocolate, tons of espresso, mild vanilla notes that seem slightly oaky at points. Taste is rich with bittersweet notes, roast malt, coffee, some warm alcohol, more coffee in finish and aftertaste with some roast in the finish as well. Med carbonation, full body, silky smooth texture, near perfect feel.

4.07/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 411.5oz bottle poured into a Cantillon wine glass.
A - Pours a dark brown, with flecks of black in the thickest part of the beer. Has a bit of a cola-esque appearance elsewhere. A big, foamy head, almost 3-fingers in height and mocha in color takes its spot as a crown and lingers for a good amount of time. Lots of spattered, thin foam comprises the lacing that covers a lot of the glass.
S - Big coffee notes arise almost immediately and definitely jolt me awake. Bold without being overly roasty, and definitely takes center stage. Not much chocolate here, but there are traces of bitter, dark chocolate. just a big shot of espresso and a bit of alcohol at the end. Focused and to the point.
T - Taste is much like the nose but a bit more astringent. From start to finish, a powerful vein of java shoots throughout the mouth and pumps coffee notes everywhere. It's no secret and it's certainly not subtle, but that is what one would expect from this beer. Much more roasty than in the nose, and again the chocolate backdrop is there to add a bit more dimension. One of the closest beers to an iced coffee for sure, and it does its job well. As in the nose, it finishes with a bit of heat to keep it a bit of a sipper.
M - Mouthfeel is surprisingly lighter-bodied than I would've though with medium carbonation. Not to say it's thin, but it's definitely not syrupy or thick, and even has the texture of a cup of coffee. Finishes slick and leaves an acrid aftertaste.
D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. From a pure coffee standpoint, this beer definitely ranks up in the highest echelon, as from start to finish to aftertaste it brings the roast in spades. In terms of a beer, I highly enjoyed it, but the one-tracked mind of it makes it rough to drink a whole lot of this. A great pick-me-up beer that could substitute for an early pot in the morning if one so inclined. 1,880 charactersnhindian, Aug 16, 2011

A- 2 finger tan head builds up from the bottom of the pour, very nice dark color with a slight glimmer as it leaves the bottle.
S- Cocoa and coffee dominate, seems to lean towards milk chocolate more than dark.
T- Chocolate and coffee balanced, like milk chocolate covered espresso beans, very good, taste definitely leans more towards milk chocolate than most. Very nice.
M- Medium carbonation, dry finish, the taste was the focal point of this beer, the feel did nothing to detract from it.
O- Very nice chocolate and coffee flavor, they nailed the flavor profile, very drinkable, alcohol was just barely noticeable. I like it. 690 charactersFranz4, Aug 13, 2011

A: Pitch black with a creamy mocha 1-finger head. Solid retention and fantastic lacing.
S: Lots of chocolate malt and strong roasted espresso.
T: Mild coffee flavor rounds complements the dark roasted malts. Nice and bitter. Slightly earthy, almost woody. 
M: Very little carbonation. Slight alcohol kick but not offensive at all. Long, strong finish.
O: A great, great beer. I'll admit that I'm not a big stout kind of guy, but I found this to be a tiiiiny bit overrated. Delicious in every way shape and form, but not necessarily world class. Still, as my first coffee stout, I'll give it the benefit of a doubt. A must try. 705 charactersBMoldy, Aug 13, 2011

M: This brew sticks around after its finished and in a good way. It's smooth and delicious.

This is one ridiculously good stout. Received a few bottles of this from a fine gentleman in Nova Scotia. I will be seeking this out at EVERY opportunity. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Guinness pint glass (wide mouth). Poured a thick, 2-3" head that quickly dissipated. This sucker is onyx black. Completely impervious to light penetration. One of the single best smelling beers ever. No joke, I could hold the glass under my nose and just inhale its aroma for minutes on end. Tons of chocolate and bourbon scents, despite the fact its not a bourbon-barreled beer. The most sublime taste. Caramel, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla... This beast is complex. This is so smooth. Doesn't rest heavy on the tongue or coat the inside of your mouth heavily. The taste left behind however is long lasting. You'll still taste this beer long after you've taken your last sip. I recommend this to absolutely all beer drinkers, even if stout isn't your bag. Seriously, if you don't like this, I'm quite certain we can't be friends. 1,240 charactersRetail1LO, Aug 13, 2011

Pours an oily midnight black, small brownish cap forms and little lace is left behind. Aroma full of coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, and vanilla notes. Really nice espresso character, and the coffee blends seamlessly to the deep roasted malt flavor. Vanilla and coffee linger on the palate which is certainly welcome. The 9.5% alcohol is nowhere to be found, always nice. Overall, this is a fine example of an Imperial Coffee Stout. Recommended. 475 charactersStinkypuss, Aug 10, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from an 11.5 oz bottle into a tulip.
Appearance: Peche Mortel pours a dark mahogany, with a bit of a cherry tint as the glass fills up. A small creamy tan cap sits on top. The head quickly fades to a thin film, but there are some nice spots of lace on the glass.
Smell: This has a very balanced aroma. Chocolate, heavily roasted malt, espresso, and cream all blend together wonderfully.
Taste: This taste takes me back to an outside cafe in Milan, sipping on a caffe latte. The flavor is fairly even for a few moments, with chocolate, roasted malt, and some vanilla providing the flavor. All of a sudden, a full burst of espresso and cream burst through, 
Mouthfeel: The body is lighter than I would expect ahead of time for a 9.5% imperial stout, but it is still north of medium. The carbonation is creamy but not that noticeable. The sweetness leaves a light stickiness and the coffee imparts a lightly astringent feel right at the end.

S: At first, a whiff of cherries, plums, and dark berries, which is quickly followed by rich, creamy coffee and caramel, toffee, and vanilla. Almost like a french toast and maple syrup aroma as well. Excellent.
T: Lots of sweet coffee up front, followed by caramel and vanilla that blends into a french toast/bread pudding kind of taste, followed by a woody/oakey, slightly dry finish with just a hint of grassy hops. Amazing.
O: This was one amazing find. I got 3 bottles automatically, and in retrospect, I should've gotten the other 2 without thinking twice. If I see this again, I'll snatch it away like a thief in the night. 680 charactersKrakistophales, Aug 10, 2011

4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4An 11.5 ounce bottle from inlimbo77; again, a big thanks to you Bill! The batch code marks it as Batch 35, but being a US bottle, it lacks on the date coding on the opposite side of the label. In any case, into a Deschutes tulip glass.
Pitch black, even when held directly to the desk lighting, with about a centimeter or so of light brown (or tan) head. It dissipates somewhat quickly, but leaves gobs of lacing behind. Smell is of roasted malt, coffee grounds, a touch of chocolate, and even less plum and raisin. Very minimal sugar is detectable, and the alcohol is completely hidden here. The taste shifts gears a bit. It begins with a sweet, dark fruit flavor, moves into a bit of chocolately, coffee-like center, and finished with a touch of roasty, almost charred malt in the rear. As it warms, some vanilla comes into play as well. No flavor is particularly overpowering, however, and it just seems very well balanced. Alcohol is completley hidden, but along with the carbonation, it's presence seems to help thin the otherwise viscous body quite considerably. Mouth finishes dry and a touch sticky on the roof of the mouth. Overall, a very good stout that I am very happy to have tried. 1,196 characterseclipse54, Aug 09, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Big thanks to g311 for hooking me up with this one!
A: Pours incredibly dark, very oily looking coming out of the bottle. No light passes through it at all. A one finger tan head forms upon pouring, but quickly dissipates to a bit of foam around the rim. Thin lacing around the sides. 
S: Some cocoa and dark chocolate upfront and then a ton espresso and coffee. Overall it is bittersweet with some light hints of cherry. 
T: Opens up with some deep chocolate and a bit of vanilla. There really isnt as much coffee flavor until the finish where you get a bunch of the coffee grounds. It is pretty thick, and I don't like coffee, but this one isnt as coffee heavy as I was expecting. 
M: Medium to full bodied, relatively low carbonation with a nice creamy texture. 
O: A well done beer. I can see why so many people love it, but coffee beers just don't do it for me. I would much rather drink Aphrodisiaque for example. 924 charactersmdaschaf, Aug 09, 2011

*From notes
-- This was purposely served at room temperature --
A: Dark and imposing. This monster is the blackest of rich, dark blacks. No head, no lacing. This is one hardcore cask beer about to be had.
S: Wow - a Costco sized dose of tannic wood and dark roast. The heavy toast here is impeccible. The balance of freshly ground coffee and toasty wood is outstanding.
T: Unsweetened cocoa slaps the palate into submission. As the tounge begins to lay down and take it, in comes the epic, just-brewed black coffee. I take another sip and pull splinters out of my mouth - the wood here is all over this thing like Ike on Tina Turner. Hints of pimento on the back end are unexpected, yet it adds a level of depth and complexity I didn't see coming. This is a nifty and utterly unique brew.
M: I've never had a beer that felt this slick. It's crazy - this is a big time, thick beer that has been conditioned to the point where it feels like satin sheets. I can't imagine ever finding a beer that comes close to resembling the one-of-a-kind mouthfeel of this one.
O: Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel's Péché Mortel on cask is one of the most badass beers I've had in ages. It's also a massive tick for me - I'm thrilled to have finally had this, and on such a momentus occasion at that.
This is such a wonderful beer, but due to it's heavy nature and cask conditioning, one was more then enough. I highly recommend seeking this beer out, and look forward to my next encounter with this dark and brooding Imperial Stout. 1,576 charactersRhettroactive, Aug 07, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap today at Teresa's Next Door. Poured into a 10 oz tulip glass.
Obsidian black in color, this beer comes to me with a creamy espresso-like head with some fine bubbles. This head fades to a thin layer of bubbles that covers the whole surface of the beer, though as I sip, it gets slurped right up. Only a little bit of lace, but honestly, how much lacing do you expect out of an imperial stout?
The aroma is full of bitter coffee and dark chocolate. There are some hints of caramel and sweet, rich vanilla extract. On the palate, the bitterness fades a touch and yields to sweetness, but the coffee counteracts this nicely. The best thing about the flavor is that the coffee character is not fake-tasting. In the finish, I get some of that vanilla from the aroma, which adds a decent amount of depth to this beer.
Peche Mortel has a creamy and silky consistency with a medium to full texture. Very good level of carbonation in this one too, as it is evident, but just a footnote to the overall feel. A bit too sweet in the finish, which knocks the flavor and feel down a little, but this is a great coffee stout. Unfortunate that it's so damn expensive. 1,160 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Aug 06, 2011
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Peche Mortel is an Imperial Stout brewed with coffee, and as some have already suggested, this beer should be enjoyed soon after brewing to preserve the coffee flavors. My bottle is around two months old, and that's only the time it's been in my possession; I haven't a clue when it was brewed. Having said that, the nose on this stout is superb: like extra-strong black coffee with a healthy dose of Irish cream liqueur, suspended over a thick brown sugar and heavy caramel malt base. 
On the tongue, the beer is immediately abrasive--and I mean that in the best way possible--with black coffee, chocolate malt, and what may be black malt. This brew is neither meek nor weak, and what few spaces aren't filled with coffee and malt are crammed with tobacco ash and peat. So strong are the burnt flavors that the brown sugar from the nose is barely locatable, and though I know it has to be strong to even make its presence known, it mostly waves feebly in the background in comparison. Mouthfeel is medium--slightly thicker than 2% milk--and carbonation is medium-light. 
Overall, this is one of the more solid Imperial Stouts I've had, and is the kind of beer I feel I should be eating with a spoon. Fantastic, and definitely not for the faint of heart. 1,256 charactersjondeelee, Aug 06, 2011

I bought it at Wine and Cheese in Williamsburg for $5.99. I broke the top of the bottle when I opened it because I didnt know it was a twist-off. Unacceptable.
Appearance: Opaque black with some reddish highlights. Brown head and several minutes of retention. Spots of lacing.
Smell: Still has surprisingly strong espresso-like notes. There's malty sweetness and some chocolate and caramel peeking through. 
Taste: Wow. If the coffee in this beer is faded, it would be overbearing fresh. Strong dark roast coffee flavors and a bitter, cold black coffee aftertaste. The flavor in the middle displays some of the sweetness and chocolate I smelled, but this thing is coffee all the way.
Mouthfeel: Feels soft and smooth at first, but the finish is harsh and drying in a way that really detracts from the overall beer.
Overall: Possibly the strongest coffee flavor I've found in a beer, and this one may be older than two years. Enjoyable, and with some nice complexity, especially in the smell. Overall though, its a little too coffee-y for me. 1,123 charactersrapidsequence, Aug 03, 2011

Mouthfeel: Low, low carbonation. Mouthfeel somewhat slick, oily and very full, but not the chewiest or most syrupy I've ever had in an imperial stout. 
Overall: Abyss in a 12 oz for me, but way more coffee. Quite delicious, I very much enjoyed it and it deserves its superb ratings. Only gets more interesting as it warms. 829 characterssweetwillyrolbar, Aug 01, 2011

Coffee up front with a light cream dancing around. Light hints of tobacco and a faint anise quality.
Again, burnt (and tasty) coffee up front with a bit of cream following. Huge coffee notes. Finishes with hints of cherry, chocolate, tobacco, and anise. More lingering coffee.
The feel is exquisite. Velvety mousse-like feel
I'm very glad to have tried this beer, probably top 3 coffee beers ever and the smoothest beer I've had in quite some time. 536 charactersRomaniIteDomum, Jul 30, 2011

M- Full bodied. Nice creamy mouthfeel with a fairly clean finish. The abv is disguised very well.
O- Excellent Double coffee stout. Has enough coffee flavor and bitter chocolate that balances the beer very well. Will search this beer out again. 554 characterskawilliams81, Jul 30, 2011

A: Awesome Reverse cascading head to a beautiful tan ring. Nice black hue of course. 
S: Amazing smell with fudge soaked espresso beans and dark charred malts wafting effortlessly from the glass. Some other brighter sweet notes and just a touch of hop resin. Excellent, doesn't get much better than that for coffee stouts. 
T: Outstanding in the taste as well, big notes of fudge, high quality fresh espresso, and then more chocolate and fine coffee. Hops are slightly there but take a backseat though leave a bittering finish with the chocolate and coffee beans. 
M: This is exceptional. Totally creamy and coating, just magnificent to drink. 714 charactersDreadnaught33, Jul 27, 2011
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours pitch black. A vigorous pour yield two fingers of pillowy dark brown head with great retention. Leave a lot of lacing.
S - Coffee and roasted malts dominate the aroma, though there is also a fair amount of chocolate present. 
T - Again coffee dominates along with the roasted malts. The coffee is well done here, no ashy flavors to be found, rich and delicious. There is also a nice shot of hop bitterness to provide some balance. Nice dark chocolate flavors as well.
M - Thick, chewy mouthfeel coats the palate. Coffee and some hop bitterness linger on the tongue.
O - For such a big stout, this drinks very well. Alcohol not really apparent. The coffee intensity may be too much for some, but I think it works really well here. I've wanted to try this for awhile and was not disappointed. 804 characterswarnerry, Jul 25, 2011

A: Pours a pure, darkhearted BLACK. A pour of medium aggression gives it about a finger of a crispy peanut-brittle-colored head.
S: Smells like a big bar of dark chocolate, that's currently melting in a cup of espresso. Great aroma. Sweetness too, like a toffee. 
T: Holy hell, that's coffee. I seriously feel like I'm drinking coffee. Hm, almost feel like I'm chomping on some chocolate covered coffee beans. Some hop bitterness rounds out the taste. Or maybe that's coffee bitterness. Whatever, it's good!
M: Oily and smooth mouthfeel. Little carbonation, but I like the way it sticks.
O: This is a coffee stout, and MAN is it a coffee stout. Just awesome. Glad I've got another sitting in the cellar! 743 charactersCWBlues, Jul 25, 2011

A: Body pours a jet black hue, it a finger head that holds to a silky layer. The tan head is rich in dark color. 
S: The aroma is a rich dose of expresso and chocolate. Medium to high level of intensity for the style. Coffee plays a nice role, while being in the fore front, but not over powering other flavors.
T/M: Rich and sweet balance, of coffee and roasted malts. The bitterness of hops or chocolate smooth off the finish. Mouthfeel is full and viscous, warming and creamy on the finish. Sweet tingle on lingering taste. 
O: This is one he'll of a java stout, not to the point where the coffee influence shadows the other subtle characteristics. Maybe one of the best beers I have had in the style, although it does taste very similar to another beer I have had, but cannot place at the moment. 823 charactersGDBEERMAN, Jul 21, 2011

N: A huge nose wafts up after pouring. Rich coffee, dark chocolate, toffee and vanilla.
T: Espresso, coffee grounds, rich dark chocolate, roasted barley and sweet toffee. Flavors roll around and intermingle creating a more complex experience. Finishes bitter with black coffee, hints of vanilla and perhaps some wood that persists to linger.
M: Medium bodied, soft, creamy and dry.
O: An Imperial Coffee Stout to be reckoned with. The coffee flavors are strong and blend beautifully with the dark chocolate and other flavors. No sign of the 9.5% abv. This makes a great dessert! 689 charactersjustintcoons, Jul 21, 2011

Pours black with a med/large pillowy tan head that leaves a fuzzy lace on the glass.
The aroma is roasted coffee with bittersweet chocolate. 
The flavor is similar with roasted coffee or even espresso being blended with sweet chocolate, dark fruits, and the slightest bit of ash. 
This is smooth drinking from start to finish. The alcohol is only noticable as a warming sensation while drinking, not in the flavor. One of the best coffee stouts I have had. 500 charactersajsdad06, Jul 20, 2011

A: Brown colour with a 5 mm head that fades to a good amount of lacing. 4.5
S: Smells of roasty malt, coffee and some lactic acid. 4
T: There is a dry roasted malt flavour that sits just on the good side of charcoal as well as some woody hops with a slightly bitter kick (this was a fresh bottle). The finish almost tastes very as though it was aged with wood. You'll just notice the alcohol at the end. The bitterness builds as you drink more. 4
M: Dry and reasonably carbonated. The alcohol is noticeable at the end and the beer feels like it evaporates quickly off the tongue. 4 792 charactersvandemonian, Jul 17, 2011

A - Dark, dark, dark black body. Foamy mocha head that gives off some nice lacing.
S - Coffee. Extremely high quality coffee. Faint hints of sweet vanilla, chocolate, and roasted malts. The coffee really does dominate the aroma, which isn't a bad thing at all. This is the best coffee aroma I have ever smelled in a beer before. I could wake up to this every morning...
T - The mouth feel is so silky and smooth. Lots of vanilla, sweet milk chocolate, roasted malts, and that amazing coffee. High abv is noticeable in some warming, but doesn't detract from the beer. 
O - This isn't the best imperial stout I have had. It is the best coffee beer I've had though. Simply world class. 887 charactersdavey101, Jul 13, 2011

4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.511.5oz bottle poured into a pint glass
A: Pours a completely opaque black with 2.5 fingers width of creamed coffee colored head, which has lots of bubbles but still manages to look quiet dense. The head dissipates very slowly down to a thick film that hangs around for the rest of the drink and leaves some, but not much, lacing. The opaque appearance of this beer is impressive, as not a single ray of light gets through any part of the beer. It didn’t look all that viscous during the poor but as it sits in the glass it looks denser than any beer I have ever seen. Almost as if it’s a solid rather than a liquid. 
S: Heavy aroma of not just coffee, but creamed coffee, which is interesting. There is lots of vanilla, along with some milk chocolate, bakers chocolate, and roasted malt. Very nice.
T: The initial sip is just loaded with flavors of gourmet coffee. Early on it taste exactly like strong, bold roast black coffee. After a few sips, a significant roasted malt flavor comes out, with the black coffee mostly being appreciated on the back end of the sips. There are also hints of vanilla and baker's chocolate, although not nearly as significant as in the aroma, with a subtle pleasant bitterness as well. My only complaint would be that it does have a pretty significant alcoholic bite to it at times. The alcohol presence never reaches a dominating level, but it does reach a distracting one, particularly in the middle of the drink. Luckily toward the end, that character becomes more subdued and the beer finished quite strong. 
M/D: Creamy, silky smooth, and warming from the first sip. Medium bodied, with a good low amount of carbonation. As above, the alcohol presence certainly makes itself known. Still, however, for its flavor profile and almost double digit ABV, it is easy to drink. 
O: Overall this is a damn good brew. Imperial stouts aren’t exactly my favorite style, but this is certainly up there as one of, if not THE best one I have ever had. I’ll definitely try this one again, particularly is I ever see it on draft. 2,063 characterszac16125, Jul 06, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Duvel tulip. 
Appearance: Peche Mortel pours a deep and fairly viscous brown-black that lets little to no light in. It's not the thickest looking stout I've had, but it's pretty deep and dark. Atop the beer is a one-and-a-half finger head that recedes quickly to form a foam that doesn't quite cover the entirety of the top of the brew. 
Smell: The nose is just a blast of coffee, and there's not much more to say about it than that. If I strain, I almost find a hint of malts in the background, but the coffee overwhelms any other potential smells. This one gets big ups for boldness, but loses some points for complexity. 
Taste: The taste is also a combination of the big coffee notes and some more subtle dark malts. the coffee is definitely softened up by the malts, however, and there seem to be some sweet, buttermilky tastes lurking in there somewhere. it almost tastes like a touch of creamer has been added to this coffee, which makes this a pretty unique coffee stout. I'm also glad that the coffee is toned down in the taste, though by no means is it subtle. 
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel in this beer is very good. It's certainly not the thickest beer, but what it lacks in body it makes up for in the luxurious, silky mouthfeel. 
Drinkability: This is a very nice drinking beer. There is little to no trace of the alcohol in this brew, which is pushing 10% ABV. Even still, this bottle is going down slowly, probably because of how strong the flavors are. 
Overall, this is a nice coffee stout. It's not the biggest, boldest or most nuanced stout that I've had, but it does a lot of things well, and I would gladly drink it again. 1,681 characterszoso493, Jul 04, 2011

4.17/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 411.5oz bottle poured into a snifter
A: Pours pitch black with about a half inch of tan frothy head that quickly dissipates. Lots of bubbling action on the surface, looks like espresso.
S: Coffee, chocolate, light molasses/caramel, dark roasted malt, some alcohol phenols (dark fruity/hint of rum). 
T: Surprisingly mellow and well balanced. It seems to start warming right as it hits the palate while at the same time the bitterness from the dark roasted malts increases, reaching a climax near the finish. The middle is fairly mellow chocolate with plenty of molasses and rich coffee with a growing bitterness. Finish is warming, quite bitter, with a little alcohol phenols (a little solvent like). A little dark fruit seems to pop up every now and then in the middle to finish. Very rich and creamy. 
M: Fairly full body, low carbonation, silky smooth and creamy with a lot of residual sweetness. Bitter and slow drying finish (starts sweet and slowly dries out to stark espresso bitterness). 
O: A silky smooth and balanced coffee stout that has a weird mellowness to it despite the alcohol being a little hot and having a very espresso bitter finish. Has pretty good depth and complexity, though nothing mind blowing. Overall it's a very good coffee stout, one of the better out there. I don't think it was quite as good as I remembered it on tap though. 1,363 charactersSatchboogie, Jun 29, 2011

A- Pours a thick dark brown from bottle. A thick mocha head forms and fades to leave a light layer of foam and a ring along the edge. Sits very dark in glass, almost black.
S- Lots of a thick dark chocolate cake aroma, some roasted and burnt dark malt. Some creamy coffee and caramel smell. The chocolate cake aroma is really nice.
T- Chocolate, mellow coffee grounds, some soft oaky notes, light warming alcohol & roasty dark malt. The flavors blend together really well. In balance. 
M- Full bodied and flavor forward. Warms on throat a little. Very smooth and mellow. Flavors are medium strength and hold on palate well before slowly fading. Wet through sip. Could be a tad bigger, but nice to have a lighter bodied IS.
O- A very good IS. Quite easy to drink and enjoyable to sip on. Not overly heavy or overpowering. Would like to try on tap if ever available. Sum is better then the parts on this one. Very well done in all aspects. 1,064 charactersbusterthecat, Jun 28, 2011

A: Pours an unsettlingly opaque pitch black; light's inability to penetrate this robust brew leads to no highlights. Massive 3-finger mocha head settles to a rocky foam cap, leaving lacing all over the glass in the process. Gorgeous.
S: Bright espresso, dark-roasted malts and a hint of bourbon. Thick and creamy scent leaps out of the glass.
T: Dark chocolate dominates, followed by bitter espresso and a touch of vanilla. Subtle stone fruits follow. Hops and espresso meld perfectly in order to create a complex, bitter finish in a beer that would otherwise likely be cloyingly sweet.
M: Highly carbonated, thick and viscous. The results a perfectly creamy mouthfeel that makes drinking this feel like silk on the palate.
O: A true treat when it comes around, Peche Mortel is my definition of the perfect coffee stout. Rich and robust; bitter and astringent, yet so far from unpleasant it's not even funny. Despite the high price, this is just too easy to enjoy. 
Absolutely benchmark. 1,087 characterssk8man121, Jun 27, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Peche Mortel, 32-oz growler fill from a firkin/cask at Whole Foods Bowery, part of their new and exciting "Firkin Fridays". 
Appearance: Served in my Sierra snifter, Peche Mortel pours outrageously black and flat, with barely a rim of bubbles and a whitish mantle for a head. Looks very flat and still, opaque and dark, not unlike day-old coffee. Temperature is warm, perfectly cask-y and "natural".
Smell: Sharp booze, gasoline, temperature rising. Some wood, fire, flotsam and jetsam on a remote beach. Coffee. Chocolate, cake. Bourbon! A tad of barnyard, open air and wet fields.
Taste: This is like drinking chocolate milk or cold coffee, plus brown sugar and some creme brulee or dark-chocolate pudding. There is a freshly-ground coffee-bean taste at the end of the sip that is just unique. Roasty, bitter, nice! But very well played, though. This is not like Founders Breakfast Stout, where I felt like the coffee was overtly bitter and not pleasant. Peche Mortel is pretty much all coffee, but nicely done. Also, some whipped-cream, as in a topping for a Starbucks coffee (but better, if you know what I mean). Sugar, fire-booze at the very end. Tongue- and lip-smacking!
Mouthfeel: Perfect cask! Absolutely no carbonation, medium-to-full body and full flavor. Boozy-hot as it goes down, warms the throat and the esophagus nicely. Chewy and big and boozy, this is not a beer to be taken lightly. Hot but cool.
Overall: I was *this* close to finish a 32-oz growler in one quick sitting. I love this beer! Drinks so well, despite being boozy. Beautiful taste and everything else. Had it before on cask at a bar (d.b.a. in Brooklyn) and out of a bottle; firkin growler is my favorite serving, then bar cask. 1,716 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Jun 25, 2011

Anybody looking for a COFFEE stout, look no further! Peche Mortel is by far the strongest coffee smell i have ever come across in a stout so far. The usual black as nite imperial stout pour with very little head to speak of. The smell reminded me of the 2 double espresso i have every morning, i almost asked joey behind the bar for a pack of splenda to put in my coffee.

S: This beer has a strong coffee bean aroma, roasted coffee beans, to be more exact. There is also some cocoa bean scents and a bit of booze coming out as well. 
T: This beer has a HUGE coffee presence. The upfront taste has a major roasted coffee flavor that just punches your palate immediately. Although it has mainly coffee characteristics, there is a smokey flavor as well in the finish and very little booze with maybe the slightest bit of cocoa as well.
M: Medium to full bodied with some tingly carbonation. There is a very strong roasted coffee feel throughout.
D: For a beer labeled as an Imperial Coffee Stout, it really nails it. The beer is exactly as you would expect a coffee stout to taste. Very rich in flavor, easy to drink and smooth. Overall, this is a great beer! 942 charactersmavbrew, Jun 22, 2011

Smell: Dark, bold, and roasty coffee.
Taste: Massive taste of coffee. It is kind of one demensional with the coffee flavor, but its so good and so smooth.

4.92/5  rDev +11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had on tap at Red's Ale House in North Liberty.
A-Poured dark as midnight, kind of a mocha/caramel colored head. It looks like a coffee stout should look
S-fresh roasted coffee...a touch of dark chocolate, but mostly just fresh roasted coffee
T/M- Like its nose. Which is a good thing. A very very good thing. Silky yet thick, sweet yet roasted. Balanced and harmonious. The aftertaste stays with you, but not in a bad way. It is just like a lingering memory of the pure bliss you just drank.
I highly recommend this. 520 charactersbismarksays, Jun 10, 2011

A: Black pour without a very impressive head. Light brown to brown in color and without a lot of lacing.
S: Deep roasted malts and a ton of coffee. Extremely roasty and dark smells with a hint of sweetness.
T: The coffee taste really starts, takes over, and finishes this beer in a phenomenal way. A small amount of roasted malts and chocolate rear their heads, but not in a big way. This is all about the coffee!
MF: Medium bodied, not quite the thickness I was hoping for. Extremely dry throughout and nicely carbonated. Hardly a hint of alcohol.
O: Really had high expectations of this beer, and it sure backed them up. I loved this beer and cannot wait to get more! 741 charactersrusswbeck, Jun 07, 2011

4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured this around 10:00 on a Saturday night as a nightcap (hey, I'm old, whaddyawant?!) into my trusty Sam Smith pint glass....
It comes out of the bottle black, with a head as high as the liquid of variegated brown bubbles, darker close to the surface of the beer, paling tan as it reaches the top. Quite attractive, really.
It smells like coffee. Of course. Chocolate, sure. But coffee is primary, no doubt about it. Surprisingly fresh coffee.
Tastes like coffee, bitter chocolate, roasted meat, Dark Chocolate Raisinets, the mouthfeel silken and bittersweet. After each taste I tried to resist another so as to look forward to the next. 
Overall, this is so very good. It drinks smoothly and dangerously easily for its high ABV. This lives up to the hype, and I look forward to sharing it with others. 805 charactersMandark, Jun 05, 2011

A- Poured jet black into a snifter. Reminds me of black coffee only thicker. Had a 2 finger head that dematerialized before my eyes. Left a ring that stayed throughout consumption.
S- Had a great coffee aroma with some slight dark chocolate and roasted malt as well.
T - Has an initial coffee bite but gives way to the chocolate and malts. Is there even any alcohol in this? I've had beers brewed with coffee before but this one is different. This intrigues me.
M - Medium bodied but not a thick as I'm used to. Very smooth and drinkable.
O - I was kinda bummed that it came in such a small bottle but the flavor definitely makes up for it. This is one of my new favorite coffee brews. I searched high and low for this and finally had a taste...now I'm hooked. 838 charactersDevi0us, Jun 01, 2011

Poured jet black with a finger of dark khaki colored head that almost instantly reduced to a bubbly film.
Smells of rich chocolate, robust coffee, roasted malt, a little bit of bourbon and subtle vanilla. This beer simply smells amazing.
The taste of this beer follows the nose to the T, but the flavors are enhanced. Rich dark chocolate, robust coffee, nicely roasted malt, smooth bourbon and subtle vanilla. Mother F***ing fantastic!
Smooth, like a hot comb on nappy ass hair son!! Excellent carbonation but the body is a little thinner than I was wanting from this beer. It doesn't slow this beer down at all though.
Overall, this beer was rich, smooth, decadent, robust... the list goes on. All of the flavors come together perfectly. A little thin for my taste but the smell, taste and smoothness of this beer makes up for it. Excellent beer. Thanks again JR. Cash money on your part 961 charactersdcloeren, May 31, 2011

A - coffee aroma some touches of dark chocolate and roasted malt then some more coffee, great aroma roasty and robust
T - such a smooth and well rounded arsenal of coffee, roasted malt and hints of dark chocolate to keep it from being simplistic, not a lot of heat or hops, absolute divine finish. everyone on the planet should have their chance at something that tastes this great, whether it be beer, wine or a cigar this is a bucket-list must. 
M - the brews only flaw is it is a little thin, its just a little thin, but still medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Exceptionally smooth this is the epitome of smoothness and such a pleasant finish. its almost aggravating how great this beer finishes and how smooth it moves. 
O - I will be seeking this one out again for sure, one of the best coffee dominant brews i've had and would like to think is out there. highly recommended thanks to rutager for this one and i am at a loss of words. This Beer is King 1,368 charactersJayAre46, May 30, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -5.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.511.2 oz. bottle poured into a snifter.
Appearance - Pours a deep chocolate color. Almost black, but some light passes through edges. A tiny khaki head comes and goes quickly, leaving just a bit of lacing..
Smell - Coffee and coffee. Maybe a hint of booze, but still mostly coffee. There is a roasted malt character in the back.
Taste - Delicious coffee flavor, but it's tough to gather any other flavors because the coffee is so dominant. Much like the smell, there is a hint of the roasted malt and some chocolate, but it's a distant second to the coffee. The bitterness in the finish is more of a coffee bitterness than a beer bitterness.
Mouthfeel - Fairly thin for the style. A little bit boozy and not a lot of carbonation. All of that combines to make it feel just too thin.
Overall - So it's good and I like it, but an A? No. Not that good. Too one dimensional with the coffee and too thin
Edit: Ok, apparently I didn't know what I was talking about when I had this. Prohibition Pig had a 2011 keg on (as of July 2013) and it was incredible. Upping my rating accordingly. 1,084 charactersAlieniloquium, May 29, 2011

341 mL bottle, poured into a snifter at cellar temperature. 
Bottled on: February.2011
Thanks to EnemyWithin for this one!
Appearance- Pours a dark black completely opaque colour with no light penetrating anywhere on this one, average pour yields a nice fluffy one and a half fingers of tan mocha head that quickly dissipates to a nice ring around the glass and a nice bubbly top as well till finish.
Smell- I get a very strong aroma of coffee coming from this one first and foremost, followed by a nice roasted malt smell, almost a burnt aroma. The coffee is definitely the most dominant in this one although you do get a slight hint of dark chocolate thrown in there as well.
Taste- First off this is a very well balanced imperial stout, and definitely rivals that of some of the best stouts that I have tried thus far. Just like the smells, coffee is mainly predominant in this one although you do get a nice balance of the roasted malts and a slight hint of dark chocolate in there as well and a pleasant burnt malty taste in the finish.
Mouthfeel- Medium to Full bodied with above average carbonation for an imperial stout, this one goes down smooth and creamy, very rich on the palate finishing with a nice burnt smokiness. 
Overall- An amazing imperial stout although a little heavy on the coffee flavours at times although it is very well balanced by a perfect amount of roasted malts and a slight hint of dark chocolate. The smells again are of a lot of coffee then the taste comes through almost the same as well but it finishes with this very nice burnt malt smokiness that is very pleasant on the palate. Hides the high ABV very well, I can’t even taste any alcohol in this one what so ever, dangerously easy drinking, smooth, creamy and rich. A definite go to if I could ever find this one again, please bring this back to Ontario! 1,862 charactersRoke87, May 28, 2011

A - Poured into a snifter a dark, black oily pour with a half finger of mocha cream head that leaves excellent, heavy side lacing as well as a great mocha blanket.
S - Roasted malts and chocolate as well as some coffee. Bitter espresso notes, really nice.
T - Oh so heavy on the espresso. Rich, roasty notes and a bitter espresso finish.
M - Nice and creamy, just as a stout should be.
O - This is a really, really good stout. While it was delicious on tap I found the bottle to be just a few hairs better than this. Still, its worth seeking out! 599 charactersrudzud, May 24, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Picked up the other month at the Craft Ale house during the KBS tapping. Poured into a pint glass. 
A- Thick, rocky light brown head forms about 3 fingers, slowly settles down. Leaves faint patches of lacing. The brew is an opaque dark brown. Appropriately looks like coffee.
S- Very heavily roasted malts, and big on the coffee beans. So much roastiness in this. Almost smokey in some instances. These malts are charred, so much so that there seems to be charcoal. 
T- The roast comes into the flavor also. Definitely some premium coffee flavor. Tiny hint of booze and heat on the back end. Somewhat one dimensional but I believe that's what it's trying to do.
M- The mouthfeel is probably the best aspect. Nice soft and creamy with the roast, smokiness felt on the palate. There's a marshmallow softness in this. Body is medium.
O- Overall this is definitely a good coffee forward beer. I liked it and will certainly have again but I don't think this is as great as it's made out to be. Not knocking this beer at all, but it does fall a little one dimensional. 1,067 charactershaazer, May 24, 2011
4.73/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Fantastic. Everything a strong coffee stout should be. Poured slowly into goblet: viscous, very dark brown, with one finger medium brown head that slowly recedes to lacing. Very mild smell of burnt malt.
Tastes of espresso and toasty malts predominate, with more minor burnt, vanilla, and chocolate flavors. Nice, fine carbonation. This stout is indeed heavy on the coffee, but I think it's blended in very naturally and it doesn't seem at all out of place. This is an excellent, complex, and well-balanced stout, and I will certainly buy it again at the first opportunity. 574 charactersILessThan3Brett, May 22, 2011

Poured in my small Westvleteren chalice the beer looks very good, millions of tiny little bubbles making a one and a half finger head. Nice lacing in the glass. Deepblack to darkbrown fluid with the alcohol pretty well hidden. A bit too much coffeenotes for me but a feast to drink. 429 charactersBrabander, May 21, 2011
4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from bottle into tulip glass. Pours intense black with a fluffy dark cream head, a medium to heavy-thickness oily body, and deep black-brown in color. Creamy vanilla, rich, roasted coffee and a powdery cocoa sweetness predominate in the nose. Also, some minor lactic sugars, caramel, dark cereal grains, and light bourbon. The body is very smooth, and all at once both rich and bitter. The coffee aspect of this beer builds throughout, allowing the finish to culminate in a interesting way with a roasted coffee and bitter earth combination. Up front, there’s some creamy lactic sugars and vanilla, then some minor dark fruits. Toffee, light bourbon, and toasted grains as well. The aroma and flavors play well off each other, though I’d like for the aroma to stand out a bit more. This beer was definitely brewed to be savoured. Very good stuff. 857 charactersCuriousMonk, May 17, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.511.5oz bottle into Duvel tulip. Thanks to BA morningthief for picking this up for me (I think I gave him some NEBCO 668 in return, but I don't remember).
Appearance: Free pour yields a two inch, frothy tan head that dissipates very slowly and rockily, leaving a few arches of lacing. Pours black with red highlights and leaves occasional sweeps of lacing.
Smell: Woody roasted notes, slight dark fruit, brown sugar. Potent malt aromas, mild coffee and a hint of herbal hops. With warmth, the smell really opens up, as all these different aspects grow in intensity and balance together beautifully (some softer vanilla notes come out as well). The smell is pushing 5.0 territory. Augments the flavor.
Taste: Follows the nose, but not quite as deep or pleasant. Nice complexity, with the hops, malt, and coffee all prominent. Shortish black coffee aftertaste. High bitterness (works well), with lots of roasty and dark chocolate notes. 
The totality of the flavor works really well. With warmth, the flavor generally stays the same, but most of the different notes (chocolate, roasted malt, herbal hops) begin to taste infused with coffee. Great balance here.
Mouthfeel: Full side of medium bodied. Slightly oily with low carbonation. Mild dryness in finish.
Overall: This is a beer for hardcore stout lovers and hardcore coffee lovers. No coffee ice cream here; just a powerful, roasty, straightforward stout with a strong, flavorful black coffee background. 
All told, I like this beer about 4.0 overall, but I'll give an extra .5 for the aforementioned aspect of "here's a hearty stout with hearty coffee," aspect, the excellent balance, and the uniqueness of the flavor (lots of big stouts run together, in my opinion). Not sure it's worth $6 for an 11.5oz bottle, but it is definitely a great beer. 1,808 charactersPahn, May 15, 2011

Midnight black with a thin tan head. 
Aroma is coffee and chocolate. Some fruity undertones as well. 
Coffee flavors really come out strong but not overpowering. 
So smooth! Some RIS feel thick and heavy, but this one doesn't. Goes down easy until the bottom quarter, then it starts to feel like 9.5%. 
Excellent. Flavors are complex and balanced, makes for the great experience. 419 charactersslimspady, May 15, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Picked this up off a recommendation from a clerk at Lizardville. I have never heard of the brewery but I am always excited to try a new imperial stout. 
I poured the 12oz bottle into a pint glass to find a deep black body with a tan one inch head that left a nice sticky lacing around the glass.
The aroma is dominated by dark chocolate, malts and coffee, everything I would expect out of an imperial stout like this.
The flavor is exceptional you get the chocolate, malts and coffee upfront with the alcohol hitting you in the middle with a nice finish.
The mouth feel was great, the beer was on the heavy side but creamy with a little punch from the carbonation.
Overall a solid imperial stout, I think it works so well because all of the flavors are very balanced and not one dominates the others. I would defiantly pick this one up again in the future. 866 charactersDan3279, May 15, 2011

S: coffee jumping out from across the room. Very roasty. Vanilla and some slight bitter herb notes.
T: cream on the front of the mouth with a hint of caramel, transforms to dark chocolate and coffee bitterness to finish. Kinda woody, and again an herbal hint that I wish I could identify.
M: Very mouthcoating, and somewhat drying, approaching but not actually chalky. Sort of the feeling of a good flourless chocolate cake.
O: Very well balanced coffee stout. The coffee adds a little bitterness and roastiness, but isn't overwhelming. 607 characterskscaldef, May 11, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours an absolute pitch black with a huge 3 inch beige head that fades to a small cap. Very nice rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smells strongly of fresh brewed coffee with some roasted malt and cocoa powder. Coffee is definitely the dominant smell and this is one of the best coffee stouts I have smelled. Taste is of Hershey's chocolate syrup infused with fresh roasted coffee beans. The roasted coffee bitterness is very noticeable after each sip. Mouthfeel is very thick, creamy, and smooth. Very rich and heavy. Overall, this is a fantastic stout with an unbelievable coffee aroma and taste that is just delicious. 638 charactersUCLABrewN84, May 11, 2011

A: Poured as dark as the artist soul on the label, Thin creamy head that dissipated into a thin tan lacing, decent carbonation.
S: Coffee with some deep roasted malt,slight chocolate.
T: The Coffee taste comes on strong but isn't overbearing or overly bitter ,roasty malts,sweet molasses,slight vanilla hints.
O: Overall this hit the spot- I'm a coffee lover and double Imperial Stouts are my favorite style - This beer is a fine example of one .
The coffee and chocolates were blended together

11.5 ounce bottle into a Founders snifter.
A- Pours a very dark brown color with a 1 finger mocha tan colored head that settles down shortly after the pour. Decent lacing.
S- Tons of coffee that melds very well with subtle chocolate notes. There is also a hint or faint roasted malt. A great aroma that I enjoy immensely.
T- Very nice coffee flavor throughout, backed up nicely with chocolate notes and a slight sweetness. Gets a slightly bitter roasted smoke at the end. A very elegantly simple taste.
M- A little on the thin side for me, but has a nice creamy and oily texture that makes it slide down easily. Flavors linger slightly as well. Average carbonation.
O- This is a coffee lover's dream beer, and at 9.5%, it goes down way too easily. A great example the diversity within the Imperial Stout category. 873 charactersJoshVandy, May 11, 2011

Very dark brown in color with a nice tan head. Lacing is holding onto the sides of the glass. 
I love the smell of this beer. Strong coffee with hints of chocolate.
My first sips were right out of the refrigerator and it left a little bit of a sour after taste. Once this warms up is where you really get the coffee and chocolate flavors. Also has a nice alcohol burn as it goes down.
This beer is very smooth and has a light fluffy mouthfeel.
Overall i think this beer is excellent. I've read about it for years and tried it for the first time a couple months ago. Now it's a staple everytime i go to the store.
You must let this beer warm up before or while you are drinking it. The flavors change dramatically!!! 745 charactersPaul68, May 08, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep dark black, absolutely no light coming through on this one. A mocha colored one finger head slowly disspates to a thin cap that cap that doesn't go anywhere, a rather impressive looking stout. 
Huge roasted coffee in the nose with slight chocolate and hint of raisin as well. It tastes delightful with a strong coffee flavor up front really dark roasted coffee flavor almost of espresso, and it's so smooth! Beer is nicely carbonated and the mouthfeel is fantastic smooth and creamy with a slight bitter bite that rounds it out nicely there is slight alcohol taste and hotness but barely detectable. 
At 9.5% this beer is dangerously drinkable I could enjoy several that is for sure. Overall a great beer that is finely crafted. 743 charactersNuggethops, May 07, 2011

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5We pour a brew of oily black. It holds a one finger head of deep brown bubbles, even on a relatively calm pour. The coloring gets darker around the edges, but eventually evens out. It recedes on the quicker side, but is easily reproducible with a swirl. Flecks of lacing appear as the head goes. No sediment is noted, and the carbonation looks to be nearly nonexistent, if not for the head. The aroma is bright with steely, raw coffee beans. Malts are heavily roasted, and take on something similar to charcoal. There is not much sweetness to cut the malts, but a coolness of cream is present. Slight booze is noted, with a swift sting to the nostrils. As we sip huge bitter coffee hits up front. This becomes quickly overwhelmed by the enormously rich roasted malts. There is a slight sugar sweetness, way in the background. As we move through the middle, cleaner but dark and roasty, somewhat caramel malts mark the transition. The bitterness is gone by this point, and we move towards the finish. Here we get our first hints at smokiness, as opposed to the roasted character at the onset of the tasting. Here the faintest hint of limy hop oil appears. Otherwise the finish is clean. The aftertaste breathes with charred, smokey malts, sour coffee bean, and a bit of booze. The body is medium, but surprisingly lighter than expected. The carbonation remains low throughout. With each sip the mouth is met by a creamy beer, with nice froth, but there is a whipped lightness to it that is quite unexpected. The mouth is dried significantly by the dark malts and the coffee. The abv is within range, and the beer drinks easily, but slowly.
Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the mouthfeel. It was quite unique for the style, in the fact that it retained a glorious creaminess and slurpability, but was so airy and light. Many imperial stouts can be overly thick and syrupy, which is nice, but can become overbearing. Here we avoid that altogether, as we were delivered a beer that comes through in all the robust aromas and flavors, but remains highly drinkable and light. 2,087 charactersTheBrewo, Apr 30, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 5A - It pours black and oily, and is capped with a big mocha head. Retention is moderate and some lacing occurs.
S - The nose is just amazing coffee; there is some Imperial/Export Stout underlying, make no mistake, but this one is all about the coffee. This bottle is perhaps over a year old, as well, and coffee additions seem to fade with time, so I imagine this must be downright jitter-inducing when fresh.
T - The coffee used in this brew must be absolutely phenomenal; it is, again, the star of this show. The underlying beer is sublime, suggesting dates, figs, and other dried dark fruit, as well as notes of bitter dark chocolate and a hint of anise.
M - The feel is a bit on the thin side for me, that's all. It is adequately carbonated (softly), and it has a nice silkiness, as well, but is not nearly big enough.
O - This is a stellar beer, a paradigm. 866 charactersktrillionaire, Apr 28, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle stamp is a confusing 2/0. Not sure what that means, but logging it here in case I do find out.
Pours thick and black, with just a hint of brown at the edges, and a pillowy one-finger head medium-tan head. That head takes a long time to recede, leaving nice lacing and a layer of foam on the surface.
Set the glass down next to me, and the aromas are just calling to me from several feet away. It just smells really freaking good. Smooth coffee comes through first, without the bitterness I often encounter in coffee stouts. It's followed by sweet, dark, chocolatey malts, earthy and a bit pungent. Quite full-smelling and very inviting.
Taste has more bitterness than I expected, both on the front end and the back. The coffee tastes a bit burnt, though it could be hop bitterness misleading me. Other than that it's good, with a solid dark malt base and some nice chocolate notes. But after that delicious smell, the taste is a bit of a let-down. Bitterness lingers on the tongue for quite a while.
Mouthfeel is solid. Thick, heavy with medium-low carbonation. As an imperial stout should be.
This is a good, but not great, coffee stout. The malt base doesn't give it as much complexity as some others, and the coffee has a light burnt/bitter flavor to it. But it's still pretty tasty, and well worth drinking. And surprisingly, I don't pick up the alcohol anywhere. 1,379 characterszeledonia, Apr 28, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from bottle into stemless wine glass at cellar temperature.
A) Deep black, head rose quickly then disappeared with little to no lacing.
S) Coffee, and that's about it. Couldn't smell alcohol or other flavorings/hops.
T) Coffee through and through with no alcohol or other bitter intrusions. 
M) Smooth, creamy, well balanced carbonation. 
O) Easily one of the best Coffee stouts I've ever had. I've had this beer several times, and it never wavers from anything but wonderful. 488 charactersJparkanzky, Apr 27, 2011

Awesomely sipper of a beer. Take your time and savor. 393 charactersJayS2629, Apr 27, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I'm reviewing this off notes from Beer U: Stouts at Stone Brewery.
A - Pours a wonderful black with a slight hint of red, with a nice finger of tan head. 
S - This one is a coffee bomb. It aroma is dominated by the smell of coffee with hints of chocolate and smoked malts. 
T - First, I get bitter espresso flavors, the followed by dark chocolate and smoked malts. The aroma gives you a great idea of what this beer is going to taste like. 
M - Thick and almost chewable. The carbonation isn't super high, but just enough to keep a small head on this beer and make it a good drinker even with the heavy body.
O - This is now one of my favorite stouts ever! I only wish I had easier access to this beer. Anyone who loves Imperial Stouts should try this beer. 762 charactersmadpentzer, Apr 23, 2011

A - black as night with a bubbly light brown head that sticks around almost indefinitely. laces the glass beautifully.
S - gorgeous aromas of espresso, malts chocolate and bread. the espresso smell is absolutely perfect and everything else just compliments it so well.
T - amazing malt sweetness hits up front. the espresso comes in right after and sticks around throughout. along with chocolate and the alcohol taste. there are some nice hops too that come in too at the end to round this off well.
M - full bodied with a lot of carbonation. quite nice.
O - what a superb brew. i don't think there is another espresso/coffee stout that could top what dieu du ciel has done here. 720 characterscelticfutblclub, Apr 21, 2011

A: Pours a near jet black with brown head that is already sticking to the sides of the glass. Very little light gets through even when held up to the light.
S: Plenty of coffee and alcohol with chocolate, roasted malts and some burnt sugar. More heat on the nose than I can really enjoy.
T: Like the taste, plenty of coffee, dark malts and sweet caramel. Some alcohol and coffee bitterness blend with the other flavors really nicely. Great balance. A pleasant alcohol warming, not nearly as hot as the nose lead me to believe.
M: Really creamy smooth with a medium body, not quite as thick as I was anticipating. A bit of carbonation provides a slight tingle on my tongue. Sweet from start to finish.
O: Really nice imperial stout with coffee. My only real complaint is the overly strong presence of alcohol in the nose. I would definitely be buying more of these if they were available locally. 980 charactersAzurescens, Apr 20, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Purchased at From The Vine, Columbus, OH, on 4-16-11.
Poured into my Duvel tulip.
A: Pours a used motor oil black, 1 finger tan head settles after a couple minutes into a small ring and some small patches of lacing. Leaves thick, oily legs at each tilt or sip. Nice, but wish the head retention was a little bit better, but for the ABV, it's not bad.
S: Very nice dark chocolate/coffee/espresso/blackberry combo. Some floral and woody hops, and a small flash of a citrus hop as well. Small whiffs of deep roast/burnt malt. Molasses notes too. This has it all for an Imperial Stout.
T: This is, by far, the best IS I've had to date, flavor wise. Deeply roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, earthy/woody hop, smoke, almost bourbon like sweet notes, very little warming alcohol. Blackberry and molasses in the background.
M: Thick, coating, creamy, and smooth. Finish is dry, but not overly so. Carbonation is on the low side, but right for the style.
O: Oh yeah. I've had this as a want for well over a year, and never been able to find it. After having this, I want more.
This is an amazing Imperial Stout, and one that I will do my damnedest to have as often as my pocket and ability to track it down, allows. Fantastic. Highly recommended. 1,243 charactersKeffa, Apr 17, 2011
4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle dated August 2010.
Beer is dark black, with a thick and frothy tan head on top which sticks around for a fair while.
Nose is roasted malt, toffee, coffee and chocolate. Nice, but not remarkably different than many other stouts.
Taste is excellent. Coffee is certainly the most notable flavour, but it is not overdone. Bitter dark chocolate and the roasted malt enter the picture as well. The taste is fairly bitter, especially at the end. The flavours all compliment each other very well. I am not a coffee drinker, but I love the flavour of this beer. The alcohol is incredibly well masked. 
Mouthfeel is fantastic. Nice and thick, and a very nice moderate amount of carbonation. Just like an imperial stout should be.
Overall, a great beer, and an excellent imperial stout. One of the great things about it is the fact that the coffee is notable, but not overpowering. It occupies a prominent place in the mix, but not to the exclusion of other flavours. Very nice. 979 charactersjrenihan, Apr 17, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter. No best by date on the bottle.
A) Pours an opaque black with a finger of tan khaki head that recedes quickly but leaves a lot of lacing as it goes down.
S) Big coffee notes dominate the aroma on top of roasted malts. Faint hints of hops are present. Some nice chocolate undertones mixed in with the coffee.
T) Roasted malts, chocolate and coffee with a big coffee finish. Moderately bitter but bitterness is more of a coffee bitterness than a hop bitterness.
M) Thick, creamy mouthfeel. Not very carbonated. Doesn't leave much of an aftertaste although there is bit of lingering coffee bitterness. 635 charactersgoalie33, Apr 14, 2011

A: Pours a thick black with a half finger of khaki color head. Head dissipates slowly.
S: Lots of coffee and dark chocolate on the nose. A noticeable roasted grain smell.
T: Similar to nose, Lots of coffee taste from the beginning to end. Some burnt grain taste in there as well. 
M: Lots of carbonation with a thick feel. Maybe a little bit creamy feel.
O: Really easy to drink for a 9+ abv beer. If you are a coffee stout person, this is a must try beer. 502 charactersgregshead, Apr 10, 2011

A: Pours opaque and black with brown at the edges. Nice tan/light brown head with tiny bubbles and excellent retention; carbonation appears good. Alcohol legs and splotches of brown head lacing stick to the glass.
S: Nice coffee bitterness with a nice subtle roasted undertone. The coffee is nice and upfront but its not extremely overpowering. There are chocolate/mocha notes underneath, and it smells bitter.
T: Taste follows the smell, the thing that makes this coffee beer unique is I think all of the roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate flavors mesh very well and don't completely overpower the other flavors. The malts and hops are there, and the chocolate gives it a nice light sweetness.
MF: Medium bodied and wet but sticky. A little viscous, with perfect light to medium carbonation.
O: Its the best coffee beer I've had, and its very good. I'd like to find a beer where the coffee takes a little more of an equal footing with the other flavors but this beer is as close as I have come to finding that.
EDIT: Re-reviewed, higher score given. More prominent coffee, excellently brewed and combined within this stout. Aromas and flavors are strong and not acidic. Very good beer. Previous Score: All 4's. 1,285 charactersScotchboy, Apr 09, 2011
3.08/5  rDev -30%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3I have been obsessed with finding the perfect moment to sit down and enjoy this beer. I figured a night on the couch with the love of my life and an expensive bar of chocolate is ideal in every other way, then so it shall be...
Immediately on the nose I get what reminds me of a carmel-mocha-frappacino-er-whatever. Tempting and perfectly paired with a vanilla bean & malted crumble bittersweet chocolate bar, or so I think...
First taste, BAM! Holy booze monster! It's actually overwhelming and as it warms, the nose too, becomes a booze-fest. I also get hints of bubblegum - Juicy Fruit, actually, and banana? Weird.
The mouthfeel is near perfect, creamy, modest carbonation, but that booze & bubblegum!?
So I begin to suspect that this might be an off bottle. Every review I have read about this beer sets it up to be my cup of tea, er coffee beer, actually. In fact, it has rave reviews AND I love this style, LOVE. But, try as I might, I get a little coffee flavor and a lot of booze. Too much. I sip slowly for about an hour then just give up with about 1/4 remaining.
Péché Mortel - it's a mortal sin I had to dump this expensive beer.
I will try this again. I want to believe it's as good as everyone says 1,221 charactersburnheartsMKE, Apr 08, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had it at Spuyten Duyvil in Williamsburg on 4/2/11, where they serve it in a wine glass.
A: Body is black. Dark black. Given the hand-pump, there was a surprisingly full (1-finger) chocolate-brown head on top. Leaves behind good lacing. 
S: The nose smells mainly of coffee, but there's also some cream, chocolate, raisins, molasses and burnt sugar that offset the coffee and provide some balance. It's really, really nice. 
T: The taste is also big on coffee, but there's plenty of chocolate and molasses, both of which provide sweetness to counteract the roasted coffee bitterness. Cocoa powder is there too, along with a touch of drying alcohol at the finish. Some port-like raisins are present as well. I have to say the cask version of this is much better than I recall it from the bottle. 
M: Thick. Hefty. Viscous. But creamy and smooth at the same time. Intense flavors and a heavy feel are a real nice combination, makes this seem like a decadent dessert beer.
O: Awesome. Highly drinkable as an interesting, tasty beer that you won't want to stop drinking. The flavors are fairly balanced, with just enough sugar, molasses and chocolate/cocoa sweetness to cut through all of the coffee. In the bottle, I thought this beer didn't live up to its reputation. From the cask, I get it. 1,295 charactersKendo, Apr 05, 2011

This beer is exactly, and I mean EXACTLY - how you should brew a coffee based Imperial Stout. The coffee neither overpowers nor is masked by the base beer - a full-bodied and very rich RIS.

I'll say from the start that I have had a hard time finding a liking for stouts, but this one right here finally knocked some sense into me.
Pours a pitch black with a billowing 1.5 finger tan head.
Smells mostly of coffee but I as it warmed I picked up some dark chocolate and a hint of hazelnut. Delicious!
The taste was impeccable! Up front coffee taste that fades into a bitter dark chocolate. Absolutely outstanding.
I'm still getting use to the mouthfeel of stouts, but this one was definitely bearable for me. 
This is an outstanding beer, and I can't wait to hunt down some more. This has given me the courage to go out and try more stouts rather than sticking with what is safe (IPA/IIPA). There's clearly more out there to be explored. 788 charactersDearthVader, Apr 02, 2011

A: Black. Dark black. Just what I want and just what I expect in a coffee stout.
S: Roasted black coffee. Maybe a little chocolate. But pretty much just coffee. 
T: To me, when cold, a little on the bitter side. Coffee is strong. Lots of bitter cocoa and espresso. As it warms, becomes less bitter and more sweet. Leaves a kind of roasted turbinado sugar taste on the lips and in the mouth. I wish it was a little more consistent all the way through because I think it's a little too bitter cold and a little too sweet when it warms.
M:Pretty easy to drink for a 9.5% beer. Not overly thick.
Overall, this is a great coffee stout (and I do love coffee stouts!) W'N'B is still my favorite with FBS a close second, but this is up there for sure. 913 charactersbcostner1, Apr 02, 2011

S - A blast of sweet, roasty malts and followed nicely with strong coffee and a hint of cocoa. A touch of booze.
T - Intense roast right up front, magnified even more by the bitter coffee. The sweetness of the malts balance this brew out nicely. Cocoa, dark, dried fruit and a hit of booze round out the flavor of this one.
M - So smooth and creamy, coats not only your mouth but your entire insides.
D - A little boozy and probably a little overpowering for those who aren't fans of coffee in their beers, but this sucker is awesome. 623 charactersLiquidCucumber, Apr 01, 2011

A - Pours black with a very big, foamy 3 finger head, that slowly fades leaving very nice lacing, and foamy peaks.
S - Has a huge espresso smell, with slight hints of cinnamon.
T - Taste matches the smell nicely. Has a very complex flavor profile of espresso (of course), smokiness, cinnamon, licorice and a great roasty characteristic.
M - Full, heavy mouthfeel, but still very smooth going down. The alcohol isn't even detectable.

Poured into a Duvel tulip. Dark black body with no light getting through. Slim mocha head that dissipates and leaves very little lacing. Looks foreboding.
Coffee, chocolate, and a touch of roasted malt in the aroma. Just a faint notice of dark fruit that almost makes you think this was aged in a bourbon barrel.
No bourbon in the flavors, but plenty of great tastes. Like in the aroma, coffee, chocolate and roasted malt. Just a touch of bitterness that seems linked to hops. The flavors are smooth and very well blended.
Silky smooth mouthfeel that goes down easy with almost no notice of the alcohol. Very well done. Great beer. 754 charactersFanofHefe, Mar 26, 2011

Who knows what that means?
A - pours a deep crimson mahogany, filling out to a black impenetrable body and a medium brown head.
S - Was worried about the freshness of this because the indication is not clear, but there is a big and fresh bitter coffee nose here, so I guess this is probably fairly fresh. Some chocolate undertones. A really lovely nose.
T - Nice bittersweet coffee and chocolate. Dry earthy notes, and a bit of smoked meats. Pretty tasty, but doesn't quite live up to the beautiful nose.
M - Moderately smooth, moderately thick. A medium- to thick-bodied beer, a little bit smaller than you'd expect, but still a good mouthfeel.

A- Pours pitch black, but not as thick as I was expecting. Almost no light penetrates the beer at all. The head is very thick and a dark tannish/brown color. One of the darkest heads I have seen with beautiful lacing and patching. A thin ring lasts throughout. 
S- Very bold coffee up front. Too overpowering. Less noticeable are the coffee malt and musky oak notes on top of the booze smell. Not very complex, though. The coffee nearly covers everything else up.
T- As with the smell the bitter coffee flavor is noticed right away. Unlike the smell, however, I don't feel it is over-powering in the taste. As it hits the back of your plate there is a strong creamy, cocoa finish with a hint of nuttiness as well. The booze is fairly apparent on the back end also. 
M- This is a very creamy beer that feels great in your mouth. It felt about as thick as I expected from the way it poured, but still seemed a little thin for the style.
D- Very easy beer to sip and enjoy. Not something you can sip all day, though, because it is very drying. You might want to make this the last beer of a session if you are drinking multiple beers. 1,193 charactersStayWhatYouAre2, Mar 20, 2011

awesome extra from Douglasjamjak, thanks man!
Pours black with a huge craggy, billowy light brown head. The head slowly dissipates down to leave a thin coating and wonderful lacing.
This is definitely coffee-forward in both the nose and taste, though in the taste there is a pleasant cocoa backing. Fairly bitter, both from the coffee and cocoa notes.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with fizzy carbonation.
Another well done Imperial Stout, though that's about the extent of my impression. While I enjoyed it quite a bit, it lacks anything to make it really memorable. 605 charactersvkv822, Mar 17, 2011
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Had a bottle of this brought back to me from New Orleans. Served it in a Great Divide balloon glass.
The pour is great, huge tan head. Looks distinctly creamy. The body is a clear, pitch black. The only retraction is that the beer doesn't look quite as sinister as I like from my RISes.
The nose is mostly iced coffee. There's some nuttiness there and booziness. Interesting, full and bold.
The taste is mostly coffee, too. The beer is surprisingly boozy for being less than 10% ABV. The coffee overpowers what I was expecting from a double stout. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, too. Hrm. As I drink on, I can pick up nuttiness and chalkiness at add to the depth of the flavor. However, the coffee dominance and overall thinness detract from what this could be. 762 charactersUTCengOwl, Mar 13, 2011

s - not sure how fresh this bottle is (3 & 0 are punched on the side?), but the coffee is still there...roasty malts, a bit nutty, creamy, traces of vanilla. nicely balanced.
t - follows the smell but gives a chocolatey wallop as well. surprising amount of bitterness at first. settles in, but remains more bitter than i'd like but the creaminess is great.
m/d - creamy feeling, but not overly thick. mouth is cooling and a bit bitter. overall, this is a solid beer and i understand the praises (esp at the price point), a bit more bitter than i prefer. i could definitely drink this again and again, but won't be the first imperial stout i reach for. 883 characterscosmicevan, Mar 13, 2011
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4A: Pours a deep black with a thin khaki head. I had to pour vigorously just to get a small one finger head on this one. Lacing is good and resides throughout the beer.
S: Smells of coffee, chocolate, plums roasted malt and dark fruits, minimal hop aroma but that is warranted in this style, especially at 9.5% alcohol
T: Chocolate, roasted malts and plums are very apparent, it takes a bite more to recognize the coffee in there (may have something to do with age). The bitterness is offset by the sweetness but it seems to draw a good amount of bitterness from the coffee as well as hop additions. Sweetness is just right, and is very important to me in this style. This one has a perfect balance between sweet and bitter.
M: Very smooth with medium carbonation, this one finishes like velvet on the tongue. 
D: I don't care how much booze is in this one, i could easily drink more than one. The dark fruits make it a step above the other imperial stouts and puts it in a league of it's own! 992 charactersBrewbro000, Mar 09, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Current batch bottle provided (& recommended) by the awesome 'vande'. "3" and "2" notched on the label.
A- light pour into oversized tulip provided a fluffy 2 finger tan head that faded slowly and remained as a fine layer that laced nicely. Body is dark cola colored with the faintest light coming thru at the edges
S- From the pour, the coffee aroma just slams your nostrils. After settling, the aromas are so much more. Obviously coffee is the main one, but dark chocolate covered raspberries come out. While trying to get more aroma, COFFEE just comes in again!
T- Initial taste is pure espresso bean bitterness, but the sweetness comes thru and really pulls this together. It is at the edge of being "too bitter", but the awesome balance really saves this. Some hoppy bitterness seems to be in there as well, but I can't distinguish it
M- thick and creamy. Carbonation isn't too high, but just enough to really have the coffee taste kick your mouth
D- For those who like coffee, it's great. If you don't like coffee at all, stay away. 
I'm going to age a bottle and see how this one does. I know the coffee will be much less, but I think this it is a big enough beer to really kick ass aged as well 1,208 charactersimagese, Mar 07, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured this brew into a pint glass. The bottle had no bb date and some notches on the side for a bottled on date. I don't know exactly how to read this. 
A- This brew pours a thick black, that is fully opaque and impossible to see through. I good half inch of head came to show and stayed for about 3-4 minutes, it was a nice dark tan to almost brown color. Thin and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. 
S- A large amount of coffee and espresso. A nice meld of malts with a small amount of hops that play a nice back note. Dark chocolate and figs, raisins, and a bit of sourdough bread. 
T- It tastes like a cup of coffee. It has a lingering presence of espresso and chocolate. Its a complex brew to say the least, maybe im not very familiar with this type or beer but it has a lot going on. 
M&D- A full mouthful of chocolate and espresso beans. 860 charactersHOPPYKC, Mar 07, 2011

A - Darkest opaque brown possible, pretty much black. Thin, ominous head that doesn't waste time in dissipating.
S - Primarily coffee/mocha and roasted notes as advertised, secondary chocolate character. Maybe a little disappointed by the nose. 
T - More coffee in the drink than in the nose, but not overdone. Less chocolate here. Some bitterness, feels rather well-balanced. T &gt; S. Pretty *clean* taste compared to some other stouts I've tried. 
M - A dry finish. Medium-heavy body. Some alcohol presence. 
D - High drinkability. Not as much of a sipper as I might've expected, goes down easily. ABV doesn't show up @ 9.5%. Would be up for a pretty nice buzz with 2-3 in a sitting. Will buy again if I have the chance.
*After revisiting this one in recent stout tasting, the aroma seemed significantly improved and was one of the better aromas of the night. Upping the score.* 935 charactersAuracom, Mar 07, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A- Pours a dark dark brown and settles black. A half inch of khaki head floats atop and has stayed that way for over 10 minutes now. Holding up really nice. Bitter coffee aroma up front. Very inviting to say the least. Behind the espresso madness lies some dark chocolate notes. Dessert. 
T- The taste is coffee domination. Bitter roasted malt blended with some quality tasting coffee. Hints of cocoa with a bit of hop bitterness is presented. Finishing the taste is a faint alcohol taste emitting through the flavor. 
M- A creamy smooth liquid soothes the palate with each sip. a light but crisp carbonation finishes off a great mouthfeel that carries on an awesome espresso aftertaste.
D- The drinkability of this brew is high because of an awesome balance between the ingredients. this one holds up to the jype as far as coffee flavored stouts . Glad I grabbed as many as I could. DELISH 893 charactersChugginOil, Mar 05, 2011
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Missed trying this on tap, but caught one of the last few bottles at consumers anyways.
Appearance:
Start with the labeling, I dig the artwork. Following the pour into my tulip: Rich, incredibly dark black magic with a dirty snow tan-brown head that's fluffy and in full effect. Massive amounts of lacing, a dense foam halo clings to the sides as I work my way down. The head appears to be keeping a decent centimeter, weaker beers would have fallen flat by now.
Smell:
Bold mixing pot of fruit/alcohol, cocoa, banana bread, coffee, and spice. This is definitely a super vibrant beverage, more alive as it warms up from it's short stint in the fridge. To me this beer is bitter unripened fruit, dank and earthy.
Taste:
Rich coffee with a silky smooth sweetness followed by a dry bitterness that lingers after. All aspects of a good coffee imperial stout that are typically are sought after are present. At first I thought the bitterness was going to be overwhelming (as it was slightly unexpected), but my palate readily adapted to the challenge. Absolutely delicious, great balance between all the dark flavors present.
Mouthfeel:
Was initially gross-aftertaste-bitter-charred-wood, but is a memory of the past by about 1/4 of the way through the beer. Smooth and dense, full bodied beverage that will warm the soul on a cold winter night. My mouth anticipates the beer's saliva-stimulating chocolate sweetness while smelling, but the sweetness is washed away by the beers dry, hoppy finish. 
Drinkability:
A great beer as I had hoped and anticipated, unfortunately the beer is fairly expensive ($5 for 12oz). However, I've paid $10 for a bomber and not complained, so the value aspect of buying this beer is at least worth a try. I was surprised by how easily this beer went down, I had to try and not finish it too quickly. Is the beer worth the hype? questionable, but it's a damn good beer that was not a letdown.
Cheers. 1,932 charactersThePorterSorter, Mar 05, 2011

A - Pours pitch black with a burnt caramel color tight,creamy one finger head. Excellent head retention and lacing left as the head slowly comes down.. 
S - This beer explodes with dark roast coffee, roasted malts and bitter chocolate aromas. Slight hints of licorice and vanilla. I'm also getting slight heat as i inhale deeply. 
T - This is easily one of the best imperial coffee stouts i have ever had. The coffee flavors here are incredibly smooth. Although its strong, the coffee is not over powering. Its so well balanced. Its got some slight sweetness and makes the after taste remind me of some very high end dark chocolates. 
M - Thick and chewy. Medium carbonation.
D - The 9.5% abv is pretty well hidden making this one very drinkable. 790 charactersdubinsky, Mar 04, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A- Solid, thick lacing above the toasted biscuit froth, possible chocolate drizzled in between the bubbles, that never truly leaves me. Thick collar slathers on the sides with concentric circles of love. The inky, jet black darkness hides all its secrets and dares me to try and discern them. 
S- This beer just breathes coffee. It has no qualms about smacking the shit out of me with the robust nature of the bean, ground, unground, or anything in between. It even has this hidden lactose like sweetness reminding me of cream. I can't explain how phenomenal this roasted aroma is. It literally is an experience of its own. There may have been one other beer in existence to match the amazing aroma this has.
T- Whats that? You thought the nose was the only place they jam packed with coffee? Hell no, son! This is without a doubt one of the top three coffee beers I have ever had. Its very very close to being the top one, but it just can't quite make it all the way through. The flavors jump first from deep roasted coffee bean hits that remind me of espresso. From there the middle is the bitterness of fresh brewed, freshly ground, jet black java. Its that acrid mouth puckering smash of all things harsh and caffeinated. Finish is more of that burnt grain, thick coffee stab. Sometimes the middle throws you a curve ball by asking you to identify this dark berry flavor, but its not ever sip. 
M- Here... we finally de-throne you Peche... You let me down. Creamy, full bodied, but not thick. Insane lingering power and potential. It is like the in-laws that never want to leave. Tearing down the walls with their crude nature. Carbonation crisp on the opening and middle, but quick fade in the finish. 
D- Very impressed. Very, very impressed actually. Unfortunately, the alcohol is strong in the ethanolic nature of finish at times. It starts to become a problem taking too many drinks in a certain time period. I also wanted this to be thicker, almost syrupy like. It balances itself out to be a good beer. Almost a great one. With a bit of age, perhaps a month or three it could be miles better, who knows. 2,118 charactersKhazadum, Mar 03, 2011

Retention and lacing is ok, not the greatest. Smells strong of coffee, caramel, and vanilla, little sweetness to it. Taste has a nice coffee (shocker!) and sweet chocolate syrup touch to it. Little vanilla as well and again, an overall sweetness. Mouthfeel I thought was a little too thin, but not bad at all. Overall a great beer, abv is very well hidden and I really enjoyed that this was more coffee focused rather than just chocolate and roasted grains. 551 charactersbunnyhustle, Mar 02, 2011
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Served in a snifter
This beer pours a nice black body topped by a dark tan foam. The aromatics convey a sweet coffee nose as if blended with french vanilla. The taste carries over a lot of what the nose provided but the beer is a touch too acidic to make it all work well together. The acidic nature combined with the surprisingly light medium body of the beer is really the downside of this beer. This is a very nice and easy beer to drink and as it warms it opens up nicely. I must say I'm glad to have it available to me locally now. It's an solid Imperial Stout. 567 charactersVdubb86, Mar 02, 2011
4.54/5  rDev +3.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A - Pours a dark brown-black color with a finer of tan frothy head. The head eventually reduces to a solid ring around the glass and laces nicely.
S - Tons of coffee flavor alongside deep roasted carmel malt flavor. Little bit of bittersweet chocolate and a touch of hops also lightly mixed in.
T - Starts off with a really strong coffee flavor with a little bit of bitter coffee flavor. There is also some sweet roasted malt flavor and some chocolate. Through the middle there is a hit of chocolate and espresso flavor. The finish continues the chocolate and coffee flavors, and get s touch of a almost milk flavor alongside a touch of noticeable hops which all linger together. Very complex and well balanced.
M - Medium body and moderate-low amount of carbonation. Really creamy mouthfeel without feeling thick. Really nice coffee finish.
D - Very drinkable. Very nice flavors all around and the 9.5 abv is very well masked. The coffee flavors are really strong (as well as the chocolate), however, the very nice balance keeps the beer very drinkable. 1,058 charactersngeunit1, Mar 02, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: It was poured from a brown 11.2oz bottle (with cool artwork) into a tulip glass. Info on the label includes its abv (9.5%) and a nice description of the beer.
Appearance: The pour is dark brown like used motor oil and looks glossy black in the glass. On top of this dark opaque liquid sits a two finger tall dark tan head. The frothy foam is slow fading but keeps a small cap of foam for the duration of the session. It also makes nice lacing on the glass. 
Smell: The aroma is full of dark roasted and toasted malt character with notes of coffee, dark toasted bread and some boozy alcohol. I also pick up lighter notes like chocolate, earthy leather, caramel and molasses. 
Taste/Palate: Its flavor profile has just as much complexity as its aroma. There is a ton of toasted bread and grain with dark roasted coffee flavor. I get sweet bready and caramel notes with bitter coffee and chocolate. Hops are not really popping out to me but I'm sure they are adding to the bitter flavors. As it warms I get some vanilla and grainy booze notes moving in. It finishes with a mellow booze bittersweet character slow fading from the tongue. The texture is slick and smooth with soft carbonation. 
Notes: This big full bodied beer is its own dissert or if you have room maybe serve with a slice of apple pie ala mode. Either way this is an outstanding Imperial Stout. 1,377 charactersgenerallee, Feb 28, 2011

4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This beer is just an incredible experience. I'm aware of being careful about giving almost a perfect rating but really this is the best thing I ever had, and I find nothing that should be changed in it.
The smell of coffee and chocolate is just insane and overwhelms you. The first time I tasted this I was with my friend and being at his job (he owns it so no worry), we had no glass handy and we drank it from the bottle. What a shame! I will never do that again as I really realize now how pouring the beer in a snifter or other lets the smell expand.
Drink this slowly and take the time to taste it, it's a dessert in a bottle. 633 charactersTomStew, Feb 26, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottled February 2011, so very fresh
Slightly chilled, poured into a goblet
Appearance- Pours a deep deep brown, not quite black, with a dense two finger tan head. Good head retention and some nice lacing left behind. 
Smell- Lots of roasted malts, bitter coffee, chocolate, some piney hops. Though coffee, as expected, is the dominant aroma; fresh ground coffee beans. Smells fantastic!
Taste- Coffee, espresso, roasted malts, and chocolate throughout the drink. Some subtle notes of caramel and dark fruits in the middle. Some chalky cocoa, subtle pine towards the back end. Lingering bitter, roasty coffee on the palate, and it sticks around a while.
Mouthfeel- Medium body and carbonation, lighter than average for the style. Abv's are hidden very well.
Overall- Excellent beer, one of the better coffee infused stouts I have had. Awesome name, awesome label, great reputation, and the beer backs it up. 912 charactersJLeege, Feb 26, 2011
4.61/5  rDev +4.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On cask, via hand pump @ The Farmhouse (Burlington, VT) on 2/19/11. Served in a wine glass. I did this side by side with a cask serving of this beer's base Stout, the Grande Noirceur. 
Pours a black with a thin covering of burnt mocha head. This leaves just a light smattering of lacing back but does leave some gooey brown oils dripping down the sides of the glass. This looks identical to the glass of Grande Noirceur sitting next to it. The aroma is literally buzz inducing with coffee. I mean roasted espresso beans just shoot up the nose and stay there. There's a bit of underlying chocolate sweetness and maybe a touch of green citrus present but this nose is just absolutely OWNED by the coffee. This is fantastic smelling! 
The taste pretty much matches the nose, and wow man, this is just pure coffee flavor. This is probably the most that I've ever felt in a Coffee Stout. The bitterness from the roast and green citric hops are actually well balanced by those chocolate and caramel malts that are present but man, the parching dry roasted coffee finish on this is one of the more intense that I've ever encountered. I literally had a lingering hazy burnt roast feel hang on my palate for up to a ½ hour after I finished this glass. And it was only a half pour! The mouthfeel is fuller bodied with a mellow and creamy feel up front but then gets much sharper towards the swallow. That bigger ABV here is showing itself a bit here on cask and it's not coming off as hot in any way but does make sure that you take your time with this one. 
I love this beer out of the bottle and to finally have this beer cask conditioned off the hand pump was a real treat. I mean, this is about as unadulterated of an experience that you can have with a coffee beer IMHO. The intense combination of the alcohol and roast here on cask was something that I won't forget for a while. Just completely awesome stuff. 1,909 charactersKegatron, Feb 24, 2011

This has a fantastic mouthfeel. Absolutely fantastic and super drinkable. I wish this was available more often. It is a very solid beer but at the same time not quite worth the money. 637 charactersbeerhan, Feb 24, 2011

S= awesome, coffee, more coffee, coffee grinds, chocolate and burnt malts, maybe a hint of a single hop ... lol
T= like iced coffee with chocolate, or like when you get to the bottom of your coffee mug and the coffee grinds flow into your mouth. If you're like me and love coffe, then it's appreciated. As much as I like coffee, I wonder if coffee grinds will be in the bottom of my mug. Slightly warming from 9+%. 
M= creamy and smooth, mild to med. Carbonation. 
D= since you only need 2 I scored it well here. I don't think I could go for three, but drinkability is good enough until you have had enough alcohol! If you drink a whole lot like I do sometimes, the drinkability is lower, I just don't want more than 2 12oz bottles, but this is an awesome brew ! 906 charactersStoneyrok, Feb 20, 2011

Pours a deep brown color which nears blackness as a crazily thick coffee brown head bubbles up to the rim of the glass. Retains solidly with thick film and layers of lacing wrapped on the glass.
Intense coffee nose with whole bean, espresso, bitter dark chocolate and rich roasted malt with slight alcohol warmth. 
An immediate splash of coffee soaked chocolate with lighter espresso and toffee notes. Light hop bitterness mixes in before more dark, rich roasted malts. Caramel and sweetness with continuing coffee flavor. Finishes slightly dry and hoppy with soft boozy warmth.
Full bodied, pleasant creamy texture, and a bit chewy. Slick, smooth drinking, and clearly a very nice imperial coffee stout but not quite better than my all time favorite, FBS. 829 charactersxnicknj, Feb 19, 2011

4.77/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Sat on this for over a year. Snifter pour and I am met with a beautiful black ale with a huge mocha colored foamy head that clings to the glass. The robust smell of coffee and chocolate are in the aroma. Roasted malts, vanilla and some light booze are also there. Awesome. The taste is out of sight. Chocolate on the front and more chocolate on the swallow. A nice blend of bitter at the beginning followed by a rich creamy cocoa, roasted malt finish. Smokey goodness lingers after the swallow. Light bitterness on the aftertaste. Perfect! Smooth and creamy all the way on the mouthfeel. A little oily but does not detract. Great drinkability...but the best way to enjoy this is in a snifter with light sips to fully get the most out of this phenomimal beer. 758 characterskaseydad, Feb 14, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was surprised by my good buddy AwYeh's opinion of this beer so much that I had to try my bottle when I saw his review. Pours an opaque black with some light tan head on top that was generated with one of the highest, most aggressive pours I have ever done. Bubbles are large both in the base of the lace, and in the middle on top; they dissipate quickly, leaving some residue on the glass. 
Nose is a strong odor of a double mocha coffee, with lots of coffee and chocolate. Chocolate is milky, and sweetened in the aroma, not dark as is regularly encountered in big coffee stouts like this. Get a little bit of milk chocolate near the end of the nose as well to confirm this. A bit of dark fruit in the nose while it warms up, but not a whole lot, as chocolate and coffee hold strong throughout. A tiny bit of booze shows its face near the end as well. 
Taste throws a curveball initially, with a bit of dark fruit that is stronger than in the nose hitting you early. I can't really distinguish what fruit it is, but it is dark fruit for sure. It QUICKLY moves to a strongly bitter, unsweetened coffee that is delicious in every regard. Chocolate is also unsweetened for this part (unlike in the nose) and offers a different kind of bitterness and creaminess that isn't offered by the coffee. This is totally unsweetened to the point that, in the complete absence of any hop flavor, this one leaves your tongue with an intensely bitter aftertaste, something I love when I drink coffee unsweetened. A bit of the milky chocolate comes out if you let the carbonation do its work in your mouth, which is a nice change of pace. Don't get confused though: the coffee is the star of the show, as it is roasted and strong, similar to AleSmith Speedway Stout. 
Mouthfeel is just superb, as it is creamy and smooth, leaving a generous coating in your mouth with each sip. This one is INCREDIBLY drinkable, with not even a peep from the 9.5% abv, and an awesome bitter finish that makes you want another swig. I don't what to say AwYeh, other than maybe your bottle was messed up, because this beer is simply phenomenal. 2,114 charactersveinless, Feb 14, 2011

About 2 fingers of tight dark tan head forms, which has great retention. Lacing is very nice...this is a phenomenal looking beer. 
Smell: Roasted malts and coffee are the main scents in this beer. Definitely some vanilla and light bitter chocolate, and a bit of alcohol as well. 
Taste: Roasted malts and coffee comprise most of the flavor in this beer. I also get light vanilla and chocolate, as well as an alcohol kick at the finish. This beer is very good, but not the best coffee-infused stout I've had.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is in between medium and heavy bodied, and very creamy. I'd call it just a bit light for the style, but I won't retract much from the mouthfeel due to the general creaminess. Overall, a pretty drinkable beer. Not the most drinkable I've had due to the sheer amount of coffee bitterness, but still absolutely worth a shot. 969 characterszhanson88, Feb 13, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle Poured into an over sized wine glass. Bottled in February 2011. Very fresh bottle.
Appearance- Pours a deep black color, no light shining through. Beautiful creamy mocha head that dissipates quickly. About 1 finger of head. Spotted sticky lacing with some long legs.
Smell- Coffee dominates the nose, chocolate in the background, and a little bit of alcohol hotness, with a bit of pine notes from the hops in the background.
Taste- Great taste. Coffee is up front with some chocolate in the background, much like the smell. Can't taste much alcohol, hidden very well. Pretty hoppy, mostly because its very fresh. I think with a couple months that will subdue some and let the roasted characters dominate. This does taste quite a bit differently fresh. 
Mouthfeel/Drink- Pretty good mouthfeel, medium to full bodied. Seems a little bit watered down. Drinkability is very good. Can't taste much of the alcohol at all. 926 charactersdsartwell72, Feb 12, 2011
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle into a Duvel tulip. There's no bottling date, but my cellar spreadsheet tells me I purchased it at Julio's in late 2009.
A: A slow, high, steady pour results in a solid finger of two-part head: frothy light-brown on top from the turbulence, creamy and darker underneath from the slowly-developing, super-fine bubbles that rise from the dark depths below. Intensely black body, but not without some clear red tints when held up to bright light. Great looking stout.
S: Wow. Even after over a year of mellowing in my cellar, this one still packs a serious coffee punch. The coffee is intense, showing some light acidity and even a hint of citrus, but never distracting from pure roasty power. There's also a touch of dark chocolate, but this one is 99% coffee. And that's a great thing.
T: No surprises here, with delicious coffee dominating throughout. Some chocolately malt sweetness does creep in midway through, but the coffee provides plenty of back-end bitterness and clean, almost vinous, acidity. A touch of alcohol shows up on the aftertaste, but that's a forgivable quibble for such a delicious beer. Awesome.
M: Rather delicate medium body with restrained, soft carbonation. Nice, but gets a touch sticky and could use a little more life.
D: Excellent. Aside from some light stickiness and a touch of booze, this is an absolute joy to drink. I wish it came in a bomber.
Notes: Powerful yet delicate, this beer manages to be both sweet and bitter, single-minded and complex. I've been having a lot of coffee stouts this winter, and this one is undeniably one of the best. It might well have scored considerably higher if I hadn't recently had Coffee IST, which was light-years better than just about everything, including amazing beers like this one. I'll definitely have to pick up another few bottles whenever I see it again, as I definitely need to try it fresh, and yet now I know that it ages beautifully. Wonderful stuff.

4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance. Pours a deep, dark brown with an almost oily look to it. Half a finger head that fades to a foamy film and leaves a little lacing.
Smell. Coffee liquor, some vanilla, dark cherries, a little dark chocolate and yes, a hint of soy sauce.
Taste. Bitter, slightly sour coffee and toasted malt. Lasting bitterness with complex coffee, chocolate, dark fruits and tobacco notes. 
Mouthfeel. Medium bodied with a nice medium-low carbonation. 
Drinkability. For the style, a great drinker. That being said, one is enough for me and there's no mistaking this one's imperial validity.
Tried this one few months back and was not all that impressed. This time I was blown away. Really nice and different. 708 charactersRutager, Feb 09, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a Vertical Jewbelation glass from an 11.5oz bottle. Pours a deep black with a 1/4 inch head, minimal lace. The smell is light, but very complex. The coffee is right up front, fresh beans. After the coffee there are nice roasted malts, cocoa and a touch of booze. The taste follows the smell but is very rich, glad I picked it as my dessert beer. The coffee is certainly a dark roast, the chocolate bitter sweet, the roasted malts bring a sweetness and charred taste. Smooth and thick going down. I rate this up with AleSmith's Speedway Stout for sure. A very fine example of the style. My second beer from this French Canadian Brewery and I'm sold. 660 charactersOBeerMeGreatOne, Feb 08, 2011

A. 3+ finger dark tan head. Great retention. Excellent lacing. Color is jet black. Very nice appearance for an Imperial Stout. 
S. Great coffee imperial stout aroma. Coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt. Coffee is the dominant smell for me.
T. Taste is also very coffee forward. Roasted malt, dark chocolate, bitter coffee. Well balanced and smooth. A great beer for coffee lovers, which I am not but still appreciate a good beer when I taste one. 
M. Medium/full bodied. Nice mouthfeel. Adequate carbonation.
D. A very well crafted Imperial Stout. If you like coffee beers I can't imagine one better than this. I love Imperial Stouts but don't necessarily love the big coffee ones. This is a great beer for sure, just not my favorite Imperial Stout. 792 characterssiradmiralnelson, Feb 06, 2011

4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours pitch black with a big tan head. The head has nice retention, almost there till the last drop, and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is pretty strong on coffee, pretty much dominates the smell. Other smells are a little bit of chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is pretty much identical to what the smell has. And as this one warms up it gets better and better. I like this one a lot because although the taste and smell are pretty heavy with coffee it's not to much and overwhelming, unlike other coffee flavored stouts. The mouthfeel is very creamy which I didn't expect from this but it's very nice. Drinkability is kind of dangerous on this one. almost 10% ABV and I don't detect any alcohol. If I had more I could do a couple of these no problem. Overall I'd pick this up again for sure. Only the second beer I've had from this brewery and both were top notch, especially this one. 905 charactersdismal, Feb 02, 2011

On nose, espresso and a touch of petrol. Smells just like dark roast coffee
On palate, super dry, espresso, oily texture. After 2 years and it is still showing a good bit of alcohol. Very bitter on finish.
Drinkability-so dry and bitter that it's a sipper. I wouldn't want a second. Would go well with some blue cheese.

It is black in color with a thin tan head that soon fades away.
Smell has coffee right away, along with roasted malts, some vanilla too. Taking a sip of this long awaited beer for me, it tastes like coffee, chocolate, alcohol, bitter finish. A full bodied brew with a creamy texture. With the high abv, that you are likely to expect from the style, this is a sipper. It is a nice imperial stout, but for me, it did not live up to the hype. 480 charactersmltobin, Feb 01, 2011

S - espresso beans/coffee and chocolate wafts up from the glass almost instantly, followed by touches of vanilla/cream
T - coffee and vanilla, alcohol is present enough to contribute to the flavor but isn't overbearing, hints of dark fruit in there too. The espresso flavor is probably one of the richest I've ever tasted in a beer. I get a slight hint of anise/black licorice as it warms, with brown sugar maybe
M - this is where this beer shines. it doesn't just taste like a coffee stout, it FEELS like a coffee stout...creamy and smooth...like drinking espresso with cream. just a tingle of carbonation
D - given the abv, this beer is as drinkable as it gets

Great looking Imperial stout. Black in color with a tan head that settles to a ring around the goblet. It smells of typical roastiness with a load of coffee. I'm a fan. 
Very smooth taste that most Imperial stouts fail to produce. Nice roast character balanced well with good amount of coffee. Slightly spicy/peppery aftertaste. Quite enjoyable.
I am very impressed with the balance of carbonation and thickness of the beer. Its viscous, yet has a tingly mouthfeel. Nearly ideal for my tastes. 
drinkability - goes down smooth. Thats all. 
I'll be looking for this in the future. 654 characters700Uave, Jan 27, 2011

4.72/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Mortal Sin has a chocolate brown body, topped with a fine layer of cocoa-colored foam and lacing that you'd expect from a coffeehouse latte. Carbonation is a little lively for the style, as is the whole look in general. Beautiful presentation!
The first whiff hits you in the face with a big espresso aroma, followed by a slight booziness and fruity sweetness. Syrupy chocolate and a roasted dryness are also noticeable amidst the multi-layered and unique aroma.
Coffee flavor is extremely forthright. As it warms, plum and prune flavors peak out, countered slightly by chocolate and salty peanut notes. If you let it swish in your mouth, you can taste the coffee, cream and sugar. I've been bowled over by the amount of flavor this beer manages to pack in each time I've tried it. This is certainly the tops for the style.
With all that flavor, it's obvious that the mouth wouldn't be subtle. The espresso dryness and bite lingers for what seems like forever. It's not only an assault on the taste buds, but it gave me a bit of a tickle in the back of my nose.
This bad boy is definitely a sipper, not in the sense that it has a huge ABV, but in the sense that the flavors are so big that you need to give your tongue time to process. 
An absolute show stopper and the stout by which all others should be judged. 1,318 charactersdeapokid, Jan 25, 2011

A - Jet black with a small amount of mocha foam. Some lacing around the glass.
S - The smell of coffee is dominant. Wow, this is the the strongest coffee smell of any stout I can recall. Behind that, some roasty malt and cocoa is present.
T - A phenomenal taste of coffee with vanilla. Gives way to a whiskey-like finish. Just a great tasting stout.
M - Silky smooth. You don't feel like you are drinking a heavy beer. 
D - Would be tough to have too many of these, but you would certainly want to. 
This is a must have stout for coffee lovers. Probably one of the smoothest imperial stouts available.... anywhere. 642 characterssocon67, Jan 24, 2011

The head reminds me very much of an ice cream milkshake. Dense, thick legs as I tilt the glass; ring-around-the-lacing as the head dissipates. 
Initially oaky aromas, with cocoa nibs, vanilla, roasts, and berries copiously scattered throughout to produce a pleasantly complex bouquet. 
Flavors of bitter, roasty coffee notes up front, with more oaky, vanilla, and berries wafting throughout the mid-point to the finish. Truth be told, the aforementioned flavors dance all over this bad boy; it's a roast bomb amongst roast bombs, and includes a lot of other goodies to make for some fine sipping. 
Mouthfeel is silky but thinner in consistency than what I prefer. A little swishing, however, carries a long way in pillowing the palate slightly. 
Overall, the reputation of this beer precedes itself, with a powerful, nearly overwhelming roastiness balanced by a plethoric range of bitter and sweet. Not exactly smooth drinking, and the label's admonition to drink in moderation is duly noted, but damn, I want me another one of these (right now, same session) in order to come to grips with just how coffee-"lish" this is. 1,221 charactersjminsc76, Jan 23, 2011

poured into a large snifter. huge billowy head with excellent retention and lacing. smell of roasted coffee hits strongly on the first sniff. it also gives off that "makes you sneeze" effect of black pepper. 
nice coffee flavor, with only a slight hint of bitterness. chocolate in the finish. mouthfeel is thick and slick, almost slightly "oily" with little to no coating. It is very smooth and no burn from the alcohol. perhaps the best overall mouthfeel I've ever gotten from a stout, although I was hoping for a bit more coffee in the flavor. It's possible this is not a fresh bottle, but who knows since it's impossible to pinpoint a date on this thing. 
Drinkability is very high, and comparable to expresso yeti and FBS (my two favorite "coffee" stouts). This is a really good beer, probably not worth the price tag on the 12 oz bottle that I had to pay to try it, but the beer is excellent. Again, not being able to date it is frustrating and I can only fault the brewer on this. 1,045 charactersBlanco, Jan 22, 2011

S: I have to couch this with the disclaimer that I'm a coffee lover. That being said, Oh My Goodness! Dark, rich burnt espresso overtake my nose... Smells like the last sip or two of an espresso that are big and bitter with that delicious burnt coffee flavor. 
T: Again lots of coffee with faint hints of dark chocolate and hints of dark malts. Ends with the drying, chalkiness of dark chocolate and very bitter coffee. Love it!
M: Slightly drying... Lightly carbonated but it works with this beer because it leaves you with the idea in the back of your head that you're drinking an iced coffee. Leaves the coffee flavor and dryness in the mouth that makes you want more... 
D: Too high for this ABV. One of my absolute favorites... 
I waited awhile until this hit the shelves again in Atlanta and it was worth the price tag, but at $4-5 a 12oz, buying it frequently would be pricey. Nicely done! 1,034 charactersDouble06, Jan 18, 2011

The nose hits you with a sharp coffee/espresso aroma up front followed by chocolate a little cherry and roasted malt. WOW, a lot of coffee in the aroma. The heavy coffee aroma allows you to breath it in as you drink the beer. 
The coffee is followed quickly by a tangy citrus hop character, then the roast malt, and finally some cherry chocolate on the finish. There is a mild bitterness that retains for a while. 
The beer is thick and rich, and has a decent drinakbility. The sharp bitterness detracts just a little. 653 characterstobin, Jan 17, 2011

S: Smells like iced coffee with maybe a hit of chocolate syrup. Nice but not overly potent.
T: Deep dark coffee bean... Dark chocolate covered espresso bean type flavors but you get a sense of the oil of the coffee bean. Like when you actually bite into an actual bean or hold it in your hand... the oil has a distinctive flavor when the beans are fresh and in bulk (in a barrel). Its nicely dry in the finish (truly reminiscent of black coffee).
M: Prickly 
D: This is rather high for me given the abv given the style given the intensity of flavor and due to the overall dryness of the beer. It drinks like coffee. 824 charactersflannelman808, Jan 15, 2011

A - black as night with a one finger khaki head that dissipates very quickly down to just a very thin film on the surface. The legs are sticky and foamy and around for awihle.
S - REAL heavy dark fruit, just loads and loads of plum and raisin with notes of cherry, chocolate and a handful of smoke.
T - With some age on this, the flavors predominantly turn into 
a dark fruit bomb with raisin, plum, a little fig and molasses all over the place. I'm happy to say that a fair amount of dark chocolate is still here, my favorite part of the taste as the dark fruit combo isn't my friend. The finish is phenomenal with bits of toffee, caramel and plenty of smoke. I poured this on the colder side and as it warms, its turning into a really nice sipper. 
M - So viscous, with just enough carbonation to keep your mouth distracted with how thick this is. This mouthfeel is pretty serious business.
D - Very high. The viscosity and "sipper" qualities this has have me hooked. 1,101 charactersdrewba, Jan 14, 2011
4.02/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Peche Mortel is the flagship ale of Dieu du Ciel, a tiny microbrewery/brewpub in Montreal, Canada that is committed to quality and creativity. It is a bottle-conditioned Imperial Stout, infused during the brewing process with real, fair-trade coffee. Historically, this style of beer was produced in England to be exported to Russia for the Tsar's Court, hence the true name, Imperial Russian Stout. To prepare for the long voyage across the Baltic, Imperial Stouts were made high in alcohol (9 to 10% alcohol by volume is common) and bitterness to preserve and prevent them from freezing. 
As you may have guessed by now, despite the name, Peche Mortel has nothing to do with peaches. Turns out "Peche" is French for peach, fishing, and of course, sin. Consider the effect you will get from the 9.5% ABV and the caffeine buzz all at once, and that's why Peche Mortel translates in French to "Mortal Sin." So drink in moderation, and don't worry, if you appreciate really good coffee, and love a good beer, I'm sure you'll be forgiven.
Peche Mortel pours thick, dense, and black. It has a tall, billowing, tan head, reminiscent of the foam on top of my latte earlier today. Probably because the smell of fresh coffee grounds is so powerful! The use of a strong, fair-trade coffee certainly intensifies the bitterness of the beer, and the flavor is almost more like espresso than coffee. It is also loaded with the qualities of unsweetened cocoa, toasty malt, burnt sugar, and vanilla, hiding the 9.5% alcohol very well. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and the finish leaves you ready for more. What makes Peche Mortel so impressive is how well the intense richness of the coffee is balanced with the deep roasted malt, so that it is still more of a beer than a triple-shot of espresso. 
This is definitely a beer to pair with dessert. The richer the better. Milk chocolate won't do the trick. There used to be a place in Boulder called Blue Bakery that was known for their rich chocolate brownies with caramel and sea salt on top... amazing! This, or any other chocolate, caramel, sea salt dessert (which have become very popular) will pair very well with Peche Mortel because they have similar flavors and are both very rich. The little bit of saltiness will also make it interesting, and compliment the sweetness of the beer. 
Don't forget, Russian Imperial Stouts are great for aging due to the high gravity of the style, they can even improve in character over this time. 2,475 charactersKDeLibero, Jan 12, 2011

Coffee taste is at the forefront, with the dark malts hiding in the background. I am sure hops were used, but the bitterness is from the roasted malts and coffee . It is full flavored, but lacking a little balance as the coffee flavour dominates.
If you love coffee this beer is for you. If you don't love coffee, it is still worth seeking out.
Great mouthfeel, a balanced bodied, and a perfect dessert beer or digestif. One was enough for 3 of us after the meal. 583 characterssasky7777, Jan 11, 2011

Very unique, immediately distinctive aroma. Earthy and herbal scent. Some roast aroma in the back and no hint of sweetness.
Flavor is as unique as the aroma promised. Peaty, mellow coffee, not overpowering, smoky. As it warms, the roast coffee flavor comes through more. It's not a big coffee stout but there is a coffee flavor among the mellow peat/smoky malt flavors.
Drinks easily and lightly. I could easily drop two of these back to back. The aftertaste is peaty and sticky. 624 charactersbirderbeerer, Jan 11, 2011

It slowly dies down to a thin layer, but then sticks around. The best lacing I have seen on a stouts in my opinion. This looks like a 5.
S-Pure coffee bean. Strong coffe aroma. I am a big coffee drinker and I love the smell of coffee, so naturally I find this beer to smell delectable. I am getting some dark chocolate notes as well. But the nose is definately dominated by coffee aroma.
T-Tastes like espresso. Absolute coffee rush. As the taste evolves on the palate, it becomes more and more coffee-like. The taste lingers forever as well. This brew is wonderfully bitter as well. Chocolate and some dried fruitiness comes out as well but this beer is all about the coffee/java flavors.
M-Luscious mouthfeel. Nice and thick but not overly sludgy. Creamy.
D-9.5% hidden masterfully. Needs to be sipped, but this brew is by no means low on drinkability.

Nose is fresh coffee beans, blueberries, dark chocolate - all with bright high fruity notes jumping out - though it settles to mostly coffee after it opens. 
Coffee, bran muffin, a sunflower seed nuttiness, some brown sugar, slight grape skin tartness from the malts along with hints of ash and vanilla, a bit of roasty astringency then lemon zest hops. Finish is an amazing sequence - sweet roast, hops bitterness, tingling carbonation and then lasting dryness. Coats the tongue so that saliva tastes of coffee! Round, smooth, heavy, little burn. 
There's so many ways to do this wrong: too sweet, too much coffee, too hot, too roasty. Check out Terrapin to see what I mean. And that balance makes this all the more impressive.
A colossal RIS even without the coffee. Dieu du Ciel hits this right out of the park. For breakfast, evening or anytime! 995 charactersStJamesGate, Dec 31, 2010

App- Even with an extremely agressive pour I only managed a pencil thin head. A very dark brown with some amber/ruby on the edges. Had very little lacing or retention either.
Smell- A very strong roasted, malt coffee and dark chocolate. This is what I was expecting but this was a bit more upfront.
Taste- Wow, I can see why this is so highly rated. I finally agree with a high rating. This is very good. It's complex and flavorful and very multi-faceted. It's got that coffee bitterness with a thick creamy sweetness to it.
Mouth- Medium bodied with a low carb level to achieve a very nice rich creamy texture.
Drink- Outstanding stout. A very well done Double Stout. 715 charactersFosterJM, Dec 30, 2010

There is something I'm not really a big fan of with this beer. I love coffee porter and stouts, but this one just doesn't rub me the right way. 
It has good mouthfeel, smells good, looks great... the taste is just an extremely bitter coffee flavor, almost like spent coffee grinds, and not in a good way. The balance is off with this beer... especially when compared to others in this category of coffee porter/stouts.
The balance in Speedway Stout (all 9 versions that I've tried), Alpine Token, or even MS Arctic Rhino make them much more palatable beers. This is just not my cup of tea. 
Because of this, the heat is extremely apparent to my palate, and is not hidden well at all. I can sip this one, but that's about it. I'm not really enjoying it, although I could see how someone would like this. 
Oh well.. based on previous reviews, it'd probably be heresy, but I'll probably drain pour the last 5oz of this beer and open up a Silva Stout or Stone IRS or something like that. I just don't like this one :( 1,100 charactersjohndoe8, Dec 29, 2010
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 411.2oz bottle poured into my handy tulip. 
Pitch black pour with a light mocha head. Only a fingers worth of head, with moderate lacing. 
This is one seductive mistress. Strong sweetness on the nose, near bourbon quality. Mild fruity hints in the background, somewhat like maraschino cherry. Coffee bitterness is well balanced, and hidden. Alcohol, what alcohol. A bit cloying as it warms. 
For a coffee stout, this has a ridiculous amount of malt backing. Coffee flavor is throughout, giving a nice bitterness that resonates underneath the roasted sweet malt. Fruit esters come back into play again, giving a nice cherry note. Well balanced, and very seducing. 
Mildly creamy body, moderate carbonation, no alcohol noticeable throughout the sipping. My word, this is one inviting and deceiving mistress. Tread lightly. 823 charactersCheesemoose, Dec 28, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Surprised that I have never rated this one as it is a long time staple for me in the winter.
Poured from a bottle into my Duvel glass. 
A - Pours nearly jet black with a slowly building mocha head that has good retention and lacing left behind. A really sinister looking brew- outstanding!
S - A really nice blend of coffee, roasted malts, and some hints of bitter chocolate.
T - As others have said, a jolt of serious coffee upfront that is followed by some roasted char malts and some bitter chocolate as well. It is a little bit on the bitter side - think somewhat burnt coffee and dark bitter chocolate. It would be nice if it was a bit smoother for me. It is very nice but the bitterness in the finish is slightly a put-off for me. 
M - Very rich and nice. A real winner here.
D - If it was a pinch smoother and not so bitter on the finish I would probably say that this is the best of all coffee beers. 
On balance, I would say that this is slightly better than Founders Breakfast Stout. Very similar to me with both being the measuring sticks for coffee infused beers.
It's sister beer Aphrodite is really nice as well. 1,134 charactersBeerisheaven, Dec 27, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into a snifter. Beer is a deep dark brown, bordering on black, that reveals it's brown color at the edge of the glass when held up to a light. Initial finger of chocolate brown head, creamy with a few large bubbles mixed in, that dissipated quickly, leaving some nice lacing on the glass. Decent amount of carbonation seen at the edge of the glass just under the surface. 
After opening the bottle, the aroma can be detected right away. Very strong fruity coffee and dark chocolate, roasted dark malts. Intense but not overly bitter based on the lack of burnt sugar or hoppy aromas. 
Taste does not disappoint. Lots of fresh fruity coffee from a medium roast, dark chocolate upfront with some of the dark malts coming through to help the flavor linger on the tongue. Alcohol content is hidden very well as there is not a hint of booziness in this beer. 
Full bodied and slick beer, viscous and oily, coating your tongue with flavor that lingers, but not overly bitter at all. Your taste buds will be beaten into submission by the intense coffee and chocolate, making it beg for the next sip. 1,115 charactersnataku00, Dec 25, 2010
4.21/5  rDev -4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to OakedCanuck for sending this bottle.
Pours deep, opaque brown, and produces about a finger of extremely persistent tan head.
Coffee and roasted malt really define the smell, with some bitter chocolate notes lingering in the background.
The flavors open with the big roastiness and coffee apparent in the smell. There is just a hint of chocolate, and then beer finishes quite dry, dark, and bitter.
Smooth and a bit creamy, this beer has a very nice mouthfeel, and well concealed alcohol. Impressively drinkable. 525 charactersPellinore1, Dec 23, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a bottle into my Zatec fluted glass. Black. Tan thick thick 3 fingers of head. Does not recede. Just stays. Jim Koch mentions that you can float a bottle cap on Sam Adams head. Well I think you might be able to do that on this! A blast of espresso up my nose. Smells incredible. Toasty. Some sweet malt. Sweet malt up front on the palate. Then a blast of dark chocolate, and a double blast of espresso deliciousness. Creamy but light on the mouth. Does NOT taste like 9.5. An epic stout. 499 charactersWestValleyIPA, Dec 23, 2010
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours a deep black, with a thick tan head. Retains well, leaving nice spots of lacing.
S: Subtle roasted malts, with some earthy coffee notes, and some nuttiness. Nice balance overall, though not as strong as some imperial stouts.
T: Full with a strong malt background. Some nut and dark roasted coffee flavors. Very nice overall, full flavor, but balanced.
M: Medium to full body; starts and finishes full, but medium to light near the middle. Medium carbonation.
D: Very drinkable, especially for an imperial stout. 524 charactersseand, Dec 22, 2010

Aroma - wow! Chocolate milk, and a cross between brewed and sweetened sumatra coffee and espresso. 
The taste is like a dark-chocolate baileys cream...you taste hot chocolate up front from the warmth of the alcohol. Espresso beans provide a long-lasting bitterness to the finish that's enjoyable. 
Medium body with above average carbonation. Drinkability is pretty...good...not stellar because of the 9.5% abv, but good for that level of heat and the style. I must say, I kept reaching for it and had no problem drinking it! 585 charactersjbertsch, Dec 21, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4After having this a while back on tap, I've been waiting to try the bottled version, so here we go...
A: Pours an inky, opaque black into a snifter... looks kind of like I'm holding an 8-ball its so darn black; the thin, mocha head that's there on the pour maintains a thin haze of retention throughout consumption; nice rings of lace get left on the glass after each sip.
S: Well... coffee; dark chocolate; some charry notes; crushed coffee beans; maybe a touch of toffee, as well; aroma itself is almost intoxicating.
T: Initial dark chocolate sweetness is followed by burnt malt and some molasses; some acrid bitterness and oatmeal characteristics on the finish. Of course, coffee and espresso notes are there throughout each sip.
M: Medium bodied (lighter than expected) and a bit sticky on the palate; moderate carbonation for the style (a bit more than I'd prefer, personally).
D: Delicious; very drinkable; alcohol is virtually undetectable; awesome beer. This is one of my favorite coffee stouts, no question... this completely blows away the draft I had a few months ago. 1,085 charactersjpro, Dec 21, 2010
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 412 oz bottle poured into Duck Rabbit snifter.
Pours a jet black with a medium brown frothy, bubbly foam that dissipates at a medium pace leaving little dots of lace all over the glass. Aroma is delicious with strong coffee, cream, and chocolate...almost an iced caffe mocha smell. There is also an understated dry roastiness here that is very nice and keeps it from being overly silky sweet. The taste is bitter, fruity coffee upfront followed by a blast of dry dark chocolate and finishing with a chocolate covered coffee bean aftertaste on the tongue. Very slight booziness, but it is completely overpowered and overshadowed by the coffee and chocolate that ranges from bitter to sweet and back to bitter again. The depth of flavor here is phenomenal. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth with just enough carbonation to keep it lively. I could probably have a couple of these in a sitting, and the strong flavors don't stop me from wanting to go back for another sip. One of the best coffee stouts I've had. 1,010 charactersdgfair, Dec 21, 2010

4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured almost black with hints of dark brown with a minimal tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and alcohol on the followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. It wasn't very complex as I would have hoped for, but it was still pretty damn tasty. With that being said, it was still kinda boozy. So I will say this... If you like liquor in your coffee this one is a must! If you don't, maybe you should try it sometime. It helps to get rid of 'a case of the Mondays'. 731 charactersthagr81us, Dec 16, 2010

A.
a nice dark black with about 2-3 fingers worth of frothy light brown head. Slight lacing but nothing ridiculous.
S.
huge aroma of coffee. A little chocolate and subtle soy sauce smell, probably the hops. I haven't smelled a bourbon county coffee stout, but I would imagine it smells exactly like this (minus the bourbon of course)
T.
sweet roasted coffee! Coffee dominant but there is a little sweetness and booziness in there as well. Might be one of the best tasting coffee stouts I've had and I'm not a huge fan of coffee. A touch of bitterness which is ideal for a slightly sweet stout.
M.
full bodied with perfect carbonation. Very creamy going down and leaving a slightly dry finish. Alcohol is very warming.
D.
I could drink this every week. A little hard to find in the area and pricey from what I hear, but i will definitely be seeking this out. 887 characterscetherid, Dec 14, 2010

S. Fresh ground coffee aromas dominate. I also get dark roasted malt, cream, soy sauce and herbal hops. Just a hint of alcohol is present. 
T. Coffee and roasted malt start things off. No alcohol is present. Finishes with good bitterness and length from both the hops and the coffee. 
M. Full bodied with excellent creaminess. This just caresses and coats my entire mouth. 
D. For an Impy Stout, this drinks quite easily. More than one in a night might be a stretch but there is no denying that this is an excellent beer. Highly recommended. 630 charactersbound4er, Dec 11, 2010

Bold aromas and tastes of coffee, dark malts, roasted malts and a dash of booze.
Alcohol is respectably hidden, but evident if you hunt for it.
Mouthfeel is medium body for a stout this big, I would prefer a more full body.
Very drinkable for a stout this big, heavy in coffee, a bit dry and boozy, anything but but sweet with a solid bitter coffee note.
A great one to split for my wifes birthday on a cold night in December. 546 charactersunclejimbay, Dec 06, 2010

A - Very black pour with a small amount of tan head. Head didn't stick around long.
S - Get a sweet aroma from the malts up front. Coffee comes through till the end. Not as upfront on the coffee aroma as I'd imagine.
T - A lot more coffee flavor than what the nose led on. Some bitterness with the coffee flavor but very subtle. Nice malt backbone to this beer which makes it very smooth to drink. 
M- Full body with very little carbonation.
D- Not a huge fan of coffee beers, I am not a coffee drinker. However I do love to try these beers and this one was very good. I would drink another one of these if I had one. 703 charactersHosP, Dec 05, 2010

A: Pours black body and tan head. Rather full head which is good and dense. No carbonation seen in the glass as it is opaque. 
S: Really nice coffee aroma and some bitter chocolate notes. Great roasted nose that is very robust.
T/M: Big coffee flavors up front, then you get a nice bitter dark chocolate flavor. This seems to be more mellow at first and then really opens up when the beer warms a bit. Not much for and alcohol presence until it really warms up and then it does become noticeable. Very smooth mouth feel that coats the mouth.
D: Great coffee stout. Does not claim to be a chocolate stout although those flavors are present as well. Loved this beer, if I found it more often I would buy it more often! 756 charactersmbusster88, Dec 05, 2010

pours out pitch black with an coffee/ expresso colored creamy head. a nice lace and good retention.
aroma is full of heavily roasted/ burnt malts and fusil alcohol. a delicious smelling roasted expresso/ coffee smell comes in as the beer warms and it is absolutly suberb! it rules out almost everything once the beer has really warmed and opened up. it smells like im sniffing a handful of expresso beans or even my coffee pot. toffee and chocolate in the background. i never want to stop smelling this beer!
heavily roasted burnt malt, rich bitter roasted expresso beans, dark chocolate. so nice, the coffee flavor is so authentic. best example of coffee ive ever had in a beer. bits of toffee in the background.
very full bodied and rich. bitter expresso and dark chocolate lingers on the palate. very mild on the alcohol heat.
i would drink of much of this as i could, but definatly not a session beer. just begun to see this around town so ill definatly be revisiting. 
when i first opened, smelled, and tasted this beer, i was almost a little disappointed. i didnt get all that huge coffee. then after about ten minutes, the coffee/ expresso REALLY opened up and continued to improve. a great beer. highly recommended. 1,451 charactersdogfishandi, Dec 03, 2010

A: Pours a rich deep brown in color, almost black. About 1/4 inch head that slowly dissolved.
S: Slight coffee aroma, but not too overpowering. 
T: Nice. Actually, very nice!!! Although the aroma of coffee wasn't too strong, the taste definitely had a nice coffee bite to it. A rich, although not bold, flavor with no aftertaste. 
M: Just enough carbonation present for a smooth feeling. There is even a hint of creaminess that appears after a few sips. 
Drinkability: Smooth. Extremely smooth. This beer goes down easy.
Additional Comments: I expected more on the coffee/aromatic end of this beer. I have heard so many good things about it. While it wasn't spectacular, it was a good beer that I will be more than willing to try again... But it is by no means a top contender for my favorite beer. 858 characterscirclenine, Dec 02, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The pour is what you'd expect of a fine imperial stout: incredibly dark, with a 1-finger tan head that sticks around and laces nicely.
Aroma? Sidebar: I had several brews by Dieu Du Ciel while on a business trip to Toronto, and some of my co-workers were drinking it from the bottle. Big Mistake! All of the DDC beers I've had have absolutely mind-blowing aromas. This beer is no exception. A huge nose of perfectly-roasted coffee, with enough roasted malt to round out the acidity. I could breathe this in all day.
The taste doesn't disappoint, either. The brothers hit the nail on the head - this isn't coffee, it's espresso, including that delicious crema. This brew is close to Dark Horse's Perkulator, but Perkulator is a Starbucks or Illi espresso compared to the perfectly-drawn shot that is Péché Mortel.
The mouth is full and round. There is a little bit of alcohol on the finish that helps wrap the experience of a sip up nicely.
Enough typing, I have beer to savor! 982 charactersdjmitche, Dec 01, 2010
4.49/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a thick inky black with a big light brown head that laces very well. 
The nose is unsurprisingly, dominated by a dark roasted coffee and a touch of smoke and tobacco. I could smell this all day. 
Up front, the taste follows the nose with a blast of strong black coffee which somehow doesn't overpower the palate, and is complemented by the burnt/roasted malt and bitter dark chocolate. Leading into the finish, the alcohol slowly rears its head and coincides with a moderately bitter and lightly lingering finish that's again, reminiscent of a nice cup of java. 
Full mouthfeel, slightly chewy, moderate carbonation which helps to cut the richness a bit. 
As has been stated, if you love coffee and love stouts, you absolutely have to try this one as it magnificently brings together the best of both worlds. 814 charactersMattyV, Nov 30, 2010

4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had this early on in the BeerQuest and reviewing it from notes. It was part of an epic evening at Amity Hall where I was joined by my buddy Karim. I mostly remember it blowing my mind a little bit more than the Jack & Ken's Black Barleywine had done a pint before.
The appearance is a dark ruddy black with a half finger head that's barely brighter brown. This baby means business. The lacing sustains throughout the glass with great legs. It's got an aroma of pure coffee/espresso with dark chocolate in delicate balance. 
But the taste really blows it out of the box (or... bottle?). It's like a train made out of coffee and you're standing on the tracks drinking it. I fell in love. There's sweet notes too, and they form together in the thick and rich mouth to create a lovely feel. Sits in the stomach and warms you up (hey, it was a note). There's enough carbonation to make it not be boring when matched with its full body.
I'm happy to get this review in while another bottle sits waiting for my Beer Secret Santa recipient. He'll be a lucky guy drinking this one. Plus it's like... Medusa, right? Badass. 1,116 charactersafksports, Nov 25, 2010

A: Pored into my pint glass, this stout pours a pitch black with a tan head. A simple looking stout with a lot of promise.
S: The aroma is excellent. Coffee infused espresso goodness! Heavy roasted background with some bitter chocolate notes. This one can make your mouth water.
T: This is espresso heaven. Heavy in the coffee, this stout also has roasted toffee notes, and notes of bitter chocolate. The finish leaves a coffee like biterness on the pallet.
MF: Mouthfeel is on the heavy side of medium, creamy, and a relative amount of thickness.
D: Drinkability is good. This brew is savory, and my glass is almost gone.
Overall, Peche Mortel is a fine example of a coffee infused stout, but others like it shine through. Wake and Bake by Terrapin comes to mind, as does Mokah by Southern Tier. This stout would do good in the cellar, or in a barrel, or aged with oak...anything that would give it more notes then coffee. I do, however, have thoroughly enjoyed this brew! 1,027 charactersTKEbeerman, Nov 24, 2010

Appearance, dark with a tan head, quite inviting.
Smell, good smell here, I expected the coffee to be the dominant aroma. Suprisingly some nice chocolate and toasted malt were also present.
Taste, not as big of a fan of this one, I think the coffee was not to my palete, a bit too sour and acidic.
Mouthfeel, a bit too thin to get a higher mark, not terrible but compared to FBS, not even fair.
Drinkability, with the sour acidic coffee, I am not sure I would want more than one.
Overall, I dont think I will be seeking this one out again. Its a bit pricey, and I that price it really should be better than mediocre. 696 characterspmoore311, Nov 23, 2010
4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Drank from a Founders snifter. The beer poured exceedingly black into the glass, with a minimal amount of head. Despite the lack of foam, as I moved the glass in a circular motion, the beer absolutely clung to the upper reaches, leaving a solid fine film of bubbles that slowly dissipated back into the beer leaving a good amount of lacing.
The beer smelled strongly of fresh-roasted coffee beans, dark sweet chocolate and roasted malt. Behind the upfront aromas there were hints of vanilla and bourbon 
The coffee flavor was definitely at the forefront, but it isn't at all overpowering. The dark coffee bean component is a very complimentary precursor to the expected deep roasted malt flavor. There are subtle traces of licorice, toffee and bourbon.
The beer felt silky smooth in my mouth, with a light but noticeable amount of carbonation. There was a chewy thickness to it. The flavors are pretty intense and quite enjoyable. I found it very drinkable. 960 characterssurlytheduff, Nov 21, 2010

I had this beer again this evening and I poured it into a clear pint glass. It poured to be very dark and also very thick with a very thin dark tan head which dissipated quickly.
I was happy to read in one of the other reviews that this beer is brewed with fair trade coffee. The smell was both of coffee and chocolate. It's a thick smooth stout which may be my favorite of it's kind (Founders Imperial Breakfast stout is a close second). 503 charactersChincino, Nov 21, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5A: The beer pours black, thick and syrup-like. The dark brown head was almost nonexistent. That's probably because I poured it very slowly as to not agitate it too much.
S: Chocolate and coffee aromas are very prevalent and wonderfully pungent. Dark roasted malts are sweet on the nose cover the subtle hop profile
T: Espresso, chocolate, molasses, roasted malts and bitter highlights that come through the first few layers. I think the coffee adds to the bitterness profile. Tannic and bitter finish with risidule roasted malts linger in the end.
M: Rich, thick and very chewy. Sticky and heavy on the tongue. It doesn't wash down quickly and hangs in the back of the mouth.
D: Even though it is very warm, sweet and inviting beer, it's not an every day beer at 9.5% avb. However, it's a mortal sin not to try one.

A: Poured a thick, dark brown, with a molasses consistency. The head was a few shades lighter than the beer itself.
S: High grade (Fair Trade), 100% grade A coffee, with a bit of candy sweetness.
T: Not only is the coffee piece of this beer amazing, it was also complemented brilliantly by a sort of pancake syrup-like sweetness. The bitterness comes.... then goes.... then comes .... then goes... etc. A complex coffee stout? Who knew that could be possible?!
M: Thicker than just about any thickness you could imagine, without any booze detected, and the gourmet coffee grounds killed the sweetness and then some. The carbonation was perfect for the style.
D: Was it as good as the Founder's "Breakfast Stout" series? Hmmm... that's a tough one. However, I think it would be really be cool to have a blind tasting involving all of those great beers and this one. I totally had coffee breathe after this thing, but it was all worth it! 1,067 charactersChaney, Nov 17, 2010

S: Dark coffee is the primary aroma, with a healthy dark chocolate compliment. A hint of booze maybe.
T: Oh my. Delicious dark chocolate leads off and espresso beans close. Both flavors are powerful and delicious. There's some dark malt in there too, and a noticeable kiss of hops underneath. The finish is bitter with coffee and a bit of those hops. Alcohol comes out a little as the beer warms, which works fine with the flavors. It's sweet, it's bitter, it's remarkable. Absolutely top notch.
M: Medium body for the style, but the carbonation is perfect for an imperial stout -- low but active. Very dry, similar to a cup of joe. Taste stays in your mouth forever.
D: Pricey bottle, but an absolutely remarkable beer. I'll buy it again and again. 932 charactersCharlatanSin, Nov 16, 2010

4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A - Very deep black colour that is almost entirely opaque. A little bit of ruby brown shows around the edges. The head is a nice creamy tan that creates a modest head while pouring and settles down to a thin film with a fairly tall ring around the edges.
S - Great smell. Roasted coffee and malts come through, along with dark chocolate. The alcohol is also apparent in the smell.
T - Fantastic. Dark chocolate and dark/roasted coffee with a strong but not off-putting wave of alcohol following the initial taste. The bitterness of the hops is there, co-mingling with the alcohol to provide a nice contrast to the sweetness of the initial drink and leaving an excellent aftertaste. This also means that sweetness doesn't accumulate and become a nuisance.
M/D - The mouthfeel of this beer is great. The weight and smoothness of the body makes swishing it around feel heavenly. While the alcohol is certainly present in the taste I still feel like I could gladly drink this all night (If only one could be so lucky). Therefore I give it high scores for drinkability. I've poured two of these into a snifter before and it was still great from start to finish, something impressive for a stout with a body and ABV of this weight. 1,228 charactersStarshipPoopers, Nov 11, 2010

Been wanting to try this for quite some time now. Saw it for the first time at Corvallis Brewing Supply and paid $5.65 for an 11.5 oz. bottle poured into a clear pint glass. No bottle dating evident.
A-Pours black with a one finger, creamy tan head with only modest retention and lacing.
S-Bittersweet chocolate and coffee beans, fair trade at that, the coffee at least. Doubt there is any real chocolate added to this brew, but the chocolate malt bill is definitely pronounced. I also get a faint hint of vanilla that is very nice. Improves as it warms.
T-Coffee. Coffee and bittersweet chocolate. More coffee. Enough infused coffee that I believe there should be a separate style. As an IS this is very good. As a coffee stout, this is the best I have had. I love coffee and beer, and beer and coffee. These go together better than chocolate and peanut butter. Taste improves as it warms.
M-Exceedingly smooth with a full, luxuriant body. Surprising for such a big beer at 9.5% ABV.
D-I liked this very much, but don't expect to buy again due to the price. Prefer AleSmith Speedway Stout and The Abyss to this for the price. I must admit, though, that I wish I had more now that is gone. 1,234 charactersvelosuds, Nov 07, 2010

Appearance - Beer pours a solid brown almost black colour. The pour is very thick in appearance. A light brown head is about 3 fingers deep.
Smell - Definite coffee based smell with alcohol mixed in. No doubt, it smells like an Imperial Stout!
Taste - WOW - what a taste! The bitterness is right from the beginning to the end. There is even a lingering bitterness. The beer has a strong alcohol and coffee taste, however, well balanced.
Mouthfeel - real nice level of carbonation adds to the overall taste. Beer is full on the pallet and offers added taste. This is what an imperial should be like.
Drinkability - I had to step back and evaluate this beer from a BA point. This is not my style, i would not stock this beer. But from a brewery side, they have made a great beer and really nailed it. 839 charactersSwedes21, Nov 06, 2010

A - Thick dark body with a nice brown head. Just what a stout should look like.
S - A good smell for an imperial stout, but I get more alcohol than coffee.
T - Perfect taste. The coffee comes through and the alcohol is very well hidden for 9.8%.
M - Perfect for an imperial stout.
D - I finished my one bottle surprisingly easy. It would be too strong to drink too much in a night, but this was definitely the easiest drinking Imperial Stout that I have ever had. 628 characterskwill, Nov 02, 2010

S - Sweet malts to start off with and then the subtleness of the coffee kicks in. The coffee aroma is fresh and not as bitter as some.
T - Lots more coffee in the taste than in the aroma and much more bitter (in a good way). Great malt backbone with rich black malts and toasted flavors.
M/D - Heavy body, low carbonation, and a dry finish from the coffee. The ABV is present if you are specifically looking for it otherwise it is mostly hidden. 581 charactersVaTechHopHead, Oct 26, 2010

S: Lots of chocolate and roast coming through. Dark roasted coffee with some cream mixed in too.
T: Big chocolate sweetness, char, some vanilla. Hoppy bitterness at the end. It may be me, but I'm not a fan of the heavy char that many coffee stouts are putting out. None of the coffee I drink tastes like that.
M: Gently agitating the sauce with my tongue turns this liquid in to a creamy treat. Good stuff.
D: Not bad, but the char is a tough off-putting. 611 charactersLazerlobe, Oct 25, 2010

4.17/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 412oz. bottle poured into an oversized tulip. Pours pitch black with 3 fingers of thick root beer style head which recedes to a ring of foam with some sticky lacing. Smells of coffee, chocolate, caramel and smoke. Smells bitter (if that's possible) and roasty. The taste is strong coffee, licorice, alcohol. The mouthfeel is perfect for an imperial stout, thick and chewy but not too heavy; the carbonation does not get in the way. Except for the hotness, I'd say the drinkability of this is fairly high; I'm betting a little age will make this a monster!
As an aside, this is a very good beer from the bottle. On tap at the brewpub, this is probably the most delicious beer I've ever tasted. If age improves these bottles, I will try to remember to re-rate. 758 charactersmrnobody, Oct 24, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Not as much of a head as I had hoped for, but the streaks of lace left behind by the ring of foam does have some staying power, but the glass is eventually left clean. The color is the proverbial used motor oil, super dark brown. 
As expected, the nose is mostly chocolaty, bitter coffee. As an added bonus it smells as if someone threw in a shot of Grand Marnier. The sweetness of the coffee smell comes across as some molasses. I hope it tastes as nice as it smells.
The taste is very similar to the smell except that the molasses abates, leaving a clean finish which is a great end to wonderfully silky smooth body. Even warmed up the bitterness is pretty strong, but that's a good thing here. The alcohol is almost undetectable...only shows as a slight burn at the back of the tongue... which makes this dangerous. It's delicious and I could drink one after the other, but I know I'd pay for it in the morning. 916 charactersNaugros, Oct 23, 2010

Id say this one has about a year on it or so. Pours a deep ruby brown color, near black. A large brown head creates lots of stickiness as it slowly dissipates. Burnt dark malts, bitter chocolate and roasted coffee beans, a slight vanilla note, grape jam? Prunes or figs maybe, a rich fruit note for sure is beginning to develop. Nice texture, good weight to it also. Mild in sweetness, the base flavors seem to be clashing a little bit, a bitterness at the end sticks around for a while followed a drying wave of alcohol, not too intense. A nice coffee stout for sure, but it doesnt even begin to compare to some of the other heavy hitters in the style. Would definitely drink again, id like to try a fresh bottle.

3.87/5  rDev -12%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours motor oil black with a one-finger head that drops to a tan-colored rimming of foam. Dominant aromas of bourbon, dark chocolate and roasted coffee.
Strong bitter opening with bites of semi-sweet baker's chocolate mid-palette. Suggestions of bourbon surface, followed by some 9.5% ABV heat. Intense waves of espresso rise to the forefront, before fading into extreme bitterness on the finish. 
Mouthfeel is thick and slick with understated effervescence. This Imperial is brewed for slow sippin' and the reflection that comes with it. And here's what I reflected upon: Damn good, yet not quite in the league of Central Water's Brewhouse Coffee Stout. Here, the coffee presence seems to reside behind an oppressive wall of hop and chocolate bitterness.
Then again, not giving it a second try would be considered a Mortal Sin. Would it not? 845 charactersCaptainIPA, Oct 19, 2010
4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A- Very dark brown to black in colour. Completely opaque. Poured Vigorously and no head; then a big foamy dark brown head came out of no where. Sunk down to a light lacing fairly quickly.
S- Strong coffee smell at the tip; like a very high quality Arabica coffee. Lots of dark chocolate smell also comes to the nose with a wonderful smoothness. A small hint of Vanilla is also detectable with the chocolate.
T- The coffee flavour is very strong with his one (geeky I know). It's like a coffee punch to the mouth. Very falvourful coffee which blends in perfectly with the light flavour of the malts. The chocolate flavour also molds into the coffee beautifully along with the light vanilla hints. Also very bitter from some hops that are detectable at the end of this very complex beer.
D- Very wonderful stout. All the complexities in this are very well paired, and the beer goes down very smooth. Not an everyday beer, but a beer that has to be had and every once and a while for sure. 989 characterscase4816, Oct 18, 2010

(I am moving and have no glassware) A great creamy, coffee colored head sits atop this black, black beer. I am shining my 10,000 lumen flashlight into this beer, but no light penetrates.
The smell is so strong. Roasty malts layered over coffee with a faint undertone of alcohol. 
Tastes like bitter roasts and broken coffee beans... In a good way. As you would expect, when the beer warms, the alcohol becomes more prevalent. A very "wow" taste smacks you in the face.
Thick, creamy mouthfeel. Like full cream milk, but delicious, dark beer instead.
This beer should be enjoyed on a chilly, winter afternoon as the sun drops below the treeline. If not for the almost 10% abv, this would rate higher.
Very enjoyable. 789 charactersKlgkenny, Oct 17, 2010

Bottle picked up from the LCBO, bottled in August 2010.
Poured into a Duvel goblet. Nearly pitch black, with a half inch of tan, frothy head. Leaves lovely swirls and island patches on the surface, a thick ring that retains well, and a few patches of lacing. Looks terrific.
The nose is rich in roasted espresso beans, toasted malts, cream, marshmallow, a touch of alcohol (bourbon and sherry) and mild hoppage as well.
The taste is a tremendous burst of espresso flavor, which attacks the tongue with vigor. As the brew warms a touch (and after the tastebuds acclimatize to all the espresso goodness), I'm also picking up some subtle notes of caramel, dark fruit, and just a touch of bourbon. The finish is surprisingly dry, boasting peppery hops and coffee bitterness. Although I can certainly detect the alcohol, it is warming and flavorful. Long, bitter finish.
Chewy, velvety, and with a fine, creamy carbonation, this brew is going down trememdously well. 
Once again, Montreal proves to be among the finest brewing cities. A fantastic brew, certainly well worthy of the hype (and the wait). One of the finest uses of coffee/espresso I've seen in a stout. Seriously, I'm almost getting a coffee buzz here, despite nearly being at 10% alcohol! About two bottles of this would be about all I can handle in an evening, but nevertheless, the drinkability for such a thick, hearty, high ABV stout is still high for me. I will most definitely be back for a few more for cellaring and extensive sampling on my part. 1,568 charactersJohnnyBarman, Oct 16, 2010

Pours a thick black with a foamy tan head which holds for a long while. Great retention and sticky lacing.
The nose is of roasted malts, molasses, strong coffee and dark chocolate. Getting a warm alcohol smell there too.
Big malt taste which is a heavy and chewy feel on the palette. Dank/resiny, warm sensation initially then a long finish with a bitter hop taste.
Overall this is one of the thickest heaviest stouts I've tried. Bold flavour which would seem to age well to tame some of the alcohol taste. 9.5% puts this as a sipper and a stand alone brew. 621 charactersheebes, Oct 15, 2010

Let it out on a snifter and it pour a dark black brew with a brown creamy crown. Awesome on the nose with aromas of dark roasted coffe, roasted malts and dark cocoa beans. An exact mirror copy on the palate. Firts off is the not overpowering dark coffe followed by the bitter roasted malts and finishig it off with the dark cocoa beans that gives it a perfect finish, with a nice chocolately aftertaste that lingers on smoothly. Great drinkability, very refreshing. Taste even better a little bit warmer. 675 charactersMeMyselfNAles7, Oct 11, 2010

A - Dark black with a finger of foamy light brown head.

3.19/5  rDev -27.5%look: 2 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 3.5This beer poured absolutely pitch black with no chance of light permeating through. However, even with a relatively aggressive pour, it turned up almost no head. There was a brief appearance of a dark tan head, less than a centimeter thick, but quickly faded away, leaving a thin ring around the beer but no foam or lace. 
Aroma was weak at first, but as it warmed the notes of espresso started to come out. There was a notable roasted character, but I really had to get close to find it. Not nearly as strong as I would have expected. 
Coffee is obviously the dominant flavor, but its not over done. While this may be the coffee-est beer I've ever had, there is still room for flavors to come from the roasted barley. Overall, it's quite an enjoyable flavor, except for a not-so-pleasant bitterness in the finish. Its the kind of bitterness you get from burnt coffee, not just a dark roast, but a truly burnt cup of coffee. 
Mouthfeel was smooth but rather thin with almost no sense of carbonation. I often find stouts to not have a lively carbonated feel, but this felt almost completely flat. 
Drinkability was probably the highlight of this beer. Even though it looked and felt almost flat, the flavor was tasty enough that I could still drink it. 1,255 charactersKinsman, Oct 10, 2010
3.78/5  rDev -14.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured from the bottle with a deep, luxurious chocolate brown under a billowy beige head of densely-packed micro bubbles. The aroma is fairly light and clean, with notes of bittersweet chocolate, a dark roasted malt sweetness, a bit of a mineral quality, and only a faint hint of coffee. The flavor is much more aggressive, but it still doesn't scream coffee for me. The flavor is more of a standard imperial stout, with characteristics of charred malts, bitter chocolate, maybe a bit of black licorice. The coffee is certainly there, but it comes out subtly at first before becoming more prominent in the achingly bitter finish. The texture is smooth but resinous, and although not tremendously boozy, it is easy to tell that this beer is potent. 747 charactersdevilben02, Oct 08, 2010

A- Dense, black, and thick looking pour. Much like a thick coffee, except for the nice brown head sitting atop the beer. Got about 3/8 inch of head, which isn't bad for a 9.5 beer.
S- Coffee.... and roasted barley. Slightly smoky. A tickle of bitter hops... can't make out the type... but they're masked by the roastiness.
T- Delicious. Coffee. Roasted barley. A hint of malt sweetness in an attempt to wrap some caramel into the mix. VERY NICE. Did I mention coffee?
M- About what you'd expect from a 9.5 beer. It isn't dry. It leaves some of the flavor on the tongue. 
D- I always end up rating these high gravity beers lower on drinkability. Just because I don't really feel you can say this is a ultra-drinkable beer. Not because it isn't delicious, just because of the assault on the taste buds. They get tired after one or two of these.
Very nice beer overall. Not my favorite Imperial Stout, but very very good. 968 charactersIcehouse57, Oct 07, 2010

Pours a perfect pitch black, couple fingers of tan/mocha head. Fantastic retention, and excellent lace. Nose is the epitome of roastiness, dark chocolate and espresso. Huge coffee notes, and I'm sensing a bit of the alkeehawl in the background. Taste follows to a degree, blast of the rich roastiness is the initial impression. More espresso than you can imagine here, the coffee is almost overpowering; I almost get a sense of some cream or milkiness, can't tell if I'm fabricating this because of the mouthfeel or if this flavour is actually present. Regardless, alcohol isn't hidden by any stretch, well known as this hits the back of my throat. Definite creaminess and fullness in the mouth, slick as can be and just coats every part of my mouth, but finishes dry and bitter (coffee bitterness). Thick, fat and sludgy perfection. Drinkability takes a bit of a hit, chances are I couldn't sit down for more than a couple of these but that more a function of the ABV than the beer itself. Exceptional stuff. 1,220 charactersliamt07, Oct 07, 2010

4.17/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A - Pitch black with deep mahogany hues. A little above average sized, frothy, sticky, sandy colored head. Good retention leaving behind a very nice layer of lace.
S - Heavy coffee aroma with a sweeter coffee aroma starting off which then gives way to a rich black espresso aroma. Some tart dark fruit/anise aroma also comes out in the end. A bit of roasted/burnt bitter aroma along with hints of chocolate. That said, coffee dominates the nose.
T - Similar to the nose with coffee overpowering the other flavors. Rich, dark espresso and and sweeter, creamy coffee flavors mix and fade in and out with each other. Some roasted malt flavors come out along with just a hint of bittersweet chocolate. Some slightly tart anise flavor is present in the background toward the finish of the sip. Also has a bit of an earthy bitterness as well.
M - Fuller side of medium body with a healthy amount of carbonation. Very smooth, silky and creamy. Nice body and feel.
D - Pretty drinkable, although the coffee does get to be a little much. Alcohol is very well hidden and it doesn't get too bitter or sweet.
Notes: Definitely a coffee forward beer. Sometimes the coffee flavors are sweeter and other times they are more roasted and bitter. Overall I liked it but didn't love it, and it just seemed a little out of balance. I would definitely have it again, but with the price I don't know when I would buy it again. Definitely worth trying, especially if you love coffee. 1,465 charactersFreshHawk, Oct 05, 2010

The head is tan colored and retains what seems like forever, starting out as a frothy half inch layer, with really fine bubbles, and settling to a thick, dense layer over the brew, which includes puffy clouds of clumpy foam. The lacing is perfect, clinging without even trying in all sorts of fine strings. Very nice looking indeed!
S- Well, I'm not a coffee drinker, but I do love the smell of fresh beans, which this brew has lots of....with a slight hint of vanilla extract mixed in, softening the aroma somewhat. In the background, there are notes of fresh unsweetened chocolate as well as the burnt chocolate malt to sweeten it up somewhat. The finish is actually somewhat meaty/smoky in character rather than a hop bitterness.
T- Wow, this in an intensely flavored beer. Imagine everything I mentioned in the aroma and multiply it by 10! The coffee comes through immediately and is quite dominant, but is smoother than the aroma lets on. The fresh cocoa is sweetened up just slightly with cream and has some very dark raisined fruits....very rich indeed. The finish lingers on with resins of bitter coffee grounds, Espresso and/or an Americano on the palate. Very intense, and very unique!
M- This is full bodied and is very similar to a thick, reduced version of an strong espresso. The carbonation is creamy and the bubbles are fine. Truly reminds me of a strong coffee, as the alcohol is well hidden....there is no way that the 9.5% alc/vol is noticeable...just a very silky smooth brew!
D- This intensely flavored, coffee infused beer is very good, and I recommend having this as a sipping brew rather than something that you drink in large swallows. It really needs a strong cheese to go with it and I think it would be at it's prime with some food. On it's own....very good but I'm done after 1 bottle as it's a very powerful brew. I now know why this beer is rated as the best Canada has to offer....it's superb! 2,074 charactersChrisCage, Oct 03, 2010

A-Ink black with a thin ring of milk chocolate colored head. Looks promising!
S-Cold coffee,a light boozy aroma.
T/M-Oh yeah! This is awesome. Very simple and straight to the point. Coffee, coffee, and more coffee. There are some nice, roasty malts mid-palate to hold it together. The 9.5%ABV provides a pleasant warmth on the back of the throat, but this is dangerously drinkable.Mouthfeel is thin and concentrated at first, edging up to a medium-bodied, fairly smooth finish. One of the best coffee stouts I've had to date.

9.5% ABV
OG?
IBUs?
11.5 oz bottle with a twist-off cap (odd!) and no freshness date poured into big Brandy snifter on September 27, 2010. The guy at the store had told that it was very fresh
Appearance 4.5/5
Pours clear and very dark brown, and looks pitch black in the glass. The head is thick, creamy, dark brown with good retention, but minimal lacing.
Aroma 4/5
Coffee, chocolate, and sweet malts in plenty. No hops.
Taste 4/5
Acidic and fruity coffee notes with some malty sweetness, but the balance is decidedly towards bitter coffee. Medium finish with plenty of roast and a long, luxurious roasty aftertaste, full of coffee bitterness. Warming, but never boozy. Similar to Founders Breakfast Stout, this stout is all about coffee.
Mouthfeel 4.5/5
A bigger body won't hurt this beer and less carbonation would probably make it silkier. This one would be sublime on cask!
Drinkability 5/5
The 9.5% ABV never bothers, yet the body and finish are suitable for this style and alcohol. Very good.
Other
A fine beer, and a treat for coffee lovers. Between this and Founders Breakfast, I will go with the latter because of the price, but that doesn't alter the scores! 1,189 characterstewaris, Sep 28, 2010

Pours pitch black with a half finger tan head. The head lingers with strange bubble pockets with lacing providing circular foam globules around the glass.
There is plenty of coffee in the nose next to sweet malts. I also get some ashtray smell (in a good way), chocolate, roasty notes, and scents of liquors. The heat from this brew stings my nose.
Subtle sweet malts up front which gives way to tobacco and earth. A big does of coffee comes in at the end adding acidity and bitterness. If the earth made a beer, this would be it...it is very earthy. The flavor profile changes throughout the sip and finishes with a good amount of heat.
This is very lovely in the mouth and smooth on the tongue. There is a bit of sting throughout with a nice drying in the end.
This is a solid drinker and I have not had anything like it. I would recommend this unique brew to all beer lovers. 996 charactersTCgoalie, Sep 28, 2010
4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Enjoyed with TCGoalie and TCHopCraver. Thanks to TCGoalie for supplying the beer.
Appearance: Pours a syrupy brown with a tan, one-finger head. Lots of bubbling activity for a stout; almost looks like a witch's mini beer cauldron (if witches made beer). Decent head retention and lacing. After the head recedes, there are big bubble pockets riding on the surface of the beer. Because of the amount of carbonation, this one is very excitable when gyrated (that's what she said).
Smell: Hot, boozy oak and chocolate. Bourbon, molasses, and a burnt tobacco smell are also present. I'm also getting some coffee and dark fruits, with maybe a touch of vanilla extract rounding things out.
Taste: The first thing that came to my mind was biting into a tree. The palate starts off sweet and creamy, but evolves quickly into an oak flavor, and eventually ending with bitter coffee. Finishes dry, but the alcohol sticks with you for a while and works all of your tongue's "erogenous zones."
Mouthfeel: Pretty full-bodied. Starts creamy and ends quite bitter. Coffee bitterness is sustained throughout, but is most pronounced at the end.
Drinkability: Very delicious and well-balanced, but probably more of a sipper. 1,210 charactersBuckyFresh, Sep 25, 2010

T- sweet cocoa, coffee and cream. Complex layers of dark roasted malts and dates. Some molasses and brown sugar. 
M- full bodied with a bit of chew and stick. Mid level small bubbled carb.

4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours opaque black with not a whole lot of carbonation in this bottle. This has to be one of the darkest stouts out there. It has a small deep mocha colored head. The head quickly dissipates and leaves just a small ring around the edge of the glass, and leaves splashy lace.
The aroma is laden with rich coffee, dark chocolate (I mean dark, like 85% cocoa), smoky tobacco, toasted almonds and some earthy burnt smells.
The flavor is quite similar with tons of rich crushed coffee beans dominating. More dark chocolate, smoke and charred wood make their way past the immense coffee flavor, as well as toasted nutty flavors and some vanilla notes. This stout does not come off as sweet at all, just rich and roasty. It is pretty incredible how much coffee flavor they packed into it, and at the same time how easy it is to appreciate the supporting cast of flavors.
The mouthfeel is medium and seems to finish somewhat dry with a bit of a burnt astringency. It leaves some nice bitter coffee and chocolate flavors that linger on the tongue.
Not only is this a world class stout, but it really has a uniqueness to it that I appreciate. Drinking this is a lot like drinking fine iced coffee, but with pleasant beer characteristics as well. I found it to be quite drinkable with none of the ABV showing through at all. This beer lives up to its reputation. 1,355 characterszoso1967, Sep 25, 2010

Aroma: Dark chocolate and chocolate malt upfront w/ coffee overnotes. Light roasted malt rounding out in the background. Light alcohol warmth coming off of the nose as well. No hop aromatics / esthers. 
F: Sweet / Bitter chocolate malt upfront, followed by an intense roasted malt and coffee flavor that carries through to the finish. No hop flavor. The balance is dominant coffee 80/20 to the chocolate malt.
M: Heavy bodied and medium heavy mouthfeel on the verge of viscous. Light creaminess. Light alcohol warmth. 
O: Finely crafted and a great recipe. Highly enjoyed upon the recommendations of so many that I know. My only beef is with the mouthfeel and head development and retention. Had to pour aggressively to get the head to form up and wasn't very apparent. With a heavier dose of head and creamier mouthfeel, this would be perfect IMO. Otherwise outstanding in every other category. 1,018 charactersadkirkish, Sep 25, 2010
4.05/5  rDev -8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Melted French chocolate with wisps of vanilla, roasted mocha java coffee, milk chocolate brown head, scattered lace, black as pen ink body. Taste...dark chocolate followed by coffee...followed by roasted barley...followed by a dominating bitter alcohol kick in the back. The finish to me is just too intense for some reason. Maybe its the combination of bitter coffee, burnt malt and alcohol, but it kicks harder than some 11% and above stouts I have had. Finish aside, the ingredients somehow manage to showcase their uniquely enjoyable qualities while managing to be integrated; nevertheless there is some astringency. The low to medium carbonation accentuated the oily, medium-bodied, velvet-like mouth feel. So smooth..A solid coffee stout for sure. 753 charactersTheJollyHop, Sep 22, 2010

4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Reviewed on 8/28/10 prior to attending the Traverse City Microbrew Festival. Thanks, TCGoalie for this treat. Split two 11.2 oz. bottles between TCGoalie, BuckyFresh, and myself.
A: I think this is the prettiest stout that I've seen. It pours nearly pitch black with a nice 1 finger, mocha head into my very large snifter. The head was like the top of a carboy as beer is fermenting - tumultuously bubbly. The lacing is splashy and sticky. 
S: Big coffee notes at first, backed up by a dark chocolate and alcoholic heat in my nostrils. Some tobacco and leather undertones are also present. This is a big and creamy smelling beer. I am also smelling hazelnut, amaretto, kahlua, and lots of vanilla in Peche Mortel.
T: Right as the beer hits the tip of my tongue, I get a nice cigar smoke character, which is complemented by a lovely biting, acidic coffee flavor throughout the sip. In the middle of each draught, the rich, creamy, and sweet flavors cascade onto the middle of my palate. Then at the end of each sip, that acidic coffee taste reemerges from the background. This is a very earthy taste. 
M: There is a lot going on here - a great bite on the sides of my mouth throughout, while the middle of the sip reveal a full, rich, creaminess. Those two feels balance each other wonderfully.
D: This is a very complex beer that I will certainly have again. The heavy bitterness does knock it down just a wee bit for me, though, as I wouldn't want to have too much in a sitting. 1,484 charactersTCHopCraver, Sep 20, 2010

S: Smells of sweet roasted malts, caramel, chocolate, and coffee notes with a hint of vinous fruit as well.
T: Tastes of sweet roasted malts, deeper more burnt malts, coffee, chocolate, and some caramel as well. As it warms the flavors start to come more to life

4.78/5  rDev +8.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A- Iced coffee look. Dark black with beautiful creamy head.
S- Mocha and coffee, a small hint of vanilla. Pretty much an espresso aroma. It was great, but a bit too faint.
T- Coffee and mocha at the front and shots of espresso. Tasted like it even had the cream in it. The alcohol is almost completely hidden. Tastes like what I'd like my coffees to taste like in the morning.
M- Medium body and full feeling, but goes down a bit watery.
D- Extremely drinkable. Everybody who likes coffee would probably like this, and then quite a few more. Will absolutely be having this beer again. 12oz was not enough for me. I'd very much love to get a bomber.
One year after reviewing, this has come out again and I've done a side by side. The year old bottle seems to have really opened up. The fresh stuff tastes somewhat one dimensional in comparison. Strangely enough a lot of the coffee is still present in the year old bottle, although it doesn't have the bitter bite it had before. The booziness takes on more of a licorice taste after a year or so and it furthers the complexity. 
Ultimately, I think the tap version is optimal, and that a year of age slightly edges out the fresh. Regardless, I think that whatever form this beer is in, it won't cease to amaze. 1,265 charactersBBP, Sep 18, 2010
4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I've had this many times, and I looove it. Can't believe I've never reviewed it before.
It pours with a nice thick dark 1 finger fluffy head that leaves some memory of lacing on the sides. The beer is essentially pitch black, and leaves some nice legs on the sides of the glass.
THe nose brings all the great stuff you would expect. Lots of dark malts, some caramel, plenty of roasted barley, some chocolate, bakers chocolate and a little bitter dark chocolate. It has a slight sweetness aroma to it as well, accentuated by some caramel and hint of vanilla. There is some oatmeal as well, and a creamy touch. Also got plenty of coffee, and earthy fresh roasted somewhat dark roasted coffee bean. Even a hint of some spicy earthy hops, but not much. 
Taste is transcending! Creamy, with a slight chocolate milk, plenty of dark and bakers chocolate. Also lots of malts, plenty of roasted barley, chocolate malt, and some crystal malt. A little caramel flavor and some sweetness, but not a lot. More oatmeal blends with the creamy taste. It does have a slight minerality flavor from the roast, but is very manageable for the heavieness of the beer. It's got some bitterness, a little from the roast and some light earthy hops I think. Also the coffee is there, some nice earthy soil like roasted coffee, but the coffee flavor is lower. It's pretty rich and thick, creamy, smooth, delicate on the tongue but clings to the mouth. The finish comes with more of the smooth luscious feel and taste, with a little stickiness to the mouth. More bitterness comes through, with slight hops and plenty of earthy roast bitterness. Unfortunately the minerality and salty brine quality comes through more on the finish. A slight warming booze as well, but that is very manageable for 9.5%. 
The mouth is nice and rich, pretty thick, smooth and creamy, with decent carbonation.
It doesn't have the best drinkability. It does get help for drinking like a 6-7% abv beer and not 9.5, but the bitterness comes out a little too much, and the briny salty flavor takes quite a bit from it. It also doesn't cling to the mouth as much as I expected, which also helps the drinkability. Althought, I think the age of this one helps, being about 1.5 to 2 years old, so it doesn't drink as hot as a fresh one would. 2,290 charactersjlindros, Sep 18, 2010

A: Pours a deep black with a nice dark tan head that fades to a ring leaving a bit of lacing.
S: The nose is so complex with notes of chocolate milk, coffee, fudge, and vanilla. 
T: The taste is dark roasted coffee at first which leads to a bakers chocolate and vanilla finish. This almost tastes like it's barrel aged but of course it's not.
M: The feel is creamy but slightly thin for the style. Always seems like some coffee imperial stouts are thinner than regular imperial stouts. 
D: Highly drinkable besides the high abv. I'd drink it again if I had access to this.
If you like coffee stouts this is a must try. It really reminded me of Terrapin Wake-N-Bake and GI BCCS. Although I might go after the Terrapin first due to price. 793 charactersGregSVT, Sep 17, 2010

S: Espresso, cinnamon, and some alcohol heat on the nose. Nice balance, and nice intensity of the smell.
T: Intense coffee flavors up front, that border on being overwhelming. Probablly more coffee flavor than any other coffee stout I have had. Thankfully they fade into dark fruits and chocolate. While this starts of pretty bold, it finishes smooth.
M: The mouthfeel was the most underwhelming part of this beer for me. Just too thin for my expectations in a . Decent aftertaste and carbonation though.
D: Not the most drinkable coffee stout I have had, but not that bad either. Overall this seems more like an exercise of how much coffee can you get in a beer. It's almost like drinking a cup of coffee with some schnapps added or something. Interesting, but not overly drinkable. This is the first beer that I can honestly say I'd be intrigued to try ABOVE room temperature. 1,013 charactersglazeman, Sep 15, 2010

4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Delicious coffee stout. This one is up there with Speedway and Beer Geek Breakfast for me. 
It's a good looking beer. Jet black with a foamy, brown head. It actually has to be pretty thin before the liquid shows brown. 
The aroma isn't as full of coffee as expected. There's actually quite a bit of creamy chocolate in there. It smells like a scoop of chocolate ice cream splashed with a shot of espresso. Unfortunately, it's a bit weak compared to the other components of the beer.
The taste has more coffee. It's actually almost overpowered by coffee, but it's an excellent coffee flavor. There's some roast, chocolate and a bit of lactic flavor, as well. The beer would probably be fairly sweet if it wasn't for the bitterness of the coffee. 
Mouthfeel is velvety and thick. It fits the beer well and helps the flavors along nicely. It's quite drinkable, and I'm not someone who usually takes well to lots of caffeine in my coffee stouts (and this one definitely has a lot of caffeine). It's just such a good coffee flavor with such a rich, smooth feel that the jitters aren't too noticeable. 1,099 characterspopery, Sep 12, 2010

Huge, tight, creamy, light brown head covering an absolutely pitch black body. Immense rings of lacing left by each sip on the glass. The head remains fully intact throughout the entire experience. Intense fresh roast coffee aroma, accompanied by French Vanilla, sweet chocolate, and some smoke. Taste is, wow, amazing if you even remotely like the taste of coffee. Naturally sweetened coffee up front followed by a chocolaty and coffee bitterness, with a light brandy aftertaste. Best tasting cold espresso that I have ever had. Thick, syrupy, mouthcoating mouthfeel, with light, playful bubbles. Alcohol is well hidden. Great stout! 706 charactersBMan1113VR, Sep 10, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 412oz bottle poured into a pint glass
Appearance - The beer pours a dark brown, almost black colour with an average size frothy and fizzy light brown head. It looked like syrup coming out the bottle, very thick for a beer. I can't see much carbonation due to the colour of the beer. There is some great lacing and the head lasted for a while.
Smell - I can smell some chocolate, coffee, caramel
Taste & Mouth - The beer actually has a decent amount of carbonation on the tongue, but it still feels thick and velvety. Most noticeable is the coffee and chocolate flavours, also some hops and a peppery spice mix. The beer actually left my lips and mouth with a warm and tingling feeling. Perhaps cinnamon and cloves? It ends with a bitter coffee bean aftertaste.
Drink - potent stuff, lots of coffee flavour.. best to be drank with small sips after a meal. At 9.5%, it hides the alcohol very well. Another great beer from Dieu Du Ciel. 936 charactersspinrsx, Sep 09, 2010
4.07/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Found this single at The Andersons Market off of Sawmill in Columbus.
Wow, after prying off the cap I saw that this was a twist off... something slightly off-putting about that.
Dark black stout, with a rich toffee head of roughly 3/4 a finger. Thick legs of lace ooze slowly down from the blanket around the rim from my initial pour.
Smells delightful! Rich, full-bodied coffee scent. Slightly sweet. Some vanilla, hazelnut, and chocolate. Roasted and bready, this is a complex stout so far...
The flavor is not quite as good. I have seen this pretty readily compared to Founders Breakfast Stout, and I must say that this isn't quite as balanced or desirable. This is, however, still a world-class coffee stout nonetheless. Light notes of dark roasted coffee, then bam! a slap in the face by the alcohol. Up front, and burning all the way down, this is drinking strong for 9.5%. I'd say that the alcohol is likely the biggest reason I prefer Founders. The finish is full of coffee bitterness and a light hop prickle on the tongue. Only faintly sweet, the dark malt rounds out the bill.
Medium bodied, this is smooth and pleasant the swish in the mouth. Lightly carbonated, and loads of sticky dryness left behind.
This is certainly a beer I'd be happy to buy again. The alcohol is still a little higher than I'd prefer, if only because it masks some of the amazing flavor in this brew. 1,392 charactersSpider889, Sep 08, 2010

Pours jet black with a small toffee colored head. Lacing is the best I've seen and swirls nicely in a snifter. It has a very strong smell of roasted coffee beans and smells nothing like beer. While I am not a coffee drinker, it tastes, to me, like black coffee with a dark chocolate fusion. There is an ever so slight alcohol bite at the finish, but it seems impossible to be a 9.5% brew. It is extremely smooth and only got better when I let it get to room temperature. I could see this become a regular purchase for me and I only wish I took the time to visit Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel while in Montreal two months ago. Fantastic. 669 charactersVaison, Sep 07, 2010

M - Medium bodied... A slightly fizzy carbonation... Slightly chewy... Slightly lush... Really great mouthfeel that proves a great stout doesn't need to be overly chewy, overly viscous or overly thick... 
D - An exemplary American Double Stout that also doubles as one of the best coffee added brews out there... I didn't know Canadians knew their coffee or their beer - I was proven wrong on both fronts... A terrific treat for both coffee and beer lovers... 1,245 charactersphilbe311, Sep 07, 2010

Pitch black with 1/2" tan colored head that quickly dissipated leaving a nice ring.
I love the espresso, chocolate and caramel tones.
Sweet, creamy, roasty... this may be the creamiest stout I have ever had. 
Fantastic. 272 charactersncaudle, Sep 05, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.511.5oz bottle served in an oversized wineglass.
pours a deep, very dark brown that borders on black; a finger of tannish/cinnamon toned head the dissipates somewhat quickly but leaves decent lacing.
smells delicious. big, robust coffee aroma with strong notes of chocolate and roasted malts. very impressive.
the aroma profile follows through in the taste; lots of coffee, espresso, and dark chocolate. has a bit of a bitter finish, could be the hops. well hidden 9.5% ABV. 
medium to upper medium body with middling carbonation; creamy. very drinkable.
bottom line: this is a tasty, tasty coffee stout and i'm really enjoying it. that said, IMO it has so much stiff competition within the style that it falls shy of the upper eschelon. would love to try one bourbon bbl aged. 781 charactersperrymarcus, Sep 05, 2010

S: Huge coffee aroma. A little boozy and medicinal.

M: Syrupy but I think the flavor makes me think it's more so than it really is. Maybe a little too much carbonation.

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.511.5 oz on clearance from Groton Market
I was a little skeptical of trying this one at first as one, I'm not really into (most) stouts and two, my experices with French beer is forever tarnished by Fischer beer (wow that shit sucks), granted these are not valid reasons.
Anywho, instead of doing a typical paced review where I would go by appearance, aroma etc in order, I snuck a quick sip in after I poured it.
Goddamit was I suprised. The taste is like a kick in the face, in a good way. Delicious coffee malts and beans up front turning over into a chocolate aftertaste. A little grassy in the middle, could be the hops. A little bit of alcohol warmth on the breath.
Yeah the aftertaste is almost like an espresso flavored ice cream.
This beer is a treat. Looks beautiful and pours nicely. Would be a great beer to have ice cream with I think. 852 charactersAARomanov, Sep 01, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4(Vintage 2009) Poured from an 11.5oz. bottle into a wine goblet.
Deep, dark black in color with a short head of tan foam
Aroma-Heady whiff of dark roasted coffee-like putting your nose in a just-opened can of dark roast coffee.
Taste-Full-on dark roast robust coffee, dark chocolate, dry espresso finish with some warming alchohol. Strong coffee flavor throughout, with an underlying backbone of fermented dark fruit. Huge character and very well-balanced. Each sip takes you to a different level of flavor. I would love to try this beer fresh to see if the flavors would be even more intense. As it is, this brew would be the perfect fireside "closer" on a cool evening. Sip, savor, and enjoy. S'mores anyone? 710 charactershosehead83, Aug 30, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: As dark as a starless night. This brew is a deeply opaque black color with a huge tan head that lasts until the bottom of the glass.
Smell: The aroma of this brew screams Espresso. Fresh espresso beans, fresh espresso coffee, FRESH ESPRESSO! There are also some nice milk chocolate, caramel, and roasted malt notes hidden beneath the mound of espresso beans.
Taste: This brew tastes like a dream (a WET DREAM). First the fresh espresso notes hit hard, followed by a nice dark chocolate flavor. Than the roasted malts and the subdued but creamy caramel-like sweetness come into play in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Smooth as silk and as creamy as a milkshake. This is one of the best beers I have EVER had, but I LOVE coffee! 
Drinkability: How can a 9% abv espresso assault be this easy to drink. This is easily the easiest drinking coffee beer that I have ever consumed. In fact this is one of the easiest drinking strong stouts that I have ever had as well.
Seriously, if you can get this.... GET THIS!!! 1,017 charactersbigdonniebrasco, Aug 29, 2010
4.13/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Serving type - Bottle
APpearance - Dark black with slight tanness
Smell - Classic stout smell. Coffee, chocolate, malts, and some spices
Taste - Strong coffee and malt flavor starts off this stout. Some mollasses and alcohol mixed in to give this a kick. Also i get a hint of fruit and nut flavor with all the coffee.
Mouthfeel - Nice and bold. Will cover your whole mouth with its strong coffee and malts. Drink this first cause it will require all your tastebuds
Drinkability - One of the best. The first few drinks i was having a hard time with the unique coffee afteraste but by the end of the bottle i was loving it. This is pricey so id view this as a speciality, or holiday treat. Check this one out 711 characterswvsabbath, Aug 28, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 411.5oz Bottle into a Tulip
Pours pitch black with a thin tan head. Leaves slight lacing on the glass. No light escapes, even when held to the light. 
Sweet roasted malts and bitter coffee poke through the aroma, combining into an inviting nose. I'd love for my coffee maker to fill my house with this aroma in the morning. 
Taste is heavy and fairly complex for a coffee stout. Big roasted malts come through upfront, carrying a smooth coffee bitterness that lingers on the tongue. This beer is an artful representation of the coffee stout subgenre. 
Mouth is smooth and silky. Heavy enough not to be watery, but not so heavy that it feels like oil. 
This beer is a joy to drink. From the aroma to the aftertaste, everything comes together perfectly. 755 charactersmondegreen, Aug 25, 2010
4.54/5  rDev +3.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5A limited relase at the LCBO this past winter. A big thanks to my friend Jill for picking up a few for me while they were around. Cheers! 
From a bottle into a snifter. 
APPEARANCE: A black pour produces a small, medium looking tan head that quickly fades to a wisp and ring. Jet black body with zero carbonation evident. A wisp and ring remains until the end but leaves no real lacing down the glass. 
SMELL: Roasted malts, smokiness, and a good dose of roasted coffee beans. Bold aromas. Hints of black licorice and dark chocolate as well. Definitely a complex nose for a coffee stout. 
TASTE: Very well blended flavors here. Roasted malts again, with roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate and hints of vanilla, all working well together. Sweet toffee and caramel covered chocolate on the finish, balanced with some more bitter coffee beans. A mild yet very long lasting aftertaste is bitter-sweet with an array of flavors. Simply wonderful. 
PALATE: Medium body with higher levels of carbonation than expected. Creamy on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes slightly mouth-coating. Alcohol undetectable. 
OVERALL: Completely worth the high ratings. The head could perform a little better and the palate could be a bit bigger, but the flavors and aroma are world class. A very complex and flavorful imperial coffee stout. Hopefully the LCBO will make this a regular release every winter. Thanks for picking some of these up for me Jill! 1,448 charactersJeffo, Aug 25, 2010
3.98/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Got this at South Bay Drugs...my first time in there this past weekend.
12 oz bottle poured into my snifter glass. There are notches at 2 and 4, so I'm guessing this is batch 24. No idea when it was bottled.
A - Black with about a half finger width of mocha colored head. Some nice lacing is left on glass.
S - Lots of roast mixed with coffee, maybe some espresso, and bitter chocolate. I may get a slight whiff of oak too. The coffee smell seems to be the dominant thing going on here.
T - There are nice roasty malts that mix with coffee pretty nicely. Compared to something like Speedway Stout, it seems a bit one dimensional to me, but for what it is, it's pretty good.
M - Maybe a slightly more than medium body with kind of a high to medium carbonation...my tongue is left prickly. I'm not a big fan of my stouts having that much carbonation, and I like them, especially imperial stouts, to be thicker.
D - I am definitely enjoying it. It's a good/solid stout, but not upper echelon, in my humble opinion. I wouldn't turn it down, but I wouldn't seek it out either. 1,077 charactersKaiser81, Aug 25, 2010

S: coffe beans, slight bitter chocolate, very sweet and roasty.

M: Decent mouthfeel. Could be a little thicker for this style. I like my Imperial Stouts chewy.
D: Pretty good here. Im not having trouble drinking it. It drinks pretty nice.

4.28/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 11.5oz. bottle marked Batch 17 which was bottled on September 8, 2009 into a snifter...
A - Pours a completely opaque black. One of the blackest I've seen. A nice one finger tan head forms and sits for about a minute before it recedes to a nice tan lacing.
S - Delicious roasted coffee up front followed by some roasted malts. Surprising amount of coffee aroma considering this one is almost a year old. There are some great bittersweet chocolate notes that follow these monster notes.
T - Much more subdued coffee flavor than when this one is fresh, but still a great roasted coffee bean flavor is present. Some delicious bittersweet or mil chocolate is mixed in as well. Judging how sweet this one it, it could be milk chocllate. Some roasted malts mix in well with everything else that is going on. A very bold, roasty stout.
M - Smooth and creamy with a perfect amount of carbonation. Really excellent mouthfeel.
D - Extremely drinkable for a 9.5 ABV Imperial Stout. This is my favorite beer (flavor and drinkability mixed together) I have ever tried and it constantly amazes me. Almost near perfect for me. 1,130 charactersKAP1356, Aug 20, 2010
4.08/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Typical blackish/dark-brown with a long lasting tannish head.
S - Huge coffe with a lot of dark malts roastiness. Slight caramel and a little bit of earthy hop aromas.
F/M - Big dark malts, roasted and burnt with a pronounced coffee flavor. Smooth bitterness accentuated by the dark malts (editor's note: I know I say that a lot, but that it a key component to many American/Imperial stouts). Medium bodied; I prefer a bigger body on coffee-based stouts.
D - very good. This is a clean-finishing beer that has a lot of depth and complexity behind it. Certainly not something you need a special occasion to sip on, but definitely a great beer to quaff.
Overall this is a great beer, and a must-try. 705 charactersdomtronzero, Aug 19, 2010

A: Pours jet-black with a dense cappuccino colored foam head the slowly faded into a bubbly film. Faint spots of soapy lace were left in the wake.
S: Coffee! Smells of fresh roasted coffee beans, dark roasted malt, and maybe just a hint of dark fruit such as fig. There is a slight coffee acidity to the smell along with a faint metallic twang. Light notes of alcohol vapor poke through the strong coffee scent as well. 
T: Very rich and delicious flavors. Tastes just like drinking thick, roasted coffee. There is a touch of dark chocolate bitterness, especially in the finish that compliments the coffee and dark roasted malt flavors very well. Aftertaste is bitter and dry.
M: Heavy and smooth mouthfeel from a rich full body and light velvety carbonation. For such a relatively high ABV there is hardly any of alcohol to be found. 
D: One of the fullest, richest, and smoothest stouts I've had the pleasure of sipping. Amazingly rich, roasted, and complex flavors. I'm not a huge coffee fan, but this beer is actually pretty good. 1,063 charactersscottfrie, Aug 16, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5One of the greatest beers Ive ever had. Poured into a nice tulip at Sunset Bar and Grill in Boston. As soon as this jet black, creamy dark violet beer was poured, immediately you smell roasted peaches with undertones of chocolate and coffee....and tastes just the same. This beers carbonation makes sure to coat the pallet with all of its complexity. Coffee, chocolate peach, roasted cherries, malt, hops and a slight taste of alcohol are all preset but its the perfect balance. I absolutely recommend this beer for anyone who loves dark, complex and robust brew.

4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance - Poured into pint glass from 11.5 oz bottle. Pitch black like most imps with a darkish brown thick 2 finger head. Lacing is there like with many fine imperial stouts.
Nose - Coffee, chocolate, and dark malts... in that order, nothing more. Almost perfection.
Taste - Same as the smell. Intense coffee-like qualities, dark roasted chocolate malts. No bitterness, which can be good or bad, but now it is perfect because the balance of the previously mentioned qualities make this one immaculately tasty brew. This is probably the second best tasting imperial stout IMO.
Mouthfeel - Smooth and creamy with a nice balanced carbonation that makes for a near perfect mouthfeel. 
Drinkability - A pretty easy drink for an imperial stout. Knocked one back in about 20 minutes, which means that this is perfectly drinkable without price involved. Now when I pay over $5 for an 11.5 oz bottle of beer, that is not drinkable to me. I'd drink 2 or 3 in a night if I could afford to. Also, love that it had a twist off top. 1,026 charactersBonis, Aug 16, 2010

A-Pours a menacing,opaque,30W black with some reddish,brown and a 1/2 inch,perfectly formed,creamy brown cap of densely packed,tiny bubbles that retreated slowly leaving beautiful,sticky lacing.
S-Dark chocolate ganache,fresh espresso,dark malt
and barely burnt toast.The aroma of this beer was enough to make me a converted stout lover.
T-Unbelievable!Initially,I got dark roasted malt,bittersweet chocolate and burnt marshmallow and then finished with chocolate-covered espresso beans,roasted,bitter almonds and fresh,French press coffee.
M-Full,rich and viscous.Maybe not as thick as I would have liked but this beer still blanketed the tongue nicely.Silky,smooth and well balanced.
D-I am not a stout fanatic but I could drink this ALL night.Absolutely no sign of the 10% ABV.A truly remarkable beer.

4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Looks: thick. Pours from the bottle an unbelievably dark brown. A tiny, tight khaki head recedes quickly to a ring plus film, leaving sticky lattice-like lacing. 
Smells: smoked. I know this was brewed with coffee, but if I didn't, I'd be inclined to call this a rauchbier. Aromas of charcoal, dark chocolate, burnt wood, bacon, sweet cotton candy and bitter espresso are all there, and in that order of descending prominence. 
Tastes: like a chocolate-covered coffee bean. Smoky bacon, sweet cotton candy, earthy hops and dark chocolate all reveal themselves first. Waves of coffee eventually hit at the back of the mouth, but way after the swallow. Once it's there, however, it doesn't leave for quite a while. A nice, enduring aftertaste. As the beer warms, the espresso-like flavors emerge more and more. Fantastic. 
Feels: nicely medium-full bodied, yet still liquid and not too thick. Almost creamy. The carbonation is muted, light, and lovely. 
Drinks: Already a big fan of coffee stouts, my mind was again bent at what this beer did with the caffeinated ingredient. One of the best. 1,094 charactersPhelps, Aug 09, 2010

S: The aroma is of strong roasted coffee, dark malts, some dark chocolate and a faint touch of alcohol.
T: The taste as expected is very malty and full of black coffee along with some creamy chocolate. It's not as intensely sweet as some other big stouts. There's not much of a hops presence but it's really not needed in this type of beer as it retains a good balance without it. The alcohol is very well-disguised. The after-taste is slightly sweet.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium-to-heavy body, medium carbonation, finish is very clean for the style. 689 charactersAnthony1, Aug 09, 2010

From the taste haven't notice much hops in it cause of the coffee bitterness coming through and a nice dark earthy robust flavor is just pounding on my taste buds with a creamy smooth finish.
This Stout is outstanding and wasn't sure about the whole coffee infuse stouts but this is heaven in a bottle. I like beer and I like coffee what a combo. 484 charactersSamuelJackson45, Aug 09, 2010

S: There are aromas of coffee and espresso beans in the nose.
T: Like the smell, flavors of coffee and espresso beans stand out in the taste, which has a slight amount of sweetness and a hint of bitterness. Unlike the bottled version, roasted flavors are not very noticeable.
M: It feels medium-bodied on the palate and incredibly smooth and creamy; the smoothness of the beer on-tap really sets it apart from the bottled version.
D: The beer goes down very smooth and tastes like creamy espresso. I could sip this beer all night long and will definitely try this again if I can find it on-tap because it tastes even better than it does in a bottle. 858 charactersmetter98, Aug 09, 2010

Pours a very dark, viscous, yet not syrupy black color with a great 2 finger tan head that leaves nice lacing. Dark as night. The aroma is great. Has a nice fresh pressed coffee aroma, some dark chocolate notes and even some vanilla hints. really pretty. The taste is very good too. Just a touch on the hot side as i can detect some of the high abv on this one. Otherwise, its got a very rich creaminess to it that really sets the tone of this beer. Also has a nougat like malt profile that keeps it light enough to drink easily. really fluffy body, a touch thinner than i thought. Mouthfeel is great as well. Slightly more carbonated than i would have hoped, but still a great feel on the palate. Light weight which keeps this easy to drink. The slight alcohol burn is all that is keeping me from giving this a near perfect score. needs some time in the bottle. 910 charactersAugustiner719, Aug 05, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours rather viscous... brown when thinned out, nearly black in the glass. Next to no head that's basically completely gone before I even drink it. 
Smells of coffee, a bit of chocolate, and alcohol. A little cherry / raspberry, maybe.
As soon as it went into my mouth, even before I really tasted it, I got the sense of eating espresso beans. That roasted, gritty-without-the-grit, coffee sensation. It's just like sipping a stout-like cold coffee. Just a bit of dark chocolate. Rich flavour without the rich feel.
Pretty friggin' smooth, really! I expected it to be strong, after smelling it. Not as thick as I expected. Nearly flat... not much carbonation, which suits the coffee flavour. A bit of a bitter finish, just like you'd have from an espresso or something. Leaves your throat a little airy. Good job of hiding the 9.5%!
More drinkable than I would have thought on my own... but also a little over-hyped. Still good, though. 940 charactersPEIBeerGuy, Aug 04, 2010

A - India ink black with a creamy 1-finger mocha head. Nice, sticky looking lacing.
S - Big blast of coffee followed with dark roasted malt and bitter dark chocolate.
T - More fine-quality coffee and dark roasted malts. Bitter chocolate, vanilla and the slightest bit of smoke round it out. Tastes decadent, like liquid chocolate-coffee cake.
M - Smooth and creamy with a medium-heavy body and lovely prickly carbonation. Like velvet on the tongue.
D - This certainly lives up to the hype, incredibly dark and smooth, with no hints of the ABV. I will definitely be enjoying more of these in the future! 638 charactersjsanford, Aug 02, 2010

I poured this and got a medium head; tan in color. Lacing is great and head retention is also forever. Body is black.
Nose is burnt, vanilla, charcoal.
Taste is ultra bitter chocolate and smoked or charcoal. Sweet as well. Very, very good taste profile. The finish is really bitter. Probably one of the most bitter I have ever had regardless of beer type. 
Mouth feel is slightly drying, but not a lot.

Had this in a flight. Looked and smelled like your typical russian imperial stout. The usual hints of toffee, cocoa, and mainly coffee in this one. Taste amd drinkability were extremely lacking. Highly over-rated beer in my opinion. Too cloying and sweet with no balance in the coffee/malt/hops. Lack of carbonation doesnt help but not typical of style anyway. Worth tasting but not shelling out $8 for 8 oz or even $7 at a store for a 12 oz. Seek out others if you have a choice. 546 charactersclaspada, Jul 27, 2010

Smell is intense and intoxicating. Coffee is everywhere in this one and drowns out the other smells. Picking up scents of chocolate cake, maybe even caramel and raisins, or it could just be my imagination running wild as this beer smells very inviting.
Taste reveals a short list of strong flavors; mostly aforementioned coffee and chocolate, there are hints of other sugary treats, perhaps black licorice, maple syrup. There is a strong dry bitterness that I couldn't smell and is apparent now: roastiness. It adds another layer to the beer, however I'd very much like to age this beer as perhaps it would mellow out a bit. Personally it's a dry/bit bitter for my tastes. Tastes a bit unbalanced. Overrated?
Mouthfeel isn't bad, a bit bitter. Not too thick or thin; very smooth.
Drinkability is not my favorite category to rate as it is usually irrelevant. However this beer isn't too sweet or syrupy and hides the alcohol very well so I suppose I wouldn't mind another bottle.. 1,165 charactersptykozoon, Jul 27, 2010
4.02/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Tasted from 11.5oz bottle from Lush Roscoe. I have chosen this beer as my 100th rating. The pour is an opaque deep, dark brown with a big, light brown head that slowly recedes, but never fully leaves. The primary smell on the nose is coffee, but underlying are aromas of molasses, super roasty malts, dark chocolate, and caramelized brown sugar. On the front of the palate, this beer is creamy and features the sweeter creme brulee notes. The roasted bitter coffee and chocolate notes begin to come through on the middle of the palate, and the back is dominated by coffee and dark chocolate bitterness. The body is full and creamy with very lively carbonation and a super-long bitter coffee finish. The alcohol is very well integrated, and this beer is extremely drinkable. I am glad that I chose this beer for my 100th rating. It has lived up to the hype of being one of the best beers in the world. 900 characterswedgie9, Jul 27, 2010
4.46/5  rDev +1.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. The beer pours out jet black, literally no light can go through. The head is quite unique, it's a creamy brown/orange/amber color. I expected it to be darker, but I was very intrigued by the slight orange color in it. Has some decent lacing that sticks around until it warms up. The aroma good, but doesn't smell that much like beer, more like a dessert liquor. Mostly coffee and chocolate when its a little colder but as it warms up it tastes like a dessert liquor or some type of "Irish Coffee." Still smells very good though. The taste is very good. For a 9.5 ABV, there isn't much detection in the taste. Here's where you start to realize it's a beer again. The strongest portion is the bittersweet from the coffee and chocolate, but the malts are very noticeable as well. Hops are a little more difficult to detect, but as it warms up they make themselves known. The Mouthfeel is perfect. It's it's smooth yet finishes clean, certainly a full bodied beer. The beer is very drinkable, dangerous for a beer of this alcohol content. 2nd beer I've had from this brewery 2 for 2! 1,123 charactersAndyAvalanche, Jul 24, 2010

Pour is a jet black with a thin layer of brown slightly creamy head. Aroma is coffee, some more coffee, and a bit of dark chocolate malt. Sharp flavors of bittering hops and cocoa / coffee hit my tongue and the lack of carbonation leave them to linger for awhile. The beer seems to be a bit on the acidic side. Body is fairly light and there is little to no stickiness with the beer. 443 charactersneorunner, Jul 22, 2010

Espresso Espresso Espresso, slightly chicory, smokiness, chocolate covered espresso beans, burnt sugar, and smokey malt. I'm not huge on coffee or espresso stouts, but this was pretty good. I liked how there is a distinct difference in flavor from regular coffee stouts and this ESPRESSO stout. It was done well, although splitting a 12oz bottle is all I can do. 371 charactersSilentBob2u2, Jul 21, 2010
4.24/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance:
Great roasted coffee smell with a very faint sweetness...perhaps chocolate. 
Smell:
I love the bourbon and alcohol smell on this. Bits of chocolate, vanilla, and coffee round out a wonderful smell.
Taste:
Tons of roasted coffee like the smell. This tastes much more like espresso than beer. There is a bit of bitterness from the coffee, but the alcohol is really hidden well. 
Mouthfeel:
The beer is very creamy and smooth but not too heavy. The flavors coat my mouth and linger long after I take a taste.
Drinkability:
This was one of the easiest to drink big beers I've had, but the 12 oz bottle was probably just enough for one night. 
The only real knock I have against it is that beer borders on being too 1 dimensional with the coffee. While I preferred the GI BCBCS this is more readily available and a great substitute if I'm looking or a coffee fix. Definitely will seek this one out again. 916 charactersDestral, Jul 21, 2010

Pour is jet black with no light coming through with a 1.5 inch creamy brown head which has now receded to a steady 3/8" head which is seeming to last. Nose from the glass is chocolate, rum, and almost a sweet cream smell. Taste is dark chocolate with a hint of sweetness. Taste sticks with you. I am suprised by the taste not being syrupy as it smelled from the bottle. Alcohol is not as apparent from the taste as it was from the smell. Beer is quite nice and alcohol is well hidden Mouthfeel is not nearly as creamy as I expected from the smell either, but is also pleasant. Only my second venture into the espresso-stout style, but I am well glad I bought this beer. 790 charactersbebbcorp, Jul 20, 2010

It was on the chalkboard but I ordered it and it had kicked. Luckily they had a bottle left! Very excited to try this little treat as I wasn't expecting it at all. 
A - Black, two finger dark brown head, nice lacing. 
S - Espresso, roasted and glorious. Heavy malts. I didn't have to get my nose anywhere near the glass and the smell was invigorating. 
T - A bold coffee taste with a nice bitter backbone. This is what a double coffee stout should taste like. Damn I need to savour this. 
M - Smooth, Creamy, Ballsy. 
D - 9.5 percent doesn't get any easier than this. I had to exert a lot of willpower to make the glass last 20 minutes. My fiance had an amazing desert that made it smell like Fall next to me. I was very tempted to try some however I didn't want to ruin my palate. 
An elite stout would be an understatement. One of the best I've had. 948 charactersDNICE555, Jul 20, 2010

Deep rich smell of ground roasted coffe and milk chocolate. Tastes like a cup of espresso coffee with a lactic feel. As it warms, you get more of the chocolatey and rummy flavors. Well balanced alcohol only a slight warmth in the finale. Not one of those imperial stouts you want to put away but fab to drink fresh. 396 charactersLuk13, Jul 15, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4For a beer named "Mortal Sin" it is an appropriately stygian, somber, raven-black tone that remains morbidly sunless even when held directly up to the sky. Likewise, its head is equally morose; for the most part it's depressed and hard swirling can only invoke it momentarily (the colour that's revealed, moreover, is a rather gloomy, shadowy dark brown). 
I didn't see any coffee beans fall out of the bottle but, from the smell of things, I must have missed them. This thing is an angry, spewing volcano of java and, as much as I appreciate the profusion of flavour and character, I'm left asking 'are you sure there's any beer in this thing?' Notwithstanding, this is one seriously decadent, rich and distinct bouquet. 
For me, as a person who appreciates coffee but dislikes drinking it, a rich, well-crafted Imperial Stout brewed with coffee is a little bit like traveling with a friend you don't particularly care much for - you can still take in all the sights and sounds but, truthfully, you know you could appreciate it all and enjoy yourself more if they weren't there with you...
And, like that travel partner, I find I tire of the coffee sooner or later. As most Imperial Stouts warm they reveal nuances and intricate complexities that you might not have picked up on before. When Péché Mortel warms, it only tastes more and more of coffee (and that oily acidity of the beans becomes much more astringent). If you're one to get jittery from caffeine, expect your heart to start bouncing out of your chest cavity. 
I'd just assume this is well-suited to long-term aging; this bottle, now a year old, doesn't indicate otherwise. With an imbalance of malt to begin with, however, I'd imagine aging will suit coffee-lovers more than those who aren't (then again, I can't really see anyone but coffee-lovers swept away by the thought of stock-piling the stuff anyhow). 
Péché Mortel is about as one-sided as CNN news, but it has a certain indefinable quality that makes it, for my money, one of the most rightly sought after and venerated Imperial Stouts out there. And, despite the overwhelming presence of coffee, it is mystically intricate and notably distinct. The real sin is that these guys can't distribute everywhere! 2,241 charactersbiegaman, Jul 14, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This beer poured an oily black body with a dark tan colored head which was present until the end. The smell was of roasted malts, a really strong smell of alcohol, and a hint of coffee. The taste caught me off guard a little. The first initial taste was bitter, then the alcohol took over, followed lastly by an intense coffee flavor. I must say, after drinking the Mikkeller Breakfast stout, I was expecting the same result, but to my surprise I really enjoyed this stout. This is definitely a sipping beer, but the drinkability for 9.5% was pretty good. All in all, a very tasty beer! 586 charactersKala1073, Jul 14, 2010

A: Pours just about black. Three fingers of mocha head initially. Dwindles to about a finger after a minute. Clingy lace.
S: Rich coffee scent. Sweet milk chocolate that is balanced by bitter coffee. Big roasted malt.
T: Similar to scent. Roasty toasty malt. Very authentic coffee flavor. Baker's chocolate. Some hop bitterness. A very solid dose of bitterness from both the coffee and the malt in the finish. Pleasant aftertaste. As it warms, coffee berries are present in the finish.
M: Soft and creamy. Just enough carbonation. A little more viscosity would make it perfect.
D: Easy to drink. Complex and interesting. I wouldn't really desire another, but that isn't the intention of this beer.

T: Roasted malt and espresso upfront but the caramel comes through rather quickly. The caramel tones in this brew are quite unique. Some dark stewed fruit comes through at the end. Slight RS on the palate.
M: Perfect! Malts are awesome. No bitter coffee flavors, amazing! Nice and thick on the tongue. Lingers on the palate. Fantastic brew!

If you like the combination of heavy roasted malts, dark roasted coffee and semi-sweet chocolate with a bitter finish, then you'll just love the Imperial Stout. The color is very dark, dark brown with very little tan foam and no lace on the side of the glass. Although this stout has 9.5 alc/vol, you can't really tell unless you read the bottle or drink it on an empty stomach. The flavor and bitterness hide the flavor of alcohol. 501 charactersBeerManDan, Jul 12, 2010

Not sure if I can describe the aroma but I'll try. Obviously coffee is up front. Intense espresso. Also get some alcohol in there. Some bitter chocolate as well. Also something else which I struggle to hold onto. Some sort of sweetness over the top of the bitterness. There was some smokiness first up as well.
The smokiness is even stronger on the palate. More sweetness. Amazing length.

A - Good looking stout - appearance reminds me very much of KBS. Dark brown, almost black, with a one finger head that eventually fades to a rim of bubbles on the edge of the glass that stick around for the remainder of the drink. Great, thick, lacing that coats the glass.
S - Fresh coffee, roasts, plums, other dark fruits, and booze. 
T - Sweet coffee up front, warming booze in the middle, followed by a bitter espresso finish. Just outstanding.
M - Perfect. This beer is thick, sticky, and lightly carbonated. Perfect for an imperial stout. Not as thick as motor oil, ala Dark Lord, but not as thin as many impy stouts that have disappointed me.
D - Quite drinkable. The alcohol heat and the bitter espresso finish limit the drinkability, but I could easily drink two of these at least...and then be really hammered if I did. 
This was the second time I've tasted this beer, but the first time that I've been able to give it a fair review. Overall, I am VERY impressed. This one is just outstanding. 1,061 charactersairohead2001, Jul 07, 2010

Smell: Espresso and smokey peat with some dried fruits underneath. Hints of chocolate covered espresso beans (although that chocolate is very faint compared to that big espresso bean).
Taste: Espresso espresso espresso... The dark roasted espresso beans really pop in this brew. The roasted character develops as the brew warms and leaves a nice bitterness on the back end, however that bitterness is more the bitterness you get from black coffee than the bitterness you get from hops.
Mouthfeel: Super viscous and creamy, although leaves the mouth clean and almost a bit sticky.
Drinkability: If you like coffee, especially the dark roasted kind, this is your pride and joy. One might call it a one trick pony as this beer is all coffee, but seeing as how that's the point...it's spectacular. The coffee in this brew tastes fresh and used perfectly...outstanding. 975 charactersBigIrishman, Jul 07, 2010

A - Pours coffee-black, with a tan, two-finger head that recedes quickly to a thick cap. Some sheeting on the glass, but it doesn't stick around very long. 
S - Coffee is upfront, obviously. Strong french roast coffee. Not quite as strong as I expected. Followed up by chocolate, more bitter dark chocolate than sweet, although that characteristic is there as well. A bit of alcohol toward the end. 
T - The bitterness of dark chocolate leads things off, then the coffee kicks in. Definitely a dark roast, it keeps the bitter theme going. There's a hint of alcohol in there, but it's more complimentary than distracting. It works with the bitterness. This is one of my favorite styles, and it's a great example of it. Delicious.
M - Thick and velvety. Carbonation is just right, and it coats the tongue and doesn't fade very quickly. 
D - While this style appeals to me, I can see where the bitter flavors can start to wear over time. Factor in the high-ish abv and I can't see me getting past maybe two of these in a sitting. Although I might try.
O - This is not a good beer, it's a great one. I love coffee stouts, and this one hits all the right notes for me. I just wish I could find it for a cheaper price, I'd drink it for breakfast every morning. 1,291 charactersdjmichaelk, Jul 03, 2010

4.03/5  rDev -8.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3Appearance - 5.0
A firm pour yields 2 to 3 fingers of dense head with the appearance of a light chocolate mousse. Jet black body is impenetrable to light. Head retention and lacing are both spectacular.
Smell - 4.5
Banana fruitiness is evident upon opening, but fades with time. What is left is a powerful aroma dominated by strong black coffee, with back-notes of cocoa, a little smoke and alcohol.
Taste - 4.0
Quite possibly the strongest tasting beer I have ever tried (and this is from someone who has tasted Tactical Nuclear Penguin!). The palate is pounded with flavours of espresso, burnt/roasted malt, cocoa, raw sugar and a little smokiness. Ultimately it is the espresso that wins out - being by far the strongest flavour. Alcohol is warming, but barely perceived in the wealth of flavour. While sweetness is certainly there, the overall impression is of a dry, roasty, espresso-like beer.
Mouthfeel - 4.5
FULL bodied and rather viscous in the mouth. Carbonation is very fine and provides some much needed lightness (let's be honest, there is very little light about this beer!).
Drinkability - 3.0
This is possibly more of a reflection on my preferences than on the quality of the beer - I am not a lover of either stouts or coffee. This is a beer to be sipped over an hour or so.
OVERALL - 4.25
This is one freaking huge beer. As I mentioned before, it is not exactly down my alley, but I honestly could not ask any more of a coffee infused imperial stout. For fans of either strong coffee or stout, this is a beer not to be missed. For me, it's a bit too much coffee and not enough beer. 1,605 charactersLittleCreature, Jun 23, 2010

A-Pours almost black with a one finger mocha colored head that has fair retention and leaves some sticky lacing.
S-Huge espresso with hints of oak and chocolate, maybe a bit of dark fruit and toffee. If you like strong coffee and you like beer, this may be nirvana for your nose.
T-Strong espresso hits immediately, dark roasted malt, a bit smoky, hints of dark fruit and toffee.
M-On the heavy side of medium, not as viscous as other Imperial Stouts, but still good. Perfect carb level-not too much or too little, a bit creamy. Coats the palate well.
D-It is a sipper for sure, but I had no trouble finishing the glass. But the intense espresso taste makes more than one not an option for me.
Overall, an impressive beer. Especially if you like coffee/espresso. 801 charactersLerxst, Jun 23, 2010

Smell is pretty killer and I am not even a coffee drinker. Roasty coffee goodness, hints of booze and even a bit of vanilla. 
Taste is much like the aroma but the coffee is not as forward as I would have assumed. Not as roasted as in the aroma, a bit more smooth and balanced. Once again some booze and vanilla hang out in the finish. A bit bitter in the end.
Good mouthfeel here. Not a ton of carbonation, more creamy. Smooth drinking with a bitter chocolate finish.

Now, what i really like about this is that while there is alot of coffee flavors, they are not overpowering the balance or becoming cloying, which is a problem with quite a few coffee beers ive had before, but that is not the case here and the coffee doesnt run rampant so far to ruin this. there is yet again a milky lactose quality, like a huge coffee milk stout to me. and there is a tiny bit of vanilla poking out, but the roasted bitterness balances it out so evenly.
The mouthfeel here was thinner then expected, and with not alot of carbination. I don't think the light carbination hurt this one at all, but perhaps a bit more thickness would have been cool, i like them pretty viscous.
yea, this is drinkable, very very drinkable for 12oz of beer.
The only thing holding it back from a higher score is i would want a change of pace for bottle two. 1,247 charactersChadQuest, Jun 20, 2010

Pours a motor oil black with a soft head of less than a finger of a creamy mocha colored foam.
Big notes of vanilla, coffee, and oak. No real hop impact as a hot alcohol warmth floods through mouth and chest. 
Delicious as a sipping beer, but some of my tasting compatriots were a bit off put by the intense aromas. Not sure I could handle a full pint of this 9.5% desert-like treat. 463 charactersEastman2009, Jun 19, 2010

Pitch black with a fluffy, long lasting tan head. Exceptional.
The flavour is very big with a rich malt flavour giving way to intense roast and coffee flavour. There is a hit of alcohol at the back too. I feel like the richness of the malt actually detracts just a little from the chocolate and coffee flavours I am looking for.
Big mouthfeel with moderate carbonation helping to cut it just a little bit.
A tasty stout. Maybe this isn't the best bottle but I feel as if the coffee flavour isn't prominent enough. Still quite good. 615 charactersdgilks, Jun 17, 2010

Aroma is malty roasted coffee. Flavor is similar but with MUCH more coffee flavor coming through with some strong bitterness in the finish. Of all the coffee stouts I've had, this ranks very near the top with regard to how strongly the coffee flavor comes through - it really is remarkable.
Nicely carbonated but not overly so, this one is very drinkable. I could see it getting a bit overwhelming after a few though due to the strength of the coffee flavors and the resulting bitterness - it just might be a bit much for some people. For me though - i LOVE it. Would drink this any chance I get.
EXCELLENT. 747 charactersthetomG, Jun 17, 2010

A: poured black as night with a half finger of head that left good sticky lacing on the glass.
S: big coffee booze and bourbon aromas with roasted malts chocolate accents with hints of vanilla and slight creamy milk notes.
T: nice coffee punch strikes bold on the palate with nice vanilla from the barrel I'm guessing and great roastiness from the malts. The beer also has chocolate and sweet creamy notes with a mild nop bite.
M: medium creamy body with a low amount of carbonation and a sweet mild bitter finish.
D: very good and intresting beer that was big on the coffee but had lots of other ingredients to accent the overall flavor. Drank well all the way thru and wasn't too sweet. I'm glad I had the chance to try it. 777 charactersGobzilla, Jun 16, 2010

S: Holy coffee, along with sweet, sweet dark chocolate and roasted malts. Smells like an espresso, seems promising.
T: Where to begin? How about with a lot of coffee, but also a decent amount of chocolate to make a mocha flavor that is simply great. I even get a tiny bit of hop bitterness at the end, though faint. This is a complete winner.
M: Like silk, perfect carbonation, pretty low, but so incredibly creamy. Faint boozy feeling, but in a good way.

Smack of dark roasted expresso aroma right away.
Dark chocolate somewhat masks the coffee flavor at first, although it becomes very present on the back end. Candied fruit, and slight bitterness blended nicely throughout. 
Creamy and viscous, this coats your tongue and goes down smoothe as can be, with only a little sharpness at the back. 
Arguably the most drinkable Imperial Stout I have ever had. Was gone before I knew it. Alchohol is very well masked. Pissed I only bought one. Simply amazing. 571 charactersJToad, Jun 08, 2010

4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5As dark as can be. Poured really slowly into the glass. Thick, smooth, viscous, heavy. Thick tanned head, good lacing. Setles but a nice thin head remains. Impressive for this much abv. 
Heavy ground coffee bean aroma. Mixes nicely with the 'standard' roasty, dark chocolate, cigarette ash. No hops here at all and no alcohol surprisingly. The boldness of the arom. Does hint at it's strength. 
The flavor lingers. Drying roastiness, along with the ash and coffee make this a two faced beer. It contrasts so much with the heavy mouthfeel with all the residual sugars, though it does not come across all that sweet. Slight warming in the finish makes this a fantastic winter brew. 
That about sums it up. Easily drinkable too. Half the bottle has gone without any trouble, yet it's easy to sip slowly and consider all it's atributes. Very nice. 846 charactersjoecast, Jun 04, 2010
3.83/5  rDev -13%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This was poured into an oversized snifter.
This is dark. A solid wall of darkness. Some shimmering glimpse of light shows itself in the head-- which is about 1 finger of creamy beige bubbles. Looks fluffy and thick-- like the foam on a cappuccino. There are visible rings of lace left behind that help add to the overall aesthetic. 
The smell reminds me of chocolate covered bananas and strong bitter coffee. There is a deep roastiness in this beer that doesn't present with dryness nor sweetness... but it lingers in the realm of the bitter cocoa and coffee beans. This beer tastes of huuuuge coffee notes. Even the mouthfeel reminds me of coffee, only thicker. The carbonation level is good-- nice and creamy feel with a smoothness that is unmatched by any other coffee stout I've had. I actually think this one would be amazing if they gave it just a hint of vanilla to accent everything. But there is a slight hint of herbal banana that keep popping up-- I wonder if it is something from the coffee beans that I can't put my finger on.
As far as it goes, if you love coffee and you love stouts, then you'll love this beer. I personally haven't been a coffee drinker in a few years, and even when I was, it wasn't gourmet coffee. It was late night Denny's coffee. This has a roasty fragrant spiciness that I can only attribute to the coffee used. This is certainly interesting and worth a shot, and when graded vs. other coffee stouts, this manages to score pretty well. In my personal experience, however, there are more than a few other stouts I would take over this one. 1,579 charactersAleWatcher, Jun 03, 2010

Appearance: Pours a smooth, jet black featuring a slight khaki, uneven head.
Smell: Very malty and great, bitter roasted coffee aroma
Taste: tastes of ice coffee the colder it is, as it warms to room temp it features some smokiness, indicative of a well roasted coffee bean, ever so slight hoppiness, doesn't taste overly alcoholic
Mouthfeel: very smooth and full bodied, very slight carbonation, very pleasant
Drinkability: very drinkable and different than most imperial stouts, focused more on coffee flavor more than chocolately undertones which was appreciated, delicious and smooth beer
I'd recommend picking up a bottle or two of the Peche Mortel. Everywhere I've seen it it's been priced at 5.99 per bottle. 775 charactersaasher, May 31, 2010

The smell is of strong coffee with hops lingering in the background and a bit of alcohol somewhere in the mix
Strong coffee is the first thing that hits the taste buds, a bitterness is perceived throughout. A second taste brings a bitter malty note and of course the strong coffee. I wonder how much coffee was infused into the brewing process. The alcohol is very much there and warms all the way to the stomach. 
Mouth feel is pretty much perfect for stout such as this, medium to heavy with a very slight carbonation.
This is not a beer I could drink all the time. I will put a few of these away and see how they mature over time. 710 charactersalpineclimber, May 30, 2010

A- Pours a black, opaque, color with a 1 to 2 finger head. The head is uneven, and a tan/khaki color. Little to no Lacing.
S- Malty/coffee tones in the nose. 
T- Dark Chocolate and Coffee come through in the taste, and there is a good bit of bitter taste in the end. The aftertaste is warming due to the high ABV, but not off-putting. As the beer warms more sweetness becomes evident. 
M- Very smooth beer. 
D- Deceptive amount of Alcohol in it, felt like I could drink more, but this is probably one that is better left for a night in rather than a night out. 610 charactersscarfield, May 28, 2010

Alcohol peaks through on the finish, but I like the zap with the bitter carbonation. 397 charactersGolden, May 27, 2010

Mild gelatinous wobble to it just from the thickness, but yeah mild, it's fluid of course. Looks like a good imp. stout.
Smell is strong, first of all. A lot of sweetness to it. Hints of bubblegum of all things on there with some fruity hints of currant and apple. Slight roasty note at the back with a tinge of espresso. Overall a bit too sweet for my liking but interesting. Unique, to say the least.
Taste is roasty with a nice smooth mouthfeel, lots of cocoa flavour on the early mid descends into a noticeable coffee character, lots of espresso bitterness with a slight mocha tinge and a lingering roastiness. Leaves with a really nice, pleasantly bitter toasty note. Has lots of spice overtones as well, clovey and peppery particularly on the back where the alcohol kicks in, nice and toasty warm with a slight scorch of booze that just stumbles its way down the throat. Not quite as mind-blowing on the flavour as I'd hoped, but very pleasant nonetheless.
As mentioned before, smooth mouthfeel. Gorgeous and silky. Noticeable body and strength but it just slips through the mouth, absolutely perfect.
A pleasant winter warmer, roasty and nicely bitter. 1,268 characterslaituegonflable, May 25, 2010

A: Jet black with about a finger of fluffy brown foam. Foam settles quickly into a solid ring around the glass with a decent amount of lacing. The lacing becomes more and more abundant as it warms.
S: Fresh roasted coffee. Period. I'm really not getting much else. Perhaps a bit of that smoke / tobacco flavor, but I only notice the aroma after having detected the flavor.
T: when still near fridge temps this brew tastes like an iced coffee with a half shot of alcohol- just enough to notice but not so much to make you cringe. As it warms I am getting hints of smoke and tobacco, akin to the taste of the wrapper on a fine cigar just before you light it.
M: thick, creamy and smooth- definitely a full-bodied brew. When still near fridge temps a pleasant prickle of carbonation helps to balance out the viscosity of the beer. The finish is long and dry with a satisfying bitterness that lingers throughout the entire glass.
D: Coffee stouts, for me, represent yet another example of a strange dichotomy I've noticed in my taste for certain foods and beverages- I hate olives, yet I love olive oil; I enjoy tomatoes and but I can stand tomato juice. I'm a big fan of a well-crafted coffee stout but black coffee is not my thing. I'm not sure why that is, but I'm not going to think much about that now- I'm too busy enjoying the heck out of this Peche Mortel. I'm not familiar with this brewery at all, but if Peche Mortel is any indication of their brewing prowess, I'll be on the lookout for more examples of their work. 1,644 charactersjhoban19, May 25, 2010

It appears a very dark brown color with some lighter brown and redish hues around the edges. The head appears more than 2 fingers strong with a foam of brown creaminess that retains well and laces in patches all about the glassware. The aroma of this beer is a very rich sweet chocolate mingled with coffee at first. Than the dark grains and a slight touch of mineral character that is intertwined with the hops and this beer almost starts to presents itself a bit musty. Taste is roasty grain bitterness mixed with black coffee and a nice alcohol presence that warms the mouth and can be felt going all the way down when swallowed. Little bit of hops are evident in the finish that is a bitterness entensified by the roasted malt character. Lingering flavors of the dark malt are left in the mouth coupled with the alcohol which leaves tastes of chocolate and coffee lingering long after each sip. There is a medium feel with this beer and a modest amount of carbonation. Very good double stout, just the right amount of coffee that doesnt completely overtake the beer and the ever present alcohol feel plays well with the other flavors. 1,177 charactersstakem, May 23, 2010

Appearance -- Pours a - brace yourself - jet black, with ample dark khaki head that, surprisingly, didn't completely evaporate into nothingness. Nice.
Smell -- Coffee dominates, with some malt sweetness and char.
Taste -- Coffee, dark chocolate, and sweet caramelized maltiness up front, followed up by charred wood and some acridity. In the finish you taste a lot of coffee, dark chocolate, and some cherry.
Mouthfeel -- Oily, viscous, with light amount of prickly carbonation. 
Drinkability -- This was immensely satisfying; I can only imagine how exceptional the barrel-aged version would be. Great coffee flavor way out front, smooth, great balance of chocolate-like sweetness and burnt bitterness, abv well hidden. Definitely a treat. 814 charactersyeahnatenelson, May 23, 2010

Nose shows intense dark chocolate and roasted barley, with roasted coffee showing up a few seconds later. Very complex roasted character, unlike some more mundane stouts that just slap you in the face with 1-dimensional burnt notes. Quite a lot of sweet caramel in the background, along with hints of sultanas.
Flavours are similarly rich and very sweet. Loads more chocolate and coffee quite prominent amongst the roasted barley. Alcohol is definitely noticeable and just shy of being solvent-like.
Very rich body and suitably low carbonation. 591 charactersCrazyDavros, May 20, 2010

Poured into a NB tulip glass. I guess around 50 degrees F or so. 
A: Opaque, jet black, but a clean dark color. Mocha chino head with good lacing. Looks like a great espresso shot. Nice head that sticks around to the bitter, pun, end.
S: Upfront with bold roasty coffee notes. Followed by a sweet molasses and dark chocolate aroma. Faint hint of hops for a nice floral bouquet. 
T: Crisp roasty coffee flavor with a sweet dark chocolate finish. Slight bitter finish from coffee and hops that compliment one another. 
M: Medium to full body. Chewy, dense, supple on the tounge. Nice dry finish. Just like a good cup of joe, but so much better.
D: If it weren't for the alcohol, that you can't taste, this would be a great beer for breakfast or lunch, or supper, or mid-night drink. I could drink this all day as long as I took my time.
All and all this is a great coffee beer. But I haven't had a coffee beer that I didn't like. Not my favorite of the style but deserving of it's place. I can't wait to age my other bottles and see how they taste in a few months. 1,101 charactersrwf08, May 20, 2010

Appearance - Dark brown/black with a cinnamon head that follows the beer all the way down to the bottom of the glass
Aroma - Smells heavily of roasted coffee and molasses with a subtle hint of hops
Taste - Tastes strongly of coffee with undernotes of chocalate malt which gives it some sweetness to contrast the slightly bitter taste from the hops. A very complex and amazing taste
Texture - Moderately thick and lightly carbonated, stays true to the imperial stout genre
Drinkability - an amazing beer, definitely one of my all time favorites. Meant to be sipped slowly and savored like Scotch. Can stand alone without a food complement 739 charactersCraigMac, May 20, 2010

smell is coffee, milk chocolate, some hops and a little fruit. 
taste is absolutely amazing; following the nose with roasted, coffee and chocolate malts. has a nice sweetness to it without being cloying. a pleasing, slightly puckery hop bitterness and a long, bittersweet finish make this very well balanced. alcohol content is extremely well hidden.
full bodied but incredibly smooth and creamy.

A-- Poured jet black with a very dark brown head, faded into film very quickly. Head retention is ok when swirling the glass. Does leave marks of the rotation of the swirl in the head. Beer has legs like wine does on high ABV %.
S-- Big rich coffee, dark chocolate and heavy roasted malts. Very warming aroma and great smell.
T-- Big, thick, and rich. Bitter coffee, thick and rich chocolate. Immediate warming feeling. Very good!
M-- Great mouthfeel. Get the bitterness from the coffee, followed by the sweetness and bitterness of the chocolate. Very well balanced. Coffee flavor just lasts and lasts. Right amount of chocolate sweetness. Big and bold feel. NICE!
D-- Well hidden ABV%, though a lot of warming sensations very quickly and very smooth for being very bitter in some ways. Goes back to being very well balanced and the right touches of chocolate. A coffee bomb. Impressive to say the least. Very good to see this brewery replace the no longer distributed Unibroue in Australia. A must seek out beer. 1,087 charactersmulder1010, May 19, 2010

T - Powerful and up-front with the coffee followed by a pleasing alcohol warmth with an almost smoky chocolate aftertaste.
M - delicious and rich. Very pleasing aftertaste that lingers and lingers. 
D - seductively dangerous. The subtlety of the alcohol is hidden by an amazingly powerful balance. Goes down much too easy.

Wow. Holy crap, that is a big impressive coffee-bomb on the nose. Huge notes of high-roast espresso bean, ultra-high cocoa chocolate and smoldering charcoal. That is insane - so much dark deliciousness roiling about. It's so dark, but veers almost towards smokiness in one direction and comforting sweetness in the other. Big, big aromas - and the coffee notes are just what is promised and expected. Wonderful.
Lovely on the palate too, although the intensity here becomes a little confronting. Smooth entry, with some subtle dark characters like well-browned toast. Everything hits on the aftertaste. Big rich and roasted characters of rough dark cocoa, carbonised coffee bean with a smooth lightly boozy note to wash it down. Feel could be slicker, but that's picking at what is an otherwise exemplary beer.
I just said it: an exemplary beer. The booze is very well hidden, or is used to great effect where present, leaving it a very drinkable beer given its intensity and alcohol content. An absolutely wonderful stout, superbly well done. 1,236 characterslacqueredmouse, May 16, 2010

A- Pours extremely black in color. No light shines through this bad boy. The dark tan head was two fingers worth. The retention was modest. Not much lacing left. Plenty of bubbles rising to the top.
S- Really nice. It's like scrolling up to Starbucks nice. The coffee aroma really jumps out at me. There are hints of dark chocolate and roasted malts up in the mix, but the winner here is the coffee.
T- Follows the nose. Big dominating coffee right out the gate. There is also dark, bittersweet, chocolate that plays a big role. As the brew warms a little vanilla comes out to play, as well as some of the alcohol that has been completely nowhere to be found until now. I'm actually really enjoying this a lot more as it warms closer to room temperature. 
M- My only knock on this brew...it's a little overcarbonated IMO. The body is medium at best and I would prefer it to be a little more creamy. It has a slick oily feel to it. The finish is bitter, a good thing here. The coffee really lingers for a while. 
D- A perfect 5....nuff said.

I am in love with this smell. An abundance of roasted malt and fresh brewed coffee. Vanilla bean, creme brulee(burnt sugah) caramel creme candy, melted milk chocolate, toffee, slight dark fruit (to a lesser) raisin? fig??
Taste is quite bitter, like a fine cup of freshly brewed black esspresso, with loads of lingering roasted malt. Some burnt sugar and dark chocolate, very little sweetness, slight heat but alcohol for the most part isn't all that noticable.
Moderate levels of carbonation and a very creamy nearly chewey texture on this medium to full bodied sipper.
THis is one of the premier big coffee stouts on the market. Dangerously quaffable @ nearly 10 percent! A helluva brew for coffee fans. 785 charactersbonsreeb85, May 15, 2010

4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Hype is a dangerous thing. I have to admit I was expecting to absolutely blown away by this beer. I was very impressed. Not the messiah of beers but very good. Nose is quite potent, could smell it well before I got it into the glass. However it's a fairly stock-standard Imperial stout nose. Heavy on the coffee and roastiness, bit of vanilla. Very nice but perhaps lacking any individual charcter. Silky smooth, it just slides down with an extremely long and satisfying finish. Some tasty chocolatey sweetness stands out. A mighty tasty brew indeed but a touch too much espresso for me. 587 charactersjuju7, May 11, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from bottle into pint glass.
Appearance-Pours a dark slick near-black brown with a coffee-tan colored head, thick chunks of lace are left along the sides as the head recedes.
Smell-Freshly ground coffee beans, this beer smells like coffee plain and simple mingling with some chocolate almost like an alcoholic mocha latte, me likey.
Taste-HOLY....wow, just, just wow. Darkly roasted coffee of an espresso-like intensity followed by rich bittersweet chocolate; it's just like the nose only MORE. It's delectable.
Mouthfeel-It's definitely not the fullest imperial stout I've had in terms of mouthfeel but that raw, acidic-coffee palette-cleaning quality really gives a nice crispness to the tongue while you drink.
Drinkability-Extremely drinkable, I wish I had another bottle on hand; next time I get it I'll be sure to grab two.
Notes-I am both a coffee lover and a chocolate lover, I'm one of those people who wakes up every morning looking forward to that mocha latte to give me that cocoa and coffee fix. This beer is basically that in alcohol form and crafted brilliantly, if you're at all like me in your love for things chocolaty and coffee-like you should definitely pick this one up. 1,205 charactersManoftyr, May 09, 2010
3.79/5  rDev -13.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4From 11.5 oz bottle to pint glass. There are (2) sets of numbers 0 through 9 for notching on the label, but someone must have called in sick on label notching day.
A: Pours with a huge 3 1/2 finger head. Frothy, creamy, fluffy, and chunky. Beautiful. Medium dark brown head and very long lasting. The body is pitch black and completely opaque.
S: Malts are heavy and roasted with ENORMOUS fresh ground coffee aromas. Resiny hops and a yeastiness that reminded me of rain soaked leather. There is also a weird, uncomfortable and slightly off-putting meatiness to this brew. (Honestly, venison came to mind and I'm not sure that's a good thing when discussing beer.)
T: Luckily the taste is an improvement from the smell. Semi sweet on the nose and palate, particularly the mid-palate. Rich, robust, coffee, bitter baking cocoa mixed with Hershey's syrup and charred wood. The chocolate is EASILY dominated by the intense coffee flavor and aroma.
M: The body is medium at best and slightly disappointing. Much thinner than expected. Although this brew is creamy and sticky, it is no where near sharing the mouthfeel qualities of the best Imperial Stouts. The carbonation is soft but the silver lining is that the softness allows the lactose quality of this brew to come through. Finishes bitter with an acridness that I did not find very pleasant.
D: I'm not really sure what the hype is here. Good but not great, at least to me. I'll have to try another down the road. At the time of this review, and much to my surprise, Péché Mortel is in BA's Top 100 and I'm not exactly on board the hype train. 1,604 charactersFeDUBBELFIST, May 07, 2010

"Black as midnight on a moonless night" - Agent Dale Cooper. Twin Peaks. 
Pretty much sums up the appearance and taste of this beer. 
1/2 inch head, nice lacing. Obvious aroma of coffee. Burnt coffee grounds, coffee with the added bonus of booze.
Nowhere near as smooth as KBS, nor as tasty. I want a velvety texture, and this beer isn't cutting it. Nowhere near as complex, I'm not sure why people insist on comparing the two, other than the shared coffee taste. 
However, looking forward to possibly finding this on tap when I head to Montreal. I'm thinking the bottle I found here in Grand Rapids is pretty old and dusty. I think I need to taste this from the source, and then re-review. 734 characterssullenbee, May 06, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours very dark brown, almost black with a mild tan head that leaves very little lacing.
Aroma is smokey dark grain, coffee, chocolate and anise. 
Taste is very rich and full. Intense smoke and charred grain is softened by smooth chocolate, molasses and dark fruit sweetness. Finishes with leafy tobacco and espresso coffee bitterness.
Mouthfeel is medium-full. Smooth and soft.
A rich and flavorful stout. Flavor is big and bold, but restrained. 450 charactersBlakaeris, May 04, 2010
4.84/5  rDev +10%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured a deep dark black with no light poking through, almost no head to speak of, just a soap ring of dark brown bubbles.
The nose is huge, big roasted malts, dark coffee, bitter chocolate and a touch of anise.
The flavor doesn't let up after the aroma onslaught. Big and complex with dark sweet fruits, coffee, chocolate, a light smoke and a big black burnt bitterness to even out the sweetness of the alcohol and fruit. Very complex as it warms I get some maple and oak as well and the smokey bitterness seems to build the more I drink, buy the end its almost a bit on the bitter side.
The mouthfeel is thick and creamy and very oily leaving a long lasting bitter tongue coating, feels like it will linger on for days.
This is truly excellent, does a great job living up the hype that has been established for it. Looking forward to more of these in the future. 868 charactersbashiba, May 04, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 11.5oz bottle into a snifter glass.
Appearance is dark brown as it pours then black once its all in the glass with a one finger light mocha head that dissipates within a few minutes into a small cap.
Smell certainly has the aroma of coffee, sweet and bitter at the same time. It contains roasted malts and a mild chocolate hint in there as well.
Taste is similar to the smell in that is has a very nice flavor of sweet and roasted coffee. Its pretty tasty and complex with roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate and a nice bitterness in the finish.
Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation that leaves a nice little bite on the tongue. As it warms it becomes much smoother. 
Drinkability is great. Its a nice flavorful coffee stout and goes down pretty easy for me. The alcohol was only barely noticeable after if warm up for a while. I would still say its a once a time brew for me, based on price but certainly worth a try. 974 charactersMrStark, May 03, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This is my final brew from this brewery so hopefully ive saved the best til last,it pours a jet black oil hue that lets no light in whatsoever with average carbonation that leaves a one finger mocha laced head and a rim of clingy lacing,the smell from this brew is a mix of boozy alcohol,dark coffee,blackcurrants and dark plums,it has an above average mouthfeel which is a cross between thick and medium which is rather easy to down and makes drinking more than one of these tempting even though the ABV is recognisable it is somewhat hidden to give the appearance that this is less than its 9.5%ABV and exudes tastes of dark expresso,plums,blackcurrants,mocha and really rich dark chocolate,overall this is a really decent brew that id rate probably second best of the six offerings i have had from this brewery and would drink again. 836 charactersADZA, May 02, 2010
4.46/5  rDev +1.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap @ the Winking Lizard. Beer #43 on my beer tour. They got one keg at the Fairlawn location, so I finished my housework and decided to make the 35 minute drive down I-271 to I-77 and visit the city I used to work in back in the day. I had 2 pours, about 10-12 oz each in an open mouth tulip style stemmed glass. I was so thrilled to get the chance to have this beer on tap - I've had bottles before but always questioned their freshness. As this was the only keg the distributor got, I felt lucky to try this great beer fresh and from a premium draft establishment.
Came a bit too cold, but I palmed the tulip until it got in the 45 degree range. This beer looked like a magazine cover. Absolutely perfect - tan creamy head is one finger but sticks around, topping the black body. Opaque and impenetrable to any light. A legendary looking stout.
Smell is great, nice roasted malt meshes perfectly with the coffee. Touches of chocolate and black strap molasses. Not terribly expressive coffee component like some American coffee beers - this meshes well. Lactose sugar is present in the nose as well. A nice coffee and cream thing going on, could be a bit more expressive though IMO.
Taste is just short of perfection. Huge roasted malt presence. Coffee, chocolate, molasses. Touch of sweet cream then a bitter end that doesn't seem hops driven, more like coffee bitterness. Very flavorful and deep and complex. Really a great tasting coffee beer, I would kill to try the bourbon version side by side with a KBS because I think the taste here gives FBS a run for it's money. Touch of alcohol noticeable as it warms, but nothing distracting.
Mouthfeel was such a delight - starts off light and I thought it would be watery, but there's a huge viscous layer underneath that gives a milkshakey consistency. Carb is light w/o being too light. I loved the mouth on this beer!!
Drinkability was wonderful, on an imperial curve as this is a 9.5% and means business. But I had two pours because one just wasn't enough. Loved this beer, worth a trip to have on tap. Thanks to the Lizard for bringing in this lovely treat! 2,121 charactersjampics2, May 01, 2010

A- Black, nice thick and black with a beige head that does not last too long. Nice lacing left behind.
S- Sweet coffee, dark chocolate, alcohol.
T- Bitter coffee, char, dark roast malt, bitter coffee. I'm also picking up the faintest chocolate and dark fruit.
M- a bit thin for the amount of coffee and bitterness. Could be sweeter and thicker, possibly less carbonation.
D- not one of my faves by any means, nothing horrible at that. I can finish the bottle no prob, but I don't think I'll drink the second- rather save that one for a later date. 580 charactersyouradhere, Apr 30, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Reviewed from my notes. My pour was from a vintage 2009 keg. The beer is black with a tan foam head. It is thin in the center, but thick and clinging to the sides at its edge. There is a healthy amount of clinging and rising carbonation. They are working their way through the foam, causing a few bubbles to appear on top. It has a bitter, roasted dark chocolate aroma. It smells a lot like fresh coffee beans. The flavor has tons of coffee bitterness throughout. There is some sweet malt flavor in the back that provides a great base. I don't have much else to say about the flavor, other than the simplicity of my review doesn't do the taste justice. This is a medium bodied stout. It leaves a good coat behind that is sticky but not overly sweet. In fact, it's mostly bitter. I find it to be a pretty drinkable coffee stout. I'm not a coffee drinker, and though the coffee flavor is strong, it isn't too bad. This beer is recommended. 937 charactersToasterChef, Apr 29, 2010

T - Very strong coffee flavor, roasted malts, and then the lovely smack in the mouth of Alcohol.

A - very dark with a tall tight tan head.
S - chocolate, roasted malts. Nice and complex, but a bitter level as well.
T - smoky chocolate coffee. Mild alcohol after taste.
M - solid coating. Tingling on the front of the tongue. Mild alcohol tingle on the back of the throat.

Appearance - Dark with a brown head that quickly dissipates to a collar
Taste - First impression is all coffee and bitter notes. Maybe a touch of alcohol too. All I'm getting is burnt coffee and bitter with hints of alcohol. Got a little better over time but still searching for something positive but that's not the way beer tasting should be. This beer smooths out with time and warming into flavors of coffee and roasted malts but still a lot of bitter.
Notes - Really a twist off cap? 551 charactersjwhawkins81, Apr 25, 2010

4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4This is one of the thickest, densest blacks I've ever seen. A brown head sits on this one at a couple fingers, bringing the obvious comparisons to a latte or cappuccino. It's extremely dense and thick, retains exceptionally well, and leaves thick rings of lacing behind.
The aroma is a rich, robust medley of roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, and dark coffee. It's very nicely rounded with earthy notes and just the slight sweetness to balance out the bitterness. This one is fresh-roasted, just-bagged exceptional beans, not Folgers.
A big, malty espresso comes through first, bitter but not burnt or acidic, giving way to the taste of an extremely high cacao (85%+) dark chocolate, roasted barley and coffee never fading, then finishing with a sort of creamy notes and lingering sharp/sweet notes. The alcohol peeks through now and again, especially on a sip, but is otherwise well masked.
The body is everything I could have hoped for; rich, robust, incredibly creamy, smooth, and full-bodied with just enough carbonation to perfectly round it out.
Well, this one's definitely a sipper; exceptionally big and very heady with a high ABV. Obviously it's delicious. While I'd love as many as I could put down, there are only so many one could drink at a time. 1,263 charactersBrenden, Apr 23, 2010

Dark as sin with an amazing tan head with better retention than the historical wrongs some Qubecers cling to. Ditto on the lacing.
This might be on beer where the aroma worsens, albeit very slightly, as the beer warms. Very nice expresso aroma complete with that slight almond touch.
Ditto on the taste. Expresso, touch of black forest cake, and a hint of smoke. Booze from the 9% ABV doesn't make itself known untill the finish...and the it's TOO LATE...
Full bodied and very, very smooth mouthfeel.
very, very worthy of any beer freak's time. 671 charactersShadman, Apr 22, 2010
4.88/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've had this on tap at the brewpub before, and that's made me pretty damn biased against the bottled version (especially at the several State Line Liquors tastings during which I've been served this beer... turning my nose up thinking about the offering I had on tap). But I'm breaking my self-imposed rule of only reviewing beers if I'm on my final bottle of a (bomber/4pk/6pk/case) and reviewing this with 4 bottles left in my wonderful boxed 6 pack purchased my my even more wonderful girlfriend during her trip to Montreal.
A: Aside from the head being a surprisingly lighter brown (like Ovaltine with too much milk) than expected, this is exactly the beer one would expect. Served in my nonagonal pint glass, it looks juuust right. The high alcohol content leaves a tiny bit of just-hanging-on lacing on the top of the glass.
S: The reason I've given this category a lower score than the others is because, like a few high-alcohol beers I've had, there isn't as much of a robust smell left as one would desire. I had a bottle of Founders' Breakfast Stout before this and was blown away by being able to smell it so strongly as I poured it (on a counter littered with the remnants of a tomato and basil salad, no less) and this beer is lacking in that department. Of course, I'll be posting a separate review next time I have it on tap, as that's a whole different story. Either way, gorgeous notes of coffee, chocolate, and lactose are picked up on the nose.
T: Worth every accent aigu that's been expended to name this amazing beer. Tastes of bittersweet dark chocolate, followed by the taste of a creamy... well, I must refer to my girlfriend's moniker to describe a chocolate flavored iced coffee: "mocha drink." The fact that one can find this enchanting flavor in a beer that is almost as boozy as red wine is quite the achievement. I drank this out of the refrigerator, which means it's likely in the 40 degrees Fahrenheit range. I know that's too cold for a lot of Imperial Stout drinkers, but it's right on the money for this particular beer: it shows its alcohol content more than the average below 10% brew. I tend to chalk that up to the beer tasting so damn fresh, and I can only imagine what changes it goes through when it's been aged in a cellar (perhaps I'll let you know about that when I own more property than a 2nd floor apartment).
M: Creamy. Maybe I'm biased, as during the day I drink my coffee black - but this is something I would welcome for breakfast every morning if I were confident in my ability to hold a valid driver's license. It's delightfully smooth and creamy, and the coffee flavor is merely a small part of what makes it so special. One would swear that whole milk is involved to give it such a heavy, creamy mouthfeel - but that's just the wizardry of Dieu du Ciel at work.
D: I'm the kind of guy who'd order a chocolate milkshake at one end of the boardwalk... and end up craving another for my walk back. So for me, the drinkability warrants a perfect score.
I know this is $5+ per bottle in the United States. I know. It's $20 or less for a six pack in Quebec, so if you get a chance to visit, buy a lot of it. But for now, reconsider the $8+ bomber of stout you're going to buy from some American microbrewery and buy a 12 oz. bottle of this instead. You'll be oh so glad you did - and you'll be inadvertently helping out the Montreal tourism industry - as a trip to Vices et Versa and the Dieu du Ciel brewpub will be in order ASAP. 3,488 charactersmfunk9786, Apr 22, 2010

A: Jet black when it is being poured, it has a nice deep brown head, which slowly fades.
S: Smells of rich coffee.
T: You get a nice roasted dark coffee upfront, with a mild/moderate chocolate afterwards. When it settles for a minute, all of the flavors really get kicked up a notch. The finish turns slightly bitter chocolate and coffee.
M/D: The lingering taste of this beer goes on for quite some time. Very thick mouthfeel, the drinkability is the same as a starbucks coffee. It is really good while you drink it, but as for a repeat, you dont need another one for a couple of days. I enjoy this beer, and I have to say, I like it better then beer geek brunch. Both are great though. 788 characterskylehayworth, Apr 19, 2010

Intense espresso/coffee bean aromas on this one, along with some roasted malt and a bit of hop. On the palate, I again get a huge hit of coffee, balanced nicely by roasted malt, dark chocolate and alcohol. I had heard nothing but raves about this beer, so I was a bit let down. Still, it was pretty solid. 380 charactersemmasdad, Apr 19, 2010

I'm a West Coast IPA fan (see Central City's Red Racer), but this brew also makes me proud of what Canada is now achieving for beer quality. Finally in Montreal and had a glass at the Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel.
There are many expert reviews of this wonderful beer and there is not much more to say.. I saw its biggest strength as mouthfeel. I'm often disappointed with stouts or variations that feel watery. This was perfect. What an amazing balance between the coffee taste and bitterness. It gives IPA fans like me a bitterness fix but with rich cofffee instead of fruity flavours on the front end. 683 characters604growler, Apr 17, 2010

A - Pours a very dark dark oily brown very close to pitch black. There is a very thin dark tan head that is about .25 inches. 
S - First off a very strong but at the same time smooth roasted coffee aroma. Very delicious. Then there is some nice sweet chocolate accompanied by some mild vanilla spice. Very well a balanced aroma. 
T - Absolutely delicious. Smooth and creamy chocolate flavor comes up front quick but is quickly overwhelmed by a great roasted coffee flavor. There is nice chocolate sweetness and bitterness as well as that nice coffee acidity at the end. Some mild bitterness is perceived at the end but the roasted aftertaste is more prevalent.

Coffee and caramel on nose - like a coffee soda. Rich roasty aroma. A little wet earth character - good terrior - smells of freshly brewed coffee.
Roasted coffee with a caramel and milk chocolate essence. Earthy and bitter finish. Very strong brew. There's a black pepper kick to this beer as well. This is a full-bodied beer. The alcohol does come through on the palate.
This is a mouth-coating brew! 51.99 second finsh! What a knock-out of a beer!

S: Nice rich smell with lots of coffee. Some light dark chocolate notes as well. As it warms, picks up some bitter notes as well, possibly from the coffee.
T: Really rich, deep flavors dominated by dark chocolate and roasted coffee. Intense. Some sweetness, but not overly so. Super long finish that reminds me of chewing on a chocolate covered espresso bean. A little heat towards the end, but not enough to detract from the nice bitter finish.
M: Thick mouthfeel, but not too oily. MOderate to high carbonation for the style.

Pours very dark brown, borderline black. A thin one finger of thick tan head forms and dissipates fairly quickly leaving a bit of haze throughout the drink...
Aroma is strongly one-sided at first...dark roasted coffee...somewhat smokey with a bit of dark bitter chocolate, roasty, malty and a bit of sweetness emerges as it warms...
Tastes just like it smells, dark roasted, borderline burnt cold coffee at first, bitter and roasty. A bit of complexity shows up through the hops, slightly piny and a tiny bit of citric bitterness...
Mouthfeel is slightly less thick than expected but still quite coating and chewy. Full bodied, decent carbonation and a tiny bit of heat from the alcohol...
This was my second time trying this beer, first in the bottle and then here, on tap...liked it a lot more the second time as I was able to detect more complexity than just overall one-sided coffee at first... 987 charactershawks10, Apr 11, 2010

A: Pours a deep black, with an inch of brown head. The head itself looks very thick, but dissipates to half an inch after a few minutes. 
S: Smells like the bitter roast of coffee mixed with dark chocolate and sweet dark fruits.
T: The flavor is dominantly bitter dark chocolate. The front tastes like roasted coffee, while the middle tastes of the chocolate, and the sweetness of the fruit can be noticed on the ending note. This beer is slightly bitter on the tongue, but well balanced in flavor.

The head itself is frothy and creamy at the same time. Leaves very smooth and sticky lacing, paints the sides of the glass.
A very strong coffee bean aroma. A very faint fruit note, possibly cherry? Wow, when you take a long and slow whiff of this beer, the coffee aroma is awesome. Sweet and malty.
What complexity! Great coffee flavors, a medium roast, malty, chocolately, smooth and creamy, very slightly boozy. A little vanilla perhaps?? A great drinker! This goes down so smooth and easy. I'm very much impressed. Carbonation is medium to high, yet not overkill. Awesome beer! 821 charactersShadesOfGray, Apr 10, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A- Poured from the bottle with a thin foamy tan head, which quickly receded to a haze layer and collar. Little bits of lacing. The body was a completely opaque dark brown- almost black.
S- A big rich nose- predominantly coffee, with an undercurrent of rich roasted and crystal malts, and a mild herbal hop aroma.
T- A total roller coaster in the mouth. It starts out with a punch of fresh roasted coffee and grass, followed by a brief wave of rich crystal malt; this is immediately overtaken by a massive herbal hop bitterness, which evolves once again into a roasty fresh coffee bitterness. The finish is pleasantly dry with a lingering grassy flavor and a hop/roasty/quinine-like bitterness.
M- A medium-plus body, nicely textured- presumably from unattenuated sugar. There is some nice soft carbonation there as well. Slightly astringent.
D- A wonderfully stimulating beer, and the alcohol is very well hidden. Very drinkable given the high ABV. 952 charactersjgasparine, Apr 10, 2010

Poured a beautiful jet black color with an ample two finger tan head, however the head quickly dissipated into nothing. I am smelling heavy coffee and roasted flavors. The taste is heavy on the coffee/espresso flavors. A very nice tasting beer that has good balance to it. This was a very nice change from the beers I have been consuming recently. In my opinion this beer has lived up to the hype, the high ABV is well hidden behind the smooth nature of the beer. A very nice tasting beer. 556 characterscbros, Apr 10, 2010

The body is close to black, with a highly soapy looking tan head.
Aroma of used coffee grounds, smoke, oak, thank goodness I like coffee.
Very smoky flavor with only a latent finish of coffee. Burnt caramel, very nutty, dark nuts. A little sour.
Great thick mouthfeel, well carbonated and heavy yet balanced.
A little more hype than substance in my book, but overall respectable. I have just had so many awesome stouts recently that this one is hard to take notice to. 498 characterscnally, Apr 08, 2010

A - Poured pitch black, a deathly abyss, where nearly nothing shines through. A thick, tan, bubbly 2" head formed and left ample sheets of lace in the tulip. 4.0
S - A plethora aromas hit the nose quickly. Lots of coffee beans, roasted barley, and dark malts. A hint of prunes as well, with no alcohol detected. 4.5
T - Holy crap, this is intense. Huge, malty sweet forefront with lots of roasty malt character, some burnt marshmallows. Then comes the expresso beans and dark chocolate, rounding off the experience with some bittersweet notes and the warmth of a touch of alcohol. 5.0
M - This is very rich and smoothly carbonated. Warm finish, silky and coats the palate well. 5.0
D - I dear, I nearly ran out before I finished the review. 5.0
Overall - Wow, this is very different from any other beer I've ever had, yet it definitely has beer character. Like a cross between an RIS and a cup of black coffee. Moste Excellente x 2 966 charactersDmanGTR, Apr 07, 2010

Strong coffee and dark chocolate smell ... and taste, very heavy to drink but that makes her perfect for cold winter evenings ... though i can't drink more than one.

Finally getting around to reviewing this after having enjoyed it numerous times before. The pour generates a nearly two finger deep head of dense mocha colored foam that just sort of sits there for a while, in no rush to go down. The head also forms in a very interesting way, with the bubbles slowly creeping through the dense liquid up to the top. The body is super black with a fine ruby highlight around the edges. It leaves solid sheets of lace on the way down.
Nose is coffee. Lots and lots and lots of coffee. In multiple layers. Like how the hell did they stuff this many different coffee/espresso aromas into one beer. It's not really stout brewed with coffee, no, no, it's espresso brewed with imperial stout. Heavily (or heavenly) roasted espresso beans, dark cocoa drenched french blend coffee beans, a big/raw/intense roasted malt aroma. Some sweet sugary booze as well. I swear I smell oak, even though I am almost certain it's not aged. Oh well, my nose says it's in there. What this beer lacks in complexities it makes up in spades with a huge ham-fisted attack of coffee goodness. If you are into coffee (I love it) then this may be your Mecca.
Palette is bursting with coffee and roasted bitterness. And I swear there is some hop action going on as well, with a bit of pine needle and very faint grapefruit trying to get a little attention. It is short lived, the roasted espresso, nutty oak, and dark chocolate overpower it. And rightly so, this beer is all about the coffee. And there is a touch of unattenuated sweetness to hold it over from being overbearingly bitter and roasty.
The body of Peche is what you would expect on a beer with 13% ABV or more, it's just so heavy and robust. Chewy and almost syrupy, like a super condensed iced-coffee. A moderate rush of carbonation keeps things from getting too heavy, while keeping it at just the right level of density. 
The only reason I couldn't drink this all the time is the price. And I would likely get hammered off of the unapparent 9.5% ABV that doesn't even seem to exist except in a slight warming of the tongue. God I love this beer. 2,160 charactersFlashsp2, Apr 06, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Pitch black in the glass was topped off by a mocha colored compact head that displayed a fair retention while maintaining a thin skim coating. A moderate thin band for a lacing while an abundance of micro-bubbles sticks to the glass walls before being released into the wild. Dark, brooding and well suited visual appeal. 
S: Dark coffee with dried creamer is present on the nose with a medium sense of strength. Was expecting a bit more of a punch from an imperial but delivers with pretty good results. 
T: The flavor delivered a dense and dark roasted nature with a beautiful rich chocolate malting that absolutely delighted the taste buds. The coffee flavor is dominant with a dry roasty feel smothering the tongue while the bitterness level was well on par for imperial standards but remained eloquently smooth. The alcohol certainly stands out as well along with a smooth burnt bitterness of wood and afterthoughts of tobacco upon the swallow. The flavor certainly lives up to its billing with a dark roasted nature that is comparable to putting a wad of freshly roasted Columbia coffee beans in your mouth. 
M: The mouthful was medium full with a nice silky feel. The highlight is the tongue smothering dry roastiness that is rounded out by dry alcohol notes that stick around long after the swallow. 
D: If you love coffee in your beer then this is certainly the beer for you. I would be hard pressed to name another beer that has a more dominant coffee flavor then this. The beer slides down smoothly, but it is the aftertaste and lacing of the lingering dry roasty fade that provides pleasure long after its off your tongue. A rare treat that I certainly wish I cold indulge more into. A "mortal sin?", it would be to miss out on this one. 1,756 charactersbeerthulhu, Apr 05, 2010

a - Pours a dark brown color that lets no light through. Less than an inch of brown head, and no carbonation evident and no lacing.
s - Smells of coffee, roasted malts, and maybe a little bit of vanilla.
t - Taste is smooth coffe, roasted malts, and vanilla. Pretty nice.
m - Has high carbonation that stings the tongue a lot and medium to full body.
d - I thought this stout was pretty good but I personally like Aphrodisiaque MUCH more. It had a nice smooth coffee smell and taste but I thought the high carbonation hurt it. I would try it again but wouldn't seek it out; I'd much rather have Aphrodisiaque. 702 charactersmdfb79, Apr 03, 2010

A - Pours a deep brown, alomost balck, forming a thick 1 inch mocha head. Thick lacing coats the glass.
S - Strong roasted malt aroma with an equally strong espresso aroma. Foretells of the taste to come.
T - The coffee/espresso flavor coats the palate from the first sip. Very strong. The roasted malts are swirled thoughout the taste along with a nice bitter cocoa flavor. The coffee definitely dominates the taste on this one. Slight alcoholic presence in the finish.
M - Heavy bodied, good carbonation level, and a very smooth finish.
D - Great flavor and body. Easy drinkability considering the higher alcohol volume. Definitely a sipper and highly enjoyable. 711 charactersbeeragent, Apr 01, 2010

A- Pours with a thick mocha colored foam, that dissipates quickly. There is nice lacing throughout the glass. The beer itself is very dark, and pretty much pure black.
S- Smells of coffee and malt, with a stinging alcohol smell. Some light chocolate as well. The alchohol smell goes away a bit as it warms, but was a little strong at first.
T- Tastes primarily of coffee and dark malts. There is a slight bitterness and bite, but it got better as the beer warmed. Nice complexity to this one, I prefered it warm.
M- A little lacking in body, but very good none the less. 
D- Took me a while to get through this beer. Not sure if it was the combination of coffee and heavy alchohol, but it wasn't exactly a beer I raced through.
Would have again, definetely worthy of it's rating. All in all a good, but strong, coffee style stout 878 charactersGfunk720, Mar 26, 2010
4.06/5  rDev -7.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I had the opportunity to have this offering on tap at The Avenue Pub in New Orleans while on vacation. Poured from the tap into a freshly spritzed pint glass.
A: Pours a thick black with hints of dark chocolate and rich earthy hues. Light shines around this little lovely, not through it. A quarter inch head lingers for almost the entirety of this brew's pint life with solid lacing.
S: Smells of roasted molasses and crystal malts. Maybe I was having a bad nose day, but that's all I was really picking up...
T: Taste is sweet and crisp despite being a stout. Tastes of fine bourbon, oak and malts hit your taste buds in the fashion on an American Strong Ale but then comes the balancing hop bitterness. Super sweet for a stout but great nonetheless.
MF: Solid. Not too heavy and not too light. Slightly syrupy and a gooey brown sugar reminiscent taste and feel take it down smooth. 
D: Fantastic but highly unsessionable. One of these and a Stone Ruination and I was floating down the New Orleans streets for an hour. :)
The only drawback of this brew is its reputation. Its a great beer but its rep makes one feel as if Krishha is going to bestow sweet teat nectar if one drinks this on tap... Sweet teat nectar it is not. Good brew it is. 1,249 charactersseedsofchaos, Mar 26, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Served in a Dogfish Head snifter.
Although the darkness here is not as all-consuming as elsewhere, it's still definitely post-twilight here; a fresh bit of tan congregates at the surface, but in crescendo fashion falls back into the night, leaving a few stragglers behind, I'd assume to keep tabs on things. Though their activities remain mostly unknown (classified?), they're definitely drinking some dark roast, to the point that Matt Murdock hisself wouldn't be able to pick out much of anything else though some molasses and chocolate might penetrate those superhuman nostrils. From beneath their posts bursts forth such roasted coffee flavors as to expect a green and white label on the bottle. The bitterness runs a bit high, but not so much as to cause a cringe. The molasses and chocolate are just as discriminated against as before (when will we come to our senses?), but still make their voices heard amidst the throngs of beans, keeping the proceedings from breaking out in a caffeine-fueled riot. The crowd is not too thick, though it still ain't easy to push your way to the back; the members are pretty somber; and, despite the numbers, they're able to move around as a unit pretty easily. As peaceful and good-willed as things are, it might not be that easy to mill around all that often (so many people...). It all depends on personal preference toward the group's message, I'd say. 1,399 charactersTMoney2591, Mar 24, 2010

4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Tasted during a stout tasting for St. Paddy's day.
The beer pours a blackish, slighty hazy brow color with good head retention and lacing. The is impressive, especially if you enjoy coffee. There is a huge aroma of coffee grounds, coupled with underlying chocolate, cherry and a hint of leather. Flavor on the palate generally replicates the nose in this fairly sweet stout, though the coffee is dialed down a bit, something I appreciate. Still, there's a hint of bitterness from the coffee ground flavor, that goes nicely with the chocolate and sweetness in this beer. Mouthfeel is pretty full, with a fairly long, drawn out finish. There's also something of a creamy booziness that I very much like. Drinkability is pretty good, with the alcohol pretty well disguised. 
Just an all around nice beer. 803 charactersJohn_M, Mar 17, 2010
4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Possibly the first craft beer I bought knowing it was craft. Was a huge challenge to drink at the time. Let's see how drinkable it is now.
A- Cappuccino froth looking head. Pitch black. The only dark brown is right under the head when held up right next to the light. Nice thin string of lacing all around.
S- Quite cold now and gives me watermelon flavored Airhead candy which is really weird. I wonder if anybody else gets that. What's more obvious is coffee grounds and alcohol. Creamy, milky vanilla. A little chocolate. Warming up, the watermelon turned into a more hmmm... expected maraschino cherry. The alcohol smell gets pretty strong once the drink's warmed up. 
T- Really tastes like coffee. A great tasting iced coffee actually. 9.5% is very hard to find in the taste. Cocoa powder seems to lend taste and some of the bitterness. Sweeter than a lot of other stouts I've had the chance to try. The after-taste is almost identical to one you get after drinking a good espresso. Plus a bit of alcohol numbness. I think what could help make this better for me is a little less sourness though I'm not sure it is possible. That sour character seems like an important part of both a stout and an espresso. Still tastes delicious.
M- Pretty smooth. I wouldn't say it's watery but it does seem to lack a little body. Loses carbonation quickly: starts off prickly and medium but dies down to sub-low levels. Quite silky.
D- One pint is delicious but enough. Maybe two...
I now see what's so special about this one and am sure I will buy it again. I'd love to try it with some good food. Grilled meat is my first thought but anything really. It will probably keep growing on me. 1,686 charactersYoonisaykul, Mar 17, 2010

T: A splash of alcohol up front but then the dance of the coffee beans begins: and boy, is she a fun partner. The coffee completely overwhelms your senses--and did I mention how good this coffee is. As the coffee finally settles down you get a slight taste of a smoky meatiness as well.

Nice lacing all the way down the class. And the color--pitch black through and through. If the beer tastes even half as good as it looks, it will be superb!
Aromas what you would expect...black coffee, roasted malts, licorice. Not overdone, but very nice.
Taste was like a black coffee milkshake. Very pronounced coffee flavors balanced by enough sweet malt to even it out. But it is not a sweet beer by any stretch. Alcohol slightly evident, but mostly hides in the background.
I think I liked the mouthfeel of this beer better than any I have ever tried! Rich, thick, chewy, creamy, satisfying, coats the tongue yet leaves a clean finish. Warming going down, yet not overly heavy either Spectacular!!
Overall I was not disappointed by this treasure. I am so glad I found it while on a trip to Boulder. Not inexpensive at around $6 a 11.5 oz bottle, but well worth it. 983 charactersdoppelmeup, Mar 16, 2010

Pours a jet black nectar with a beautiful, pillowy, moderate brown head. The head reminds me of a freshly brewed espresso shot that remains throughout my enjoyment of this beer. As the beer warms, moderate lacing remains on the edges of my glass.
S: Lots of espresso with hints of chocolate and a little wood? Surprising because the beer wasn't aged in wood.
T: Automatic coffee and espresso, which is not surprising due to this beverage being brewed with fair trade coffee. I also detected chocolate, toffee, and raisin throughout the tasting.
M: Very full, creamy, and definitely delectable. Does a great job hiding the 9.5% abv. This could be dangerous.
D: Smooth and creamy. Definitely did not disappoint one of my favorites of the genre. Overall, a magnificent beer and did not disappoint. My only qualm was paying $6.50 for a 11.5 oz. bottle. Would love to get my hands on a barrel aged version. 1,002 charactersZippie9999, Mar 15, 2010

Pours jet black with a one finger tan head on top. Resides to a donut of foam up against the sides of the glass and a layer of foam in the middle that covers about half the beer. Very impressive lacing.
Intensely roasty and smokey nose. Smells of coffee, dark chocolate, and caramel sweetness.
Flavor starts off with roasted maltiness evoking dark chocolate and smoke. Gives way to a robust coffee flavor. A bit of a caramel/vanilla sweetness to it as well. Leaves a smokey coffee aftertaste. Becomes more smokey/roasty/coffee bitter and loses some of the sweetness as the beer warms (or perhaps as my palate becomes saturated with its flavor).
I would call this medium bodied, which I find surprising. Not incredibly chewy or viscous for the style. Medium carbonation with tiny prickly bubbles. 
Very drinkable for the abv. Overall, a fantastic coffee infused stout. 990 charactersbillshmeinke, Mar 14, 2010

Very defined coffee aroma mimmicing a nice cup of joe. Hints of spent coffee grinds, some bitter chocolate aromas with toasted grains.
A quick shot of sweet buttery toffy flavors with bitter chocolate notes to follow. An onslought of espresso flavors come on strong. A bit much in my opinion. Slight bitterness fades to a toasted hazelnut flavor with a alchol sensation.
Drink is true to the style, big chewy body with modest alchol burn in mouth.
This offering earned its respect as being in the top 100. Best as a desert brew. Drink suffers a bit from the dominate coffee flavors, but worthy. 691 charactersFishGetter, Mar 10, 2010

Pours black with a one-finger brown head. The head recedes into a thin layer on top leaving thick lacing.
Smells of equal parts smooth roasted malts and rich dark chocolate. Also present are solid amounts of coffee however it seems much more muted on tap than I remember from the bottle.
Tastes very good. Smooth roasted malt flavors up front that are quickly tempered by loads of dark chocolate flavors. Midway through the sip a mild bitterness comes in with coffee undertones. The mild coffee flavors carry through to a mildly bitter finish.
Mouthfeel is very good. It's got a smooth thickness with grainy carbonation.
Drinkability is also very good. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have a few more.
Overall this really is one of the best "pure" American Double Stouts (if there is such a thing). Loads and loads of dark chocolate and roasted flavors backed up by mild coffee flavors. Definitely worth a shot. 957 charactersglid02, Mar 10, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pitch black with tight tan head. It smells of wonderfully intense coffee. The taste is of a bitter coffee flavour with the roasted malt. The alcohol in the taste is present, as you'd expect with 9.5% abv. The carbonation is a little bit too much for me, as I'd prefer a little smoother, but I just love sipping on this. I am biased on this as a coffee lover. If you do not like coffee, you may want to stay away. 
I have had this on cask as well, but I was drinking way too much to properly review it then. On cask it is amazingly smooth and possibly the best stout I've ever had. 581 characterskwjd, Mar 09, 2010

enjoyed while brewing up a delightful centennial fresh hop. in the sunny pac-nw, it is coffee time. every time i bring the glass near my face its like getting back into a car with a newly purchased bag of coffee strung up from the rear view mirror. just breath in deeply. i hesitate to take even the first sip. the smell is too amazing. when i do, i am slightly let down before realizing it is still very delicious, a little on the sweet side, with plenty of coffee flavor. i can taste the sweat of the harvesters. a hint of chocolate, though that may just be from the coffee itself. some faint esters hide in the background, building character. 
delightful, a beer that surely put us on the path to success with our most efficient mash ever. 767 charactersolympuszymurgus, Mar 06, 2010
3.98/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Purchased a bottle of this during a recent trip to the Northeast. Split with friends during, what ended up being, a stout tasting after a day of snowboarding. 
Poured into my Porstmouth snifter. Dark, dark brown. A thick-looking beer that piled up into the glass, leaving a two finger light brown head. Fairly quickly, this dissipated to a thin lining over the top of my beer. Plenty of lacing left throughout this one!
I can't get over the smell of coffee / espresso in this beer. It has lapped the field in regards to the aroma. There is a little alcohol punch in there as well and maybe a bit of chocolate or herb in there, but frankly, this is one of the most coffee-heavy smelling beers around.
The taste of Peche Mortel is not surprising after taking a whiff. Dark roasted malts lead into a strongly brewed heavy coffee. It does end with a nice sweeter finish that isn't bitter and not hot. A decently thick, low-carbonation mouthfeel makes this an even better beer to drink. A bit too much coffee for me, so one was plenty, but I was surprisingly pleased with how this one finished off.
Overall, a very solid beer. Great to pass around with several others, and one that would truly be enjoyed by any coffee-lover.

Coffee, obviously, but with the intensity of espresso, and finishes like a mocha frappuccino. Also somewhat soapy on the finish. There is definitely some heat and bitterness to this beer, yet it is absurdly smooth and creamy, which is what separates it from the other big coffee stouts.
Huge complexity, bold yet inviting. 462 charactersoceanman, Mar 04, 2010
4.05/5  rDev -8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Funny thing about this beer is that back in 2008, I tried it. I just came in contact with craft beers and wanted to taste something out of this world. This was out of this world. I disliked it so much! Not that I preferred those yellow fizzy beers, but it was a little bit too much for my taste buds which were starting to like the IPA and ESB Beers...
Tried again tonight (in 2010 after the Canada wins at the 2010 olympic).
A: The beer appearance is dark, very dark black color with a nice head. So dark I can't see through the beer.
S: Wow, chocolate and coffee. Very intense notes of coffee. Some alcohol notes too. Expected from a 9.5% ABV beer.
T: Again intense! Coffee with some chocolate. The bitterness is from the coffee grains. Very nice notes of coffee.
M: Pretty dense in the mouth, very complex too. A little bit too much carbonation.
D: This is a sipper. I couldn't get 2 of this one in one evening. However, it is nice to drink in one evening. Thus the drinkability is below good. 998 charactersZorPrime, Mar 01, 2010

S - Coffee hits on the nose. Slight chocolate and a deep oakey smell that kind of surprised me. Almost a little porter-esque with exceptionally more roast to it. Some unidentifiable fruit smell comes through as well.
T - After reading the reviews, I'm obviously in the minority on this one, but I was not a fan. Bad bottle maybe? Way too oakey on this one, really killed the bear for me. Get the nice coffee and roasted malt with some chocolate highlights but the woody taste wrecks it. Don't really care much for this.

A- Black as night with huge three finger thick mocha head. No light passes through it at all. Beautiful.
S- A quick whiff of almost banana before it morphed into roasted coffee with just a hint of chocolate behind it. 
T- Starts as a soft, smooth balance of flavors which slowly builds in coffee intensity as it slides across the roof of the mouth right into the swallow and aftertaste. The coffee lingers for several minutes (if you can wait that long between sips!). While the coffee flavor is strong, it never strayed into that bitterness that sometimes happens when the balance is off.
M- Full, lush, rich, soft, smooth, luxurious. So well balanced; fantastic!
D- The alcohol content is extremely well hidden, never showing itself during any point in the swallow. It's so good you might want to have more than one a night, yet it's so good you also might want to savor each sip! The 9.5% might be a little daunting for a session beer.
It might be a little off putting for some to pay $5-7 for the small bottle, but it is definitely worth the price. Will be picking more of this up as soon as humanly possible! 1,181 charactersshellebrownies, Feb 24, 2010

4.49/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5&I made a trip to Quebec today and had had had to grab this beer. 
Spoiler Alert!
 IT IS UNBELIEVABLE
Appearance: this is the darkest imp stout i have seen. Its so black that it seems to reject the concept of opacity and go for impossibility for light to escape its grasp. Literally no light can make it through. I love it. The head was very weak though. As in a couple bubbles. That is it. I dont care though. Its soo good it doesnt matter
Smell: Plum, raisin, brown sugar, molasses... The smell is good. Not as much roasted aroma as i expected. I though the imperialness with a kick of coffee would smash my nostrils with the scent of roasted coffee / chocolate / hops. This did not happen and, to be perfectly honest, i got scared. Oh no, please dont let this be one of those over-hyped under-performing beer! ... keep reading
Taste: Mind blowing. The first sip did not allow me to appreciate the complexity. This beer requires a bit more persistence than others, but its well worth it. The lack of smell is made up for by the truly rich flavours present in the taste. The coffee roast hops are present. The high alcohol is subtly available but masked by a delicious sweetness that i feel is characterized best as plum. And best of all, when you think its all over, and its time to take another sip.... DONT. wait for the amazing aftertaste to mature and present a new perspective on the flavour. 
Mouthfeel: Smooth as glass. Ive had over carbonated stouts and burning unfortunately flavoured imperials but this 'mortal sin' does not fall to either of these blunders. 
Drinkability: With a high alcohol comes limited drinkability. This is a fact of life. That said, within the 8-10% alcohol range, this is probably one of, if not the most drinkable beers available. I like to take it slow with this one. Not even because its strong, cause the force isnt felt so much in each sip, but because it allows a much fuller enjoyment of the beer as the flavours settle on the palate and deliver a robust enjoyment even in the aftertaste phase.
---
SO in conclusion, the absolute best canadian beer available. Hands down. In my extremely humble opinion this beer can deliver on par with the trappist Belgians. Probably it will never be popularly seen that way (too new world yet not american) but its a contender. Ive never had a beer that i have enjoyed as much from sip to savour to settling flavour. Truly outstanding. 2,422 charactersascrivens, Feb 23, 2010

Aroma is imperial stout and coffee. Flavor is extremely well balanced coffee imperial stout: fresh dark roast coffee, black patent malt, chocolate malt, dark ripe fruits, caramel, toffee, burnt sugar,cocoa, yeast, and a bit of hop. Body is unusually smooth for this kind of beer and has very good carbonation. Finish is lightly alcoholic for as strong as it is and thre is a nice long lingering bitter/sweetness. Very finely crafted beer. A real masterpiece. Dangerous in a way as it's so well done and balanced you could easily knock back enough to get knocked out. 691 charactersdrpimento, Feb 23, 2010

Smells strongly of roasted coffee with a bit of sweetness.
The flavor is a little sweet up front, but mostly roast malts. The roasted coffee flavor really starts to come through in the middle with some bitterness. The finish is a roasted coffee bitterness that lingers nicely. 
Mouthfeel is full bodied with a very slight chewyness. Pleasantly low carbonation despite the active head.
Drinkability is great--really good bitter coffee flavor, without overpowering the palate. Very enjoyable. 576 characterssidetracked, Feb 22, 2010

A- an ample amount of light brown head for the style. average to good lacing and head retention. pours coffee black which is expectable for a coffee beer. no light coming through the darkness
S- such an amazing smell for a beer. smells like walking into a gourmet coffee shop. bursting of intense roasted aromas. more espresso than coffee. this stuff stomps the shit out of your eye opening cup of foldgers. don't even pick this up if you don't love roasty stouts...save it for me.
T- almost total espresso goodness. the bready malt profile and carbonation really sets it apart from your standard coffee. I love these Stout/coffee borderline beers. truly taking advantage perfect pairing of Imperial Stout and coffee drink. 
M- thick and mouth coating. the added coffee even plays apart in this aspect of the beer. it really thins it out a bit but the base beer holds up really well and stays full bodied enough to

A- Deep ebony black, practically no light coming through except on the edges with a very well defined tan head.
S- Solid coffee and chocolate with a hint of roasted malt. Actually smells like a strong cup of coffee
T-Much like the aroma, this is like drinking a cup of coffee. Since I usually put cream and sugar in my cop o' joe I thought "Wow, this is so good it doesn't need that addition". Great bitter finish, some booziness but in a good way. My life would be great if I could replace my morning coffee with this instead.

Sits a near pitch black with some cola colored edges. A dark khaki head rose two fingers and fell quickly to form a thin collar. Some minor, delicate lace.
When I first leaned in, port wine and dark fruit hit me hard. Fresh roasted coffee and bakers chocolate hold their own along with black strap molasses. 
This beer grew on me the more it warmed. It opened up considerably. Plums and cherries, port wine, fresh roasted coffee grounds, and semi sweet chocolate. Well-rounded, not overly broad but very deep and rich.
Creamy, lush medium mouthfeel that feels a lot lighter than it really is. A moderate amount of booze lingers and mixes with coffee oils for a unique finish.
A pleasure to drink. Robust and rich but never overbearing. There is a reason why this beer is held in high regard. 836 charactersColForbinBC, Feb 14, 2010

A- Pours a deep dark black color. Two finger mocha colored head comes up and stays for a short while. Lacing clung to the sides of the glass looking all sexy like. Good looking stout.
S- This smells like cold black coffee. Big roasted front on this that pretty much takes over everything. Maybe a light chocolate note in the far end of the aroma but for the most part big huge roasted coffee malt smell. 
T- Once again this is like drinking a cold cup of coffee but better! Big roasted malts in the front end of this beer break way to a light bittersweet chocolate taste in the middle. This again takes over into the coffee taste again. Not as bursting with coffee flavor as the aroma would suggest but still a coffee dropkick on the palate. 
M- Heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for the style although I could have used a little more. Roasted malts left on the palate and dominate the aftertaste. Slick oily residue left all over the palate with this beer. Drying on the tongue as I finish a sip.
D- Good drinkability that I really enjoy. This is a very coffee forward stout that I would recommend to actual coffee drinkers. The ABV limits this one per say but I would have no problem either having it as a night cap or two of them in a row before going onto something else. 1,340 charactersalleykatking, Feb 14, 2010
3.87/5  rDev -12%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Been looking forward to this one since I picked it up at Christmas time. Pours deep black with a light mocha head which left strong lacing at first, but over time left nothing. A nice nose with chocolate dominating and coffee lying beneath it. Upon sipping it though I was disappointed, it is good, just not the ridiculously super good it had been pumped up to be. The coffee is mellow with a rich chocolate malt brew that leaves a bitter finish. Feels too light though, and the carbonation was low. Quite sip-able, just not as mind blowing as I had been expecting. 565 characterskjyost, Feb 13, 2010
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5300 mL bottle with no discernable freshness date. Pours a black, but not overly viscous, color with a few highlights showing only at the bottom of a lambic flute. Foam is medium brown and displays very nice retention and lacing considering the style and ABV. Lacing is average at best.
Nose is pretty big as plenty of lightly roasted coffee, milk chocolate and almond nuttiness come through. There is some dark cherry fruitiness I get as well. Smells pretty damn good.
Taste is very nice as well with a nice balance of roasty coffee, vanilla-almond nuts, strawberry-esque fruit and edgy alcohol. Body is not as creamy as I would like in a stout this big, but that is a pretty minor complaint. I would recommend not adding the yeast at the bottom of this one, as it imparts a bit of a sawdust feel and taste to the beer. Very, very good beer, might not be able to hang with the best of the best...but it is not very far behind either. 935 characterstwiggamortis420, Feb 13, 2010
4.21/5  rDev -4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into a snifter.
Rich, dark black pour. Three fingers of fluffy cocoa-colored foam spill out over the top of the glass. Head resembles chocolate mousse, or maybe the bit of foam you'd get at the top of hot chocolate. Tons of lacing stuck to the glass. This is a perfect looking stout.
Smells like a mug of black coffee. Intense roasty nose. Roast, bittersweet chocolate, ground coffee beans. Again, it's intense.
As I take my first sip, I can't even begin to think about the flavor because I'm so blown away by the texture. But more on that later. The flavor is almost entirely coffee, but it's not nearly as in-your-face as the aroma, which is a good thing for me. The coffee still dominates, but not in a way that's harsh or unpleasant. Some rich chocolate gives a nice bittersweet flavor. Dry bitter finish.
It's hard to describe what I like about the texture of this beer...it's not perfect to style, but I'm really enjoying it. It's got a big body without being overly thick. It seems highly-carbonated, yet still feels soft, plush, and velvety. It's ridiculously smooth despite having such an intense flavor profile. Lingering finish. Again, it's not perfect, but let's just say that it works for me.
ABV is never a factor. This one went down much quicker than I expected it to. Just a really impressive beer. I'm not a coffee guy at all, but I highly enjoyed this one. 1,400 charactersGyle41386, Feb 13, 2010

Lacings slides quickly but leaves a thin film of oily resin on the glass. Aroma is of chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, some alcohol and some hops. Taste follows suit, mainly with a coffee/chocolate taste dominating. This one gets noticeably more delicious as the beer is allowed to warm. Can't wait to put a bit of age on a few of these. Awesome experience. 463 charactersKickbacksSteve, Feb 12, 2010

T: Heavy bitter coffee assault on the mouth! Very roasty with a little chocolate in there, but more roasted coffee bean than bittersweet chocolate. Finish is long and bitter.
M: Not thick, but pretty chewy and very lightly carbonated.
Very good coffee stout. I prefer several that have more roasted malt to go with all the coffee, but this is a pretty enjoyable option to sip on. 667 charactersGeezLynn, Feb 12, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I picked up this bottle at Monument Liquor in Concord, as it unfairly is only available in the northern area of the fair state of California.
Pours black with a large and dense brown head, fairly big for a strong ale. Good retention and lacing displayed with dense bubbles. Strong coffee aroma, bordering on acidic, and also some roasted barley, bitter chocolate, some licorice, mild cookie dough action. 
The taste begins with a rush of fresh coffee, dry, but decadent. The taste is quite intense, nicely balanced with malt, but the sugar levels in check to let the coffee take center stage here. Hints of dark fruit on the midpalate, but it is fleeting, then some flora actually shows up. All of the bitterness seems to be coming from the fair trade coffee rather than hops as well. The finish leaves a lasting sweet coffee and cookie dough flavor that layers on the decadence of this brew. It makes coffee taste better than it tastes by itself.
Full bodied with moderate carbonation that feels plentifully robust. Definitely a coffee bomb, and quite a delicious example of one. It's hard to make a specific complaint against this brew, but it definitely elevates coffee beer to high levels, above the rest of it. I probably shouldn't be drinking this at night. 1,266 charactersvacax, Feb 09, 2010

S- Really smoky and roasted, almost burnt. Freshly roasted coffee beans, hint of dark chocolate, and molasses. Really an exceptional smelling beer. Slight alcohol scent.
T- Bitter initially, seems to be more of a roasted malt bitter. Not the slightest bit sweet, very dry and up front. There is a definite coffee taste, with a slight chocolate touch in the finish.
M- Really thick and although it tastes dry to begin with it finishes super slick and sticky. Nice warming quality.
D- Really drinkable I'm shocked to see that it's 9% (I figured it out after I finished it), this one will sneak up on you if you aren't careful. 768 charactersbrow1901, Feb 09, 2010
4.17/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a bottle without a born on date into a tulip glass. Beer is black and forms a delayed brown head of small bubbles that falls away rather quickly leaving some lacing on the glass. Carbonation is moderate to weak.
Aroma is strong, coffee and sweetness. Some sweetness from alcohol, other from some malt. There is some burnt malt aroma as well.
I think I started drinking this beer too cold. I was really hit hard with an ash-like flavor when I started, but as it warmed up it became much more balanced. Beer is medium bodied, strong coffee roastiness. There is a definite alcohol flavor up front and some malt syrup sweetness. Overall, it was pretty good, not my favorite coffee stout though. 704 charactersdrabmuh, Feb 08, 2010
4.06/5  rDev -7.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 411.5 oz TWIST OFF (shame on Dieu Du Ciel).
Pours a dense black with only ruby on the edges. The head is billowing and tan, it takes awhile to recede and leaves gorgeous and thick lacing.
The smell is mostly coffee witch dark, roasty malts.n Theres also some sugary chocolate but no sign of hops. It goes halfway to where breakfast stouts go smell wise, coffee dominates.
The mouthfeel is thick and under-carbonated but the flavor is huge. It is sweeter than I expected with the alcohol being well in the mix as it covers the mouth and throat. The coffee is large, the roasted malt is large, and there is also a good amount of bittersweet chocolate and dark fruits. 
This is a good stout, perhaps not worth 6 bucks but it is Canadian so it is reasonable I guess. 765 characterscrossovert, Feb 08, 2010

4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: 12 oz. bottle poured into an Allagash tulip glass. Labelled as an "Imperial Coffee Stout."
Appearance - Dark brown to black, opaque and thick, with a one and a half finger head. Below average retention.
Aroma - Bitter coffee and espresso notes hit first. Burnt sugar and some sweetness also come through. Almost no noticable booze.
Taste - Coffee and espresso is full force upfront. Bitterness lingers throughout each sip. Burnt sugar adds a little sweetness and a lot of char here. The coffee/espresso dominates throughout though and doesn't allow many other flavors to come through.
Mouthfeel - Chewy and slight creamy. Rather full bodied without much carbonation.
Drinkability - The ABV is almost unnoticable throughout this beer. The bitterness could make this less drinkable though.
Overall, a reallly good coffee stout, but with too much coffee and not enough balance throughout. ABV is extremely well hidden, but the bitterness can wear thin quickly. Even as a coffee lover, I found this beer to be a bit one dimensional. 1,048 charactersGosox8787, Feb 06, 2010

Poured rather aggressively causing only a small 1/8" inch tan head. Not too thick on the pour. The head dissipates quickly leaving almost no traces of retention.
On the nose in order of dominance are heavy roasted malt, dark red licorice, leather and coffee. Alcohol very well hidden.
Even more roasted malts in the taste than I was suspecting. Fine coffee taste adds a pleasant bitterness to this big malt bomb.
Full bodied and moderately thick going down. Minimal carbonation. A gritty, coating finish keeps the malts going for quite a while.
All an all a great example of the style that I'd recommend for any beer lover to try. 741 charactersibbjamin, Feb 02, 2010
4.11/5  rDev -6.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to FooFaa for the bottle.
Pours a declicous looking black with a big poof of tan head, great lacing and lots of retention.
Light coffe and roast malt in the nose, VERY restrained aroma for such a big beer.
Flavor is a roast sweetness with a little coffe, slight balancing bitterness, leaves a little bit of a harsh bitter bite on the tongue.
Probably not my favorite coffe stout, but definetly one to try, very tasty. 428 charactersSShelly, Feb 02, 2010
4.36/5  rDev -0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 11.2oz. bottle into a Blue Point snifter. 
A: Vigorous pour yields a 2 finger semi-coarse deep chocolate head that holds steady at about .5 fingers. Beer is opaque black and thick. Lacing is frothy, like a painted tidal wave of brown on the side of my glass. 
S: Roasted dark chocolate, slightly sour coffee, hint of milkiness and spice that tickles the nose. Very volatile and strong. I can smell this one a mile away. Booziness is present but well hidden.
T: Opens coffee, sweet chocolate, liquorice, lively dark fruit that doesn't crush the rest of the flavor. A slightly sweet and sour coffee lingers throughout. Tobacco, leather all contribute but in a well balanced manner. Finish is sticky dark fruit with a kick of spiciness to end. 
M: Opens very coarse but smooths out quickly. Medium bodied. Not oily, slightly sticky, and finishes messy, leaving a film in my mouth. A bit too carbonated for me though but it certainly enhances the experience. 
D: An infinitely complex brew that displays such depth of character because its soooo balanced with a body that integrates yet lets me distinguish the many different flavors present. This one is a sipper though, not because its hot or boozy, but because its just really enjoyable. Completely under-rated imperial stout. This is a definite winner. 1,321 charactersSpeedwayJim, Feb 01, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a snifter. Formed a two finger cocoa powder colored head. Quick dissipation leaving behind very little lace. The body is solid and black; like someone painted the inside of my glass with ebony enamel. 
The nose has dark chocolate and freshly ground coffee up front. The backbone is roasted malts. Not as strong as I would have expected...
Wow...waves of complex flavors sweep across the palate. Bitter baker's chocolate gives way to an even more bitter coffee/mocha flavor. This fades into a roasted malt finish. The aftertaste is the best part of this drink...fresh ground coffee...almost breathtaking!
Medium mouth feel, creamy with mild carbonation.
Very drinkable! The ABV is hidden very, very well. This beer has moved to the top of my list for this style! 777 charactersmgbickel, Feb 01, 2010
4.84/5  rDev +10%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Pours very black with a medium brown fluffy head. Moderate lacing.
Smells of burnt malts and thick, dense coffee grounds.
A profound coffee/espresso flavor masks a heavy burnt malt/burnt wood flavor. Behind that lies a solid chocolate malt and some mild spices.
Medium in body with a heavy dose of carbonation. The carbonation serves to accent the coffee/burnt flavors heavily.
This was a major surprise. I had heard about this one, but had never really given it much thought until I realized I knew the name when looking in the store. Fantastic coffee flavor in this one, moreso than I could have imagined, yet its not as overwhelming as the first sip, and really ends up fantastically easy to down. Not even a hint of the 9.5% alcohol really, its hidden behind that massive coffee and malt explosion. Excellent brew I *will* be revisiting. 845 characterssevopie, Jan 26, 2010

Pours jet black, seems even darker than many big imperial stouts. Not much head, still exciting. Smell is of roasted malts and coffee very smooth. Taste is again dark malt, coffee, and some silky dark chocolate. Very good taste coffee and roasted flavor are very prominent and well blended. Moutfeel is thick very oily, but not at all in a bad way. Drinkability is excellent. Extremely smooth for a big imperial stout. 495 characterspdoran10, Jan 24, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My favourite beer. You gotta like imperial stout though. It's almost closer to an espresso than a beer. Everything is great from the strong coffee smell to its incredible taste. It could have had a little more body. Otherwise, an incredible beer. I yet have to find a better imperial stout. 290 charactersnicpetit, Jan 23, 2010

S-the nose is big and beautiful, it brings loads of espresso and milk chocolate with a hint of caramel. i get a touch of dark fruit at the very back but it is so faint
T-the taste is extremely big as well. it brings a bold flavor of roasted espresso. there is some bitter sweet chocolate and a hint of milk chocolate. there is that touch of dark fruit to sweeten up this big roasted espresso beer at the finish. the booze is noticable but not overpowering at all.
M-lighter side of a full body, very thick and smooth, a good amount of carbonation.
D-this is so tasty and big, smooth and creamy. give me more! 777 characterscpetrone84, Jan 23, 2010
3.35/5  rDev -23.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2With all the rave reviews on this beer I am very excited for this review and I have waited a while as this bottle has some definite age on it from the cellar, which I had tried one fresh to compare but was only able to get my hands on one bottle so here we go!
Appearance- very dark black, no light coming through this sucker, pours a very beautiful tan head that sits peacefully on top, slight bubbles sit on bottom of the glass good appearance,
Smell- highly arromatic, a total coffee and espresso bomb off the nose, if you put this in front of me I would never know this was anything at all but a cup of coffee, wow powerful smell,
Taste- rich espresso and coffee flavor just absolutely dominate the flavor, closes out with strong bitter hoppy finish, but i mean the final taste and overall taste can only be described as coffee, you can certainly tell they are using plenty coffee in the brewski, to my tastes and I have to admit I am not a huge huge coffee fan though its complex its very unbalanced to the point i almost forget im drinking beer, but complexity is clearly there
Mouthfeel- heavy rich and viscous on the mouthfeel, yet still has a very smooth feel to it
Drinkability- To me this beer is taxing to drink, just too much unbalanced coffee dominating every aspect, its also extremely heavy and daunting, would take me few hours to probably finish this whole thing, i guess maybe if you were a coffee fanatic you would be rating drinkability certainly quite higher then i am, something i am glad i got to try and though i appreciate its complexity just nothing id go crazy looking for again, 1,612 charactersStunner97, Jan 22, 2010
4.78/5  rDev +8.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I picked this beer up on a whim as I was in the mood for a good coffee stout and the siren-like figure somehow told me this is the beer for you. A bit freaky, but I went with it. Wow. I was impressed from the very first pour. Like any stout, the color is a dark molasses black. But...the head was thick and dense with good retention. The coffee aroma was intense! The roasted goodness almost overwhelms my sense of smell. The roasted coffee flavors are the first things that I could taste along with hints of chocolate. However, I can tell there's more complexity here than my palette can decipher. The coffee flavors bring bitterness but it's not over powering as the sweetness of the malt cuts the bitterness quite nicely. 
The beer has carbonation but once the bubbles have escaped the beer gives a creamy, velvety feel and finish.
The alcohol was very well hidden in this beer which is scary. This is an amazing coffee stout. It is a very drinkable beer as it does not leave your mouth feeling bitter and dry; it only leaves it wanting more. 1,045 charactersBeerInReview, Jan 21, 2010

body- dry, slightly astringent, well balanced, smooth finish, medium-weight palette
appearance- opaque, dark, dirty-colored head, little retention and lace.
overall impression- very exciting beer from the aroma, to the mouthfeel, to the taste. probably the best executed "coffee-infused stout" i have tried...refined yet appropriately daring
notes and comments- pronounced roasted flavors, strong coffee taste, pair with chocolate immediately!

3.83/5  rDev -13%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 2.5Aroma- Earthy, deep carab, chocolate, a hint of acridity gives it an edge, deep and layered, but tight and not jumping out of the glass
Appearance- Thin, dark espresso head leaves no lace.
Taste- Coffee flavor is there, in tandem with a strong dark chocolate character. There is some residual sweetness to this beer, but it is a low base flavor. Doesn't come close to being a milk stout. A little molasses or sourghum flavor begins to hang on the palate in the aftertaste with continued sipping.
Mouthfeel- Very long finish is the only place where alcohol is detectable along with an astringency from the dark malts and maybe coffee. Sounds unpleasant, but kind of dries off the palate for the next sip. I would call this a full bodied beer with a silky mouth feel.
Overall- This is very well-made beer. It is a unique Imperial Stout with a very focused emphasis on a couple of flavors. It is an intense sipping beer that may not be for everyone and would probably be best paired with some kind of dessert or even, dare I say it, tobacco. If you are the kind of person who spends 8 bucks on designer chocolate at the healthfood store, you'll probably love this. 1,165 charactersJudgeRoughneck, Jan 18, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A= pours a pitch black color with a small half finger head on it that despite it's size keeps good retention not falling much lower than the half finger throughout the drink. Some spotty lacing on it could be better.
S= Loads of coffee. One of the most coffee based beers I've ever smelled. Very strong imperial stout aroma. Tons of chocolate and toffee. Some alcohol is in it but it's hidden by the other roasty notes. I can tell it's in there because it burns my nose a little. Really malty smelling. Smells thick if that makes sense.
T= The coffee is toned down a bit in the taste. I feel like these flavors are so intense this beer should have a higher alcohol level. Really intense roasty malt and of course chocolate and coffee. I taste a lot more dark chocolate than I expected. I've heard this is a super coffee beer but the coffee is not as intense as I was suspecting. Lots of roasted malt in it.
M= thick and coating. A little burn on the tongue but in my opinion just as coating as some of the larger stouts like dark lord. chewy as hell. I love it.
D= Awesome brew. The fact that I picked this up locally is really nice. This beer rivals some of the more famed stouts namely Dark Lord. If DL had coffee in it I think it would taste like this beer. Intense flavor and an awesome showcase of thick roasty malts. 1,326 charactersjjanega08, Jan 18, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Opened my first of two bottles last night, poured in a Dogfish Head Signature Glass (large snifter style). Black with a thick finger of foamy head. Heavy film on the glass as the head dissapated.
Amazing smells- coffee, chocolate, vanilla. Even though I expected it to be going into the first sip (based on other reviews) I didn't find the coffee taste to be too strong- nicely subtle, and nicely woven with chocolate. Very smooth stout- almost silky. This was very enjoyable sipping slowly- in fact to drink this too fast would be a crime, as there are a world of flavors here.
The alcohol content does not show itself in the taste- very good balance. If you are a stout aficionado, this is a must try. 705 charactersCraftAleRookie, Jan 18, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Stone RIS glass. Pours black wit ha small off-white head. The head dissipated and clung to the sides of the glass, but left moderate lacing on the side of the glass.
Aroma is big on roasted grains, coffee and chocolate with a little vanilla. Coffee is very present in the taste, it starts off relatively mild but comes through heavy in a long lasting bitter finish. Some chocolate and roasted grains are also present but there won't be any mistaking this for anything other then a coffee flavored beer. The coffee taste reminds me a lot of Breakfast Stout.
Mouthfeel is thick with moderate to low carbonation. Drinkability is good, I really enjoyed this one. It's strong but the alcohol is well hidden. The coffee comes through very well and isn't overbearing, and the mouthfeel is very good. I very good beer in my opinion. 860 charactersbillab914, Jan 16, 2010

A - pour yields over two fingers of light tan foam, super frothy and thick...resembles a Wendy's Frosty. Lacing is crazy, covering the sides of the glass with a thin film the whole way down. The beer is pitch black with some bubbles sticking to the sides of the glass.
S - loads of fresh (and very strong) roasted espresso, other notes of chocolate, oak, vanilla beans, and some faint hops.
T - coffee off the bat but isn't overwhelming...joined by bitter chocolate, hops, and oak. just a hint of alcohol near the end. 
M - incredibly creamy but with some carbonation to liven it up. flavors just dance around until the swallow, followed by a pleasant yet bittering aftertaste.
D - downright delicious and complex, yet no-fuss. one of the best beers i've ever had, and certainly a world-class coffee stout. 854 charactersStigs, Jan 16, 2010

This is velvety, smooth, and creamy. Just yum in my mouth. I could easily drink a handful of these with ease and then pray i didn't pay for the alcohol content after. Sometimes expectations are hard to meet, but in this case it surpassed any thoughts i had on what this beer would be like. 602 charactersKelp, Jan 16, 2010
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Strange. This Peche Mortel has an American-style screw-top bottle. I thought screw-tops and craft beer don't go together... maybe in Canada. 
Opaque black, with a dense, tan head. Pretty ominous. 
Heaps of roasted malt and dark, oily coffee in the aroma. Nice for coffee lovers like me.
The flavor is very good, with tons of rich, earthy coffee. Fantastically bitter as well. However, these are the only two notes I'm getting, and two notes don't make a complex chord for my taste buds, at least when I'm drinking an imperial. Mouthfeel is good; very creamy but not as luscious as some big, bad stouts. 
This is an excellent beer, and I'm definitely a coffee guy-- grind them whole beans and brew a mean pot to get me going almost every morning. Yet, when I drink an imperial stout I don't really want to be drinking coffee, coffee, COFFEE. Maybe I'll have Peche Mortel for breakfast sometime. 897 charactersdasenebler, Jan 13, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Alright, time to see just how good the #1 Canadian beer is.
Appearance: Unsurprisingly black as night, and produced a deep brown finger of head the stuck around for a long time, but did not really lace all the much.
Smell: An espresso smell is putting it mildly as rich waves of coffee aroma are coming off of this wit with hints of vanilla and light chocolate. Very nice scent and potency, but I would have also liked a bit of malt.
Taste: Wow, this is a very well balanced beer as it seems to come in waves of well balanced coffee nuances. Starts with a bit of malt and turns to a balanced chocolate. However every part of this beer brings rich coffee beans to the table. I want to give it a 4.75 as some more beer elements could be present. However, given it is clearly labeled a coffee beer, I'm willing to let it slide.
Mouthfeel: Beautiful transitioning, excellent carbonation however probably it's weakest quality is the very bitter, almost earthy aftertaste that is a bit too pungent. However it does not linger which is a plus.
Drinkability: The only thing that stops this beer from going down is the aftertaste, and the fact there are times, when you simply don't feel like having coffee. Smooth going down and a strong coffee presence that will wake you up. 
Final Thoughts: Well played BDC, well played. I do not think I will experience a coffee beer that is quite this good again. This beer is so good, I'm pretty sure I won't be able to drink another Mill St Coffee Porter ever again. It's deserving of it's spot as the #1 Canadian beer that is for certain. 1,577 charactersTheHammer, Jan 13, 2010

3.65/5  rDev -17%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5This is the closest thing I've ever tasted to coffee beer. If you like deep dark roasted coffee, this is your beer. Unfortunately, I'm not a coffee drinker so this is just not an enjoyable experience. I'm the absolute wrong person to be reviewing this beer with any level of objectivity. The beer is inky black with a nice creamy tan head, decent retention and lacing. The nose is deep roasted malts, some charred notes, slight but not overpowering coffee flavors, some pungent sweet malts backed up with some ABV is also quite prevalent.
The taste is a real zinger for me. The deep coffee and mocha flavors are just over the top. This has the flavor of strong ground coffee grinds, ABV, and just wild expresso. We sometimes refer to stouts as having some coffee like flavors, but in comparison to this beer, most of the porters and stouts that claim the coffee mantle are just pale imitators. This is the reigning champ of coffee beers if there ever was such a thing. The beer is quite creamy and smooth as well. I wish I were a coffee drinker and perhaps I would have enjoyed this beer, but alas no. The appreciation factor is just not there. 1,145 charactersalbern, Jan 10, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've heard a lot about this beer so i decided to pick up a bottle from Capone's. With the temperature below freezing and snow in the forecast i couldn't think of a better beer to drink. I hope it doesn't disappoint.
APPEARENCE: Poured into a tulip glass. This beer is about as black as they come. Absolutely zero light is coming through this badboy. The head is a roasted hazelnut color. An aggressive pour produced over a three finger head that looks soft and creamy and thick enough to float the bottlecap on. As it slowly fades, it blankets the glass with a creamy trail of suds.
SMELL: Can you say coffee! This baby smells like you're in a brewhouse. Chocolate and a smidgen of alcohol.
TASTE: This is a tasty beer. There's two flavors that dominate. Coffee and chocolate both compliment each other and the balance in tremendous.
MOUTHFEEL: One word describes the mouthfeel of this...PERFECT! Wow! Pillowy, soft, rich creamy, smooth. I've never had a beer that goes down so easily and smooth.
DRINKABILITY: Coffee, chocolate, perfect mouthfeel. Theres not too much worng with this beer. (besides limited availability and a huge price tag). I could definitely drink another or two of these. If you can find this beer i recommend picking it up. What a treat. 1,265 charactersBigMike, Jan 08, 2010

4.57/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to TheHammer for this one. This marks my first beer of the new year as well as the last of my christmas break and a late birthday present to myself. 
Bottle to snifter, served at cellar temp.
Pours a thick and oily opaque black with a 1 finger deep tan head that quickly recedes leaving dots of lace.
The nose is big and potent with strong notes of coffee, dark chocolate, alcohol, sticky dark fruits, molasses, and hints of caramel. 
The sweetness of the dark chocolate, dark fruits, caramel, and molasses are all still there but are lessened by the strong presence of fresh espresso which leads to a bitter and dry finish.
Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth, rich, and oily; coating the palate. The balance is superb with the sweet notes being strong but not cloying and the espresso presence being very pronounced but not too bitter with everything tying together to create an excellent, perfectly balanced stout. This one's a sipper for sure, but the drinkability is scary with the high ABV very well hidden and the mouthfeel being velvety smooth.
An exceptional stout to say the least. Big flavours, perfect balance, excellent mouthfeel, and a ridiculous drinkability. DDC is a world class brewery and this beer proves it. 1,242 charactersludachris, Jan 04, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours black as sin (appropriate) with very small chocolate highlights. Smallish Sandy head that fades somewhat rapidly, although considering the ABV, that's not surprising. Big coffee and espresso notes on the nose, followed by a bit of booze and dark fruit. Roasted and smokey notes are there too. 
Taste is extremely robust. 
Big coffee, slight alcohol, some chocolate, hint of citrus, slight bitter kick, a blend of roasted and pale malt flavors, some woody/earthen notes, and a nice warming finish with a bit of alcohol, coffee, and slight hop bitterness. For such an outrageous beer, this one is wonderfully balanced. Extraordinary body on this one, just very full and coating, without being syrupy and sticky. Creamy and velvety. Tremendous. Drinkability is great, especially considering the ABV. I could slug this down, though I want it to last for quite a while. I guess the closest thing I could liken this brew to is an amped up Founders Breakfast Stout. The finesse in this brew, however, is far superior to FBS (in spite of FBS's greatness). Definitely one of my favorite stouts, especially in the non-BA category. 1,128 charactersLordAdmNelson, Jan 03, 2010
2.8/5  rDev -36.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 2 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2Glassware - Over-sized brandy snifter.
Appearance - Pours a very dark black with some very dark red highlights. There isn't too much of a head to speak of, even after a very vigorous pour. There are some bubbles however, they are floating around the outside of the glass and are scattered through the top of the beer. Rolling the beer around the glass shows off some very nice legs and leaves some really nice lacing.
Nose - I could smell this beer across the room while setting up the pictures, it is strong. Lots of roasted barley notes, alcohol and really dark coffee. Very dark, strong coffee. This is a coffee stout for sure and a hard one to contend with in the nose.
Taste - Astringent bitterness coming from the coffee flavor with a strong, burnt coffee aftertaste. Very bitter and very aggressive. I think it's actually a bit too much for me. The alcohol, the malt, any semblance of flavor is completely annihilated by this burnt coffee flavor. This one is clearly not for me.
Mouthfeel - The body is on the heavier side of medium (or the lighter side of heavy... whichever) with really nice carbonation. The beer finishes a little sticky which I normally wouldn't mind but the flavor of this stickiness is burnt coffee.
Overall - This beer has a lot of potential, maybe this was a bad batch but I really could see myself enjoying this if it were more than one dimensional bitterness. 1,398 charactersmullenite, Jan 03, 2010

4.08/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours black with a thick brown head that thins to a mere surface covering. Aroma consists of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, molasses with some peat also. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and smooth. The initial taste has a dark roasted malt flavor with heavy vinous notes. What follows combines flavors of burnt malt, dark roasted coffee and molasses. The finish has an interesting smokiness to it. There's also a slight red berry or dark wineskin taste that emerges toward the back also. 
A complex sipper would be an understatement. This imperial stout has a lot going on in it's flavor profile. A little less coffee flavor than I was expecting. Still a great RIS to try despite the price. 689 charactersWinter, Jan 03, 2010
2.85/5  rDev -35.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2Pours black with a thin brown head that fades rapidly, eventually disappearing entirely. No or minimal lacing. Aroma is sweet and malty, with coffee and chocolate...and smoky. Good enough. But then comes the taste - and that's where something went wrong. I don't know if it was my bottle or my palate, but the predominant taste at play was smoke. Just plain smoke. Maybe it could also be interpreted as charred or burnt. Either way, it was overwhelming. Behind that, there were notes of coffee and chocolate and maybe prunces, but compared to the burnt smokiness, they were downright subtle. Smokiest RIS I've ever had. It made it almost completely unpalatable. I'll have to try it again to see if there was some weird factor at play here, but I did not enjoy the taste. 
It was like drinking burnt wood and charcoal in a burning house. Completely overpowering and smothering every other taste. 895 charactersMavajo, Jan 02, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Dark hazelnut brown to black in color with almost no head, just a halo of khaki colored foam that leaves little lacing. Gives off a roasted coffee smell, toffee, vanilla, chocolate, and hints of dark fruits (prune, raisin). There is some smoke in the nose as well with some woody earthy olive notes. It was a delicious first sip, with deep chocolate and coffee flavors that are beautifully subtle. Smooth roasty flavors of coffee merge into a dark chocolate finish with a comforting warm alcohol finish that lingers. The flavor plays well with a rolling sweet throughout going from roasty to bitter coffee to sweet booming once more. This is a very good beer. It is rich and complex, subtle yet very bold when all the aspects of alcohol, coffee and chocolate combine in a delicious harmony. It has a slick mouthfeel, chewy, full bodied and leaves a stick on the mouth with residual warmth relative to a barrel aged beer. 920 charactersLldeegan, Jan 01, 2010

Pours black with a dark tan head. Aroma is strong black coffee with some roasted malt. Flavor is similar with a lot of coffee and some bitterness. Also get some dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium-thick and very creamy. This one lived up to the hype. 328 charactersMora2000, Jan 01, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Served from a 11.5oz. bottle purchased at The Wine Source in Baltimore, MD into my Darkness snifter (graciously picked up at Surly by kbutler1, thanks man!) at the appropriate temperature (12/29/09).
A: Pours a deep oily black with just slight mahogany edges when held up to the light. A small cap of a cappuccino foam dissolves quickly to almost a haze leaving no lace whatsoever.
S: Excellent bouquet of fresh espresso and dark chocolate along with a roasted malt. Some tinges of milk chocolate and cocoa are present as well. 
T: Exceptional flavor containing notes of fresh coffee, espresso, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, chocolate malt, and some brown sugar. There is a slight bitterness and sweetness that help to add complexity and balance.
M:Very full-bodied with smooth and creamy carbonation. Perfect for the style and extremely rich yet well-balanced.
D: Incredibly drinkable as the flavors are well balanced and rich. The 9.5% abv. is hidden expertly never showing itself at in the slightest.
Overall this was a truly a wonderful Imperial Stout that certainly lives up to the hype. If only this were not $5-6 per 11.5oz. bottle, I would drink this quite often. Thanks again Kevin for the Darkness glass that is so well suited to Imperial Stouts. Highly Recommended. 1,305 charactersLunch, Dec 30, 2009
4.58/5  rDev +4.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 411.5 oz bottle poured into a Nonic. 9.5% ABV, "Bottle Conditioned" Space for notched numbers on the label (two sets of 0-10) but the only thing notched was the first 0.
A - Peche Mortel is clear on the pour but completely black in the nonic. A large, three-finger head rises from the depths inducing a beautiful trickle of cascading beer. The result is a dark tan head with great retention and thick, patchy lace on the glass.
S - This is one of the most intensely roasted malt noses I've ever smelled. Black patent and chocolate malts give it a dark, brooding bitter and dry scent with lots of dark coffee bean to boot. A hint of brown sugar and molasses deepens the aroma.
T - The dark roasted malts are even more sinfully dark, robust, and bitter than the nose lets on. The hint of brown sugar and molasses are still there but are nearly lost amidst the chocolate and black patent roasted maltiness. The coffee, which tastes more like espresso, is equally as robust adding a dark bitterness to the brew that balances almost perfectly with the initial overly booziness. A very nice tasting imperial coffee stout.
M - Full-bodied and robust with a moderate carbonation level, the real complexity of this beer's mouthfeel is in the dryness. At points the coffee and robust malts can be almost chalk-like or cocoa powder-like in texture. The finish is bitter. Just a bit too much of a good thing here?
D - A nice imperial coffee stout I'd love to enjoy more (if it were a bit lower in price) but proves to be a slow sipper. Nicely done. If you spy this one, pick one up but make sure you like coffee. 1,604 charactersBeerFMAndy, Dec 29, 2009

Pours beautifully. Dark dark walnut brown with a big firm dense head. The head slowly dissipates to a heavy film and on the way looks deliciously like an ice cream float. Curtainy or spotty lace along the way. A very appetizing look to this beer.
Smells like a coffee liqueur. Coffee, chocolate and malt. Very rich and sweet smelling with the high alcohol content very nicely managed. Mm-mmm.
Sweet and syrupy, medium mouthfeel. Lots of coffee, chocolate and toastiness. Bitter lingering finish, but without the drying chalkiness that you get with many porters. Borders on being a barley wine in character, but does a much better job of handling the high alcohol content and takes away any boozy harshness.
Not for quick drinking. Suitable for lingering over and savouring. A stern, but well made and enjoyable beer. 888 charactersTerryW, Dec 29, 2009
4.03/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I've had this in the closet for six to eight months probably.
Dark, dark brown with a light tan two-finger head with a vigorous pour. 
A roasty coffee aroma dominates enough to mask anything else that might be there. 
The taste is mildly bitter and super roasty. No burnt coffee taste here at all. Just nice and roasty. I'm surprised the coffee flavor has held up so well after half a year or so sitting. I've had other coffee stouts that were amazing fresh but really degraded to super bitter after just a few months (aces and ates in particular). So, pleasant surprise. 
Mouthfeel is slightly acidic, most evident on the back of the throat. It's pretty creamy for the most part, but two sips seemed pretty thin, perhaps as the head fell and carbonation was lower, not completely sure... I think the carbonation is really aiding the creaminess. 
Drinkability is pretty high, alcohol is practically absent. If there was more going on than the huge coffee profile, I'd find it to be more drinkable. A quality beer but one is plenty for me. 1,043 charactersCrittervision, Dec 28, 2009
4.26/5  rDev -3.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served into a tulip slightly chilled from a 12 oz bottle, it pours a dirty motor oil black with hints of ruby tones. A 2-finger-thick chocolate colored head forms at the top. I wait about 5 minutes to actually take a sip, and I notice the head has not changed one bit! 
Aroma is of roasty, bitter chocolate and coffee. Burnt coffee is the best way I can describe it. Some butterscotch also comes through on my nose a bit as well. not terribly complex but very pleasing.
Expecting a bit of sweet coffee (caramel mixed with coffee) but this is not what I expected. A big hit of roasted malts and coffee hit my palate very hard. It gives way to a sweetening on the finish. Not as dry on the finish as expected, and not boozy at all for 9.5%.
Feel is very nice. Roasty and dry up front, but a nice chewy cold-season brew. 
Awesome brew to drink. I wish I had a 22 oz. It'd make a nice brew to have a few to warm you up on a cold winter's eve. 942 charactersFish113d, Dec 28, 2009

Significant bitterness from the roasted malt and coffee. Maybe a touch of hops in the finish. A bit one dimensional but actually the coffee flavor has a lot of complexities.

Had this recently at a stout tasting, and while this is still a great beer it's a little one-note on the coffee for me. If you want espresso in beer form this is your best bet, but having it next to Founders Breakfast Stout and Beer Geek Breakfast, I seemed to prefer when the coffee is part of a bigger picture. 4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.75
*original review - 4.5/5/5/4.5/4*
I've been waiting a while to try this. I was going to go to Julio's to pick it up, but I surprisingly found it at Table & Vine a few days ago, so that saved me a trip. I drank it while eating eggs, bacon, and rye toast with apple butter, and it fit pretty well. Pours black with a decent tan head that leaves lacing all the way down. Smells of bitter coffee. Taste is quite amazing, big coffee taste obviously, a little bit of chocolate and vanilla. Alcohol is pretty much undetectable, the intense flavors cover it up very well. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and more or less perfect. Founders Breakfast Stout blew my mind when I first had it, this is very similar so it didn't have the same effect. It's a tad pricey but I will be buying this again in the future. Excellent. 1,159 charactersChico1985, Dec 24, 2009
3.98/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Good coffee stout but overrated. Nice head with very tiny bubbles like a thick mousse or whipped cream. The nose is bitter roasted coffee beans and ethanol. More espresso shows up in the taste with some roasted malt character and burnt dark chocolate. Not as complex as I'd hoped and the mouthfeel is that of a nitro can. The feel was medium thick, but thin on flavor and low on bubbles. Almost like it was sitting out open for a few hours. The mouthfeel is subdued; if the bubbles were sharper the beer would be better. 520 charactersnatelocc787, Dec 23, 2009
4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Thanks to a great trade with clockwerk, I have the opportunity to enjoy this incredible Stout.
Pours a burnt-brown to a light black while making its way into the glass. This quickly recedes to a pitch black liquid with no highlights when held to light, when the glass is filled. A frothy dark beige head sits atop the brew that gives way to decent lacing.
I love gourmet coffee and that is what is prominent in the nose. In the background is roasted caramel malt and not much more that I detect.
The taste is phenomenal, like a coffee pie with graham cracker crust. Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel has done an outstanding job in blending the coffee with this brew to make it not too much and just enough to not go overboard. I detect a tad of alcohol and a bit of hop bite, just enough to compliment the brew wonderfully.
The mouthfeel is thin for me. I am used to the RIS style, so don't put too much merit on how I judge the mouthfeel. I will say it is a smooth finish that leaves me wanting another gulp! I was warned to let this one warm, but I don't want to! Which brings us to drinkability.
Considering the powerful (coffee) stout this is, I am shocked at how well it drinks! I don't care what others have said, I could drink all four of these tonight with ease! 1,264 charactersJosephLondon, Dec 23, 2009

3.92/5  rDev -10.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Served from a 12oz bottle in a snifter at cellar temperature.
While there are dating numbers on the label, there is no notching at all. Oh, come on! Why bother with printing it if you're not going to notch it? Regardless, I've been sitting on this bottle for about a year, so it's at least that old.
A - Even with a soft pour, a deep cocoa-colored head erupts into a velvety soft blanket, eventually subsiding to a microbubbled mat that retreats to the rim. The beer itself is deep and dark, with crimson hues visible during the pour. Lacing is sparse and uneven.
S - BAM! Coffee -- not quite as refined a scent as an espresso... more like some super home-brewed high-octane java... the kind where you ignore the one tablespoon per cup suggestion and push it to two. An organic, semi-woody note is also apparent; sort of like chicory. Also, dark bittersweet chocolate. Coffee grounds.
T - Dark, heavily roasted malts with an unmistakable, oily coffee presence. Some sweetness is definitely present, but in very restrained fashion. A boozy alcohol kick is present in the middle, but it's like getting kicked with a fuzzy slipper rather than a combat boot. Very dry in the finish, leaving a chalky tongue feel, an unsweetened cocoa aftertaste and a warm belly.
M - Vibrant and active on the way in, puffing up in a way that at first seemed too aggressive. Big tingly bubbles quickly tame themselves and become softer and creamier, amazingly avoiding what could have been a very gassy swallow. Throat coating and massive.
D - A definite evening sipper, there is no mistaking that this beer is the product of lots of brewing time and effort. To me, it's a bit one-dimensional and could definitely stand a touch more depth. Still, it's a standout in its class, but definitely NOT to be compared to bourbon barrel-aged versions of the style. 1,841 charactersEPseja, Dec 19, 2009

S - Roasty and delicious, sweet and hot coffee dominates.
T - Yep, definitely a coffee stout maybe too harshly so. Not too hot for 10% ABV, its well hidden behind the sweetness which is almost a bit cloying. 
M - a little over-carbonated, which causes a bit of an acrid bite.
D - Not something I'd go to regularly, but good nonetheless. Light for the style. 523 charactersNYCWheatFanSC, Dec 16, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours pitch black, unable to see through even the edges when held up to the light. Light coating of light brown foam, which dips under after a brief period. Head easily roused with a swirl.
Huge on the coffee, with great dark chocolate and roasted smells backing it up strong. Intense, yet smoother around the edges than many coffee stouts I have had. 
As the smell had me suspecting--Coffee bomb! Enormous coffee flavour. Tastes as if a very large helping of cold pressed coffee was added, with every last drop of the oil from the beans scraped off and mixed in. Nice roasty/dark chocolate backing as in the smell, but the coffee definitely runs the show here. I'd be interested to see how they infused it, as the coffee is so powerful, yet remarkably smooth. Alcohol comes out a bit as it warms, mingling in back with the roasty and chocolatey tastes--all of which are submissive to the caffeinated black poison. 
Medium carbonation, keeps things zipping along. Slightly syrupy (or in this case--oily). 
Even though I couldn't take much more than 1 bottle of this coffee punch, I'm not going to dock it for the intensity of flavours. 
Is the coffee excessive? Some may say so...I think it's damn tasty! Coffee lovers will rejoice for this fine brew. I'd like to try this sometime in the future side-by-side with FBS to compare the coffee character. 1,355 charactersdarklordlager, Dec 15, 2009

The taste is intensive with lots of roasted notes, both of black coffee/espresso and black malt. There are some quickly passing notes of almond cookies and cocoa. Sweet hints of cookies and roasted sugar. The aftertaste got some warming alcohol, an elegant crisp bitterness, notes of espresso and bitter herbs. The flavours are very well kept together. 
The carbonation is mild with few small bubbles. The liquid is thick, sticky and very creamy.

Smell is coffee, lots of slightly sweet coffe backed up with a robust promising maltiness with the obvious roasted notes, as well as a little hint of smokiness, really nice. 
This one tasted magnificient, I had my bottle to a dessert of home made mango-ice cream with a tart sauce of passion fruit and strawberries, a very good match. Taste is full of coffe, not too hard roasted and not too whimsy, just the right amount, don't think I have ever had a beer with this perfectly measured amount of coffee in it, you can really feel how it in every way complement this otherwise extremely balanced beer, roasted malts are abundant, with a slight sweetness to them weighed up by their innate bitterness in the end. I sense a bit of the same smokiness in the taste as I did in the nose, wich fits right into this marvelous mix.
The mouth feel is also just right, the small and creamy bubbles makes the carbonation seem perfect for this kind of beverage and it foams up quite nicely with a swirl or two on the toungue. 1,141 charactersdqrull, Dec 12, 2009

The aroma is one hundred percent pure coffee. If you heated this up and served it as such no one would know. It's all coffee all day. Maybe a hint of chocolate fudge and a hint of booze.
The flavor is spot on roast coffee. Smoked malt and hints of chocolate. The booze is very present with every sip. Warming seems to really bring out the smokiness. 
Full body with no carbonation.

3.67/5  rDev -16.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3$5.49 for a 11.5 fl oz bottle. 9.5% ABV, bottle conditioned. Pours out to a very dark mahogany, near black, forming a small dark tan head, like espresso crema, with good retention and solid sheets of lace. Carbonation is mild to moderate. The aroma is rich with coffee, vanilla, molasses, prunes, black walnut and bourbon. The mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth with a dense, rich and thick body. The taste is a recap of the aroma, but not as pleasant. The coffee is acidic and tart and the bitterness is moderate, accentuated by the earthy coffee. In the finish, there is a hint of oxidation and a ruddy mouthfeel lingering in the aftertaste. Again, the acidity of the hops and the coffee is pretty pronounced and seriously hinders it's drinkability. It's not as smooth and drinkable, as say, Founders Breakfast Stout or KBS. I think it's quite a challenge to find a good mix between the stout and the coffee when brewing a beer in this style, and I don't think this one does a very good job. The mouthfeel is always a challenge, and I think the way the coffee is used is particularly important. My limited experience suggests that brewing espresso and adding it after fermentation is the way to go, as opposed to brewing with drip coffee or steeping during the mash. At any rate, as it warms, the sweetness of the malts comes out and helps to balance the acidity of the coffee. I would actually recommend drinking this one at about 55-60F to get the best mix of flavors
8 years ago, this beer was notorious, and I'm glad I tried it, but there are much better beers of this style out there now. 1,595 charactersMitchster, Dec 09, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5It slowly extricates itself into a languid pour that finally fills the snifter halfway with an incredibly thick, opaque, burnt-brown elixir of stupefying viscosity. A semi-determined head of brownish beige initially appears, but quickly diminishes to a thin skim, and finally to small floating amoebae of foam.
It is a full bodied smell, insinuative and aromatic, carrying dank essences of bitter espresso, bitter chocolate, burnt and roasted notes, almost a subtle burnt toffee in there (I'm imagining it to describe the under scent). As it warms, the scents of dark fruit (ripe plum, cherry) appear behind the scenes. It isn't as complex a smell as others of this style, but what it has is clean, balanced, deep, and tempting.
What you get in the nose you get in the mouth. This oft used expression finds ultimate meaning with this stout. Bitter espresso greets your tongue in an opening fusillade of flavor that quickly escalates to the bitter chocolate, burnt notes, that sweet but burnt and roasty flavor, not toffee in the taste, but a deeply caramel dankness that is almost sweet,not quite sweet, and the finish is full of fruity plum and cherry, ending in a long, clean, half-juicy (if you can believe it), half dry in a deliciously clinging way. Magnificent. As the nose, the flavors are intense, balanced, clean, and tempting----squared. No wonder this is a top 100. This is f***g delicious.
You would think a beer this thick would have trouble with mouthfeel. Isn't that where huge beers can go wrong? Not here, somehow this 10w40 drinks light, and the finish is free of cloying characteristics. The finish is staggeringly good. This beer is art.
Drinkability. This beer is a sipper to the full meaning of the word. It is big, and full of dank flavor, and the alcohol is very, very well hidden. This beer is as drinkable as a big stout can get imho. 1,864 characterscavedave, Dec 08, 2009

D: One of the better imperial stouts I've had. The likeness to coffee/espresso is really impressive. I guess that's what you get when you brew with fair trade coffee beans. I think I would have liked this even more if there were some other flavors to balance out the coffee and make it more complex. That being said, however, this really is a world class RIS.

Taste - It tasted like a straight cup of espresso. Extremely enjoyable flavor. Had a sweetness to it. Perhaps a hint of dark fruit as well.
Mouthfeel - Nice carbonation. It was pretty thick and full bodied.
Drinkability - Smooth and delicious, as expected. This is by and large the best stout I have ever had. 460 charactersmfabian12, Dec 07, 2009
4.22/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured from an 11.5 oz bottle into a goblet.
A - Pours a silky, heavy, pitch black with a half-inch of chocolate brown foam on top, leaving intermittent spots of lacing.
S - Lots of roasted malt and coffee with a slight indecipherable twang, possibly some sourness from the coffee.
T - Roasty, bitter coffee, toasted malt, bitter chocolate, with a hint of sweet toffee in the aftertaste. Very dark and complex. Bitterness is very manageable.
M - Oily, heavy, silky, with a little bit of pep in the carbonation. Like liquid velvet.
D - Even if you had the stones to down this and not be impaired by its hefty ABV, you'd be disrespecting this one if you drink too quickly. Sip and Savor this deep, dark, vicious brew.
Overall - If this beer is a sin, then kick my ass to hell, because this one rocks. It doesn't have the same heady, luscious vanilla of KBS, but makes up for it with its amazing roasty coffee character. 923 charactersDannyS, Dec 06, 2009

Pours an extremely dark brown color body, with a small tan brown head, diminishing. Strong aroma of coffee, espresso. All I get is the coffee. Very carbonated, strong coffee taste, biting. Might be the alcohol. Alcoholy aftertaste for sure. Roasted taste. A little too strong coffee and not much else for my liking. 345 charactersjujubeast6000, Dec 05, 2009

Wow, what a taste. The coffee lingers for weeks. Chocolate, raisins, fig, earthy and bitter.

A - engine oil black pour, with a finger plus of dark brown head
S - an abundance of rich coffee aromas assail the nosem some chocolate compliments all that coffee creating a rich mocha aroma, heavy on the coffee component
T - the rich coffee permeates through to the taste as i would expect, with more emphasis on the coffee bean itself, also some mellowing and welcome lactic sweetness
M&D - despite being monotypic, this is a supreme beer, rich and flavorful, mellowed and smoothed from the lactose sweetness, it almost nears a milk stout to me, hides a near double digit ABV very well. this would be a beer cellar staple if they distributed in CT 691 characterssinstaineddemon, Dec 03, 2009

4.13/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Pours an expected thick murky black color with a deep brown head. Not a ton of carbonation, but more than many similar beers.
The primary flavors are coffee, baker's chocolate, and dried fruits like raisins and prunes. I like that there are some sweet flavors in there to keep it from being all roast and nothing else. While it's simplistic on paper, the flavors mesh very well and this is an extremely tasty beer.
Texture is silky smooth and it doesn't feel nearly as strong as it actually is. 
Not the absolute best coffee imperial stout, but definitely one of them.
I bought a 12oz bottle for only $5-6, which is a pretty good deal for something this good. It doesn't' affect my rating, but is worth mentioning. 714 charactersDomingo, Nov 29, 2009
3.06/5  rDev -30.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 2.5Maybe the darkest of any of those enjoyed recently - absolutely no ruby or brown shows through the bottom of the pint. Tan head pocked by bubble bursts caps the top. 
The nose is like coffee liquer - no lack of strength or alcohol here. 
Deep coffee flavors dominate, leaving little room for anythin else, though a bit of dark chocolate is apparent. Unfortunately, heavy alcohol also comes through with the coffee and really detracts from the overall enjoyment here. 
The mouthfeel is great, with restrained carbonation and smooth delivery. 
While the majority feel this is a great beer, the alcohol is too heavy to enjoy the entire package. 645 charactersmdcrouser, Nov 28, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4When opening the bottle I was surprised to see that the bottle was a twist off. After prying off the twist off, I put my nose at the top of the bottles and took in a nice big whiff. What returned was a wonderful mixture of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts. There is a huge bitter chocolate/dark chocolate nose on this. This would go superbly with double chocolate cake or something similar. The beer is poured almost pitch black, but there is a slight ruby tint. A fluffy tan head rests upon the top of the beer. The nose after pouring the beer is slightly different: there is a bit more of sweetness to the chocolate notes.
Taking a sip of this beer gives huge chocolate flavours with a nice balance from coffee. There is a slight bit of alcohol coming through as well. At the end of the beer there is a nice bitter coffee flavour to round out the beer. The body is much more thin than I expected, but it's still tasty. I like my imperial stouts to be incredibly thick. I think there is a bit too much carbonation as well. The flavours are well rounded in the beer, but I want much more bold flavours. 
The more the beer warms up the better the beer tastes. I just wish there was a bit more body or less carbonation. 1,223 charactersswizzlenuts, Nov 26, 2009

It looks like Norwegian Metal in a glass. With a great tan head so fluffy you wanna lay your head on it and take a nap (which you might have to do after drinkin it).
It smells like a balanced breakfast of coffee, raisin bread, and bourbon.
The coffee is the prodominant flavor in this very complex beer. Sweet, bitter, roasty with fig, and plum and yes some booze.
It's like beelzebub's load in your mouth. Nuf' said.
This beer turns it up to 11, see. It's worth all the trouble it might get you into. 542 charactersdeathdealer666, Nov 21, 2009

Smell is overwhelmingly good, strong coffee, plum, raisin, burnt malt. Surprisingly sweet aroma which I normally do not find in a coffee Imperial Stout. 
Taste - Over the top coffee, I am having this for breakfast as I had heard it made a good coffee replacement. Espresso, milky roasted malt, nice bitter bite from the coffee, sweet plum flavor, raisin / fig and slightly astringent finish I am guessing from the coffee. 
Mouthfeel is a medium to thick body
Drinkability is amazing. If I had a few of these it would be hard to abstain. 639 charactersalpinebryant, Nov 21, 2009

Its advocates certainly weren't lying, wow what an amazing beer!
The elixir pours a pitch black, with the viscosity of oil. A light brown head mounted the caliginous brew keeping throughout the session.
The scent of coffee is the first thing that hit my nose accompanied by notes of roast malt and caramel. Candied apples and sour fruit mixed with hints of rum soaked cherries. Toffee and marshmallow were companions to the smell of roasted peanuts. The bouquet was extremely elaborate, scents mingling to and fro.
My first sip brought me to breakfast with a feeling of coffee and cream in the mouth as well as in taste. Roasted malt flavours mixed well with the coffee tones providing good balance. Fudge and peanut butter, dark chocolate, and nutmeg all popped up most reminiscent of Resse's peanut butter cups. The strong alcohol percentage were present but in the form of plum brandy and fermented dates. Star anise gave slight licorice taste which added to the overall richness and complimented the alcohol well. Hop presence was minimal providing balance and giving a slightly dry finish which petered out to the taste of coffee.
This beer is like drinking velvet one of the best stouts I've ever had and truly a supreme example of a well crafted extreme stout. 1,409 charactersReinheitsgebot71, Nov 16, 2009

Let me tell you,if you haven't made it to this event GO, it is one of the best. IMO. Now, back to the beer. All I had was a 5oz. tasting glass serving, but when I drank it, all I could say was WOW. One of the best I've ever tasted. But to make a honest evaluation, I would have to see if it was available back in my home state of New Jersey.
Luckily for me a friend of mine owns a pub/liquor store and it was available. Get me a case. When it came in, I chilled a few bottles for a couple a days. I poured it into a goblet. dark black,tan foamy head. Coffee and more coffee maybe toffee. Very full bodied, nice and creamy. Lacing down the sides. A great beer to sip on a cool night.
Yes it lives up to the hype. For me the best coffee stout I have ever drank. 887 charactersInspectorBob, Nov 15, 2009

The head only stands about a half inch from the initial pour. As it recedes it is unable to maintain lacing. Color is a silky dark brown that shifts to black. Thin blood red highlights appear when holding the glass to the light.
Smell has lots of dark chocolate, espresso beans, and a little dark cherry. Taste is also a bold rush of dark chocolate. The kind with chunks of cocoa beans in it. Taste is a little like a red chocolate cake. Coffee is warm and nutty, pecans and hazelnut. Mellow snap from the alcohol in the finish.
Mouthfeel has a thick velvety texture. Chewy body that paints itself across the tongue. This is a great sipper, and I'm really excited that it is now locally available. 786 charactersbort11, Nov 14, 2009
4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoying this as a breakfast beer, poured from an 11.5oz bottle into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. Took the bottle out of the fridge about half an hour before opening it to take the chill off. Bottled in '08 (date code is difficult for me to decipher otherwise).
Liquid is a glassy opaque seal brown with a slender buff color head with decent retention (agitation makes the head kick up again easily, and the color seems to grow darker each time you do this, until it equalizes out at a darkish-tan). Thick legs lick the glass and lacing creates unusual patterns akin to a native SouthWestern textile.
Black french-press, dark roast, freshly brewed coffee on the nose. Succulent roast malt and vanilla cream notes emerge with time once I've acclimated to the coffee.
An almost smoky coffee flavor on the palate is joined by dark chocolate, molasses, and licorice. Some suggestion of black bread and black pepper phenols as well. Sweetness is expertly reigned in by a pleasant bitterness (coming more from coffee than hops, or roasted malt astringency), leading into a dry finish with notes of cherry and mint from the alcohol and hints of figs and prunes in the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel is delectable, with a fairly heavy body, creamy with good carbonation and just a little astringency to balance the dessert-like nature of the beer. 
ABV is perfectly integrated adding as much body and flavor as possible without being overbearing which makes this dangerously drinkable. 
Without a doubt the best coffee stout I've tried (haven't had Founders yet though) - and one of the better stouts in general. 1,607 charactersaugustgarage, Nov 13, 2009

Aroma of coffee, caramel, burnt brown sugar, and very sweet toffee.
Flavor matches the aroma. Very sweet up front with a nice roasted bittersweet coffee flavor finishing it off. I'm not a huge coffee fanatic so I can't describe the complexities of the coffee.
Very full bodied and very thick. Coats the tongue between drinks.
Damn good drinkability. Good flavor but I doubt I could have more than one - kind of strong and might get a little too sweet after a while. 644 charactersdavexisxrabid, Nov 12, 2009

The sinful infusion pours an opaque ebony with a coffee-coloured head that settled to a thin covering quickly. It says "drink me!"
Aroma--wait! Did they steal the aroma from Yukon Brewing's Midnight Sun Espresso Stout??? (http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/4701/17085)
Honestly, this is an almost identical aroma profile, from the very first whiff. Which means it's a great smelling beer, but midnight sun doesn't get half the hype this beer does, and so far: Midnight Sun is a better looking, similar smelling brew.
The flavour profile confirms what is actually quite shocking to me. Midnight Sun, brewed by Canada's farthest north brewery, has this Peche Mortel bested. This still means this beer is great--just not what I expected. Obvious huge hits of espresso here; coffee flavours dominating. Some chocolate raisins, dusty prunes, with a huge dry finish. The finish also has some sweeter characteristics and faint phenols.
I expected more body from this, but it's actually quite light. They've masked the 9.5 abv nicely, as the beer is dangerously quaffable. This definitely did not fulfill the hype, for me personally. And I simply can't believe that, what with all the hype, Yukon Brewing in Whitehorse is doing this BETTER, and is painfully under-appreciated. 
(*I didn't mean to review this beer constantly referring to another beer, but truthfully this beer was EXTREMELY similar to Midnight Sun. Which means they are both great beers. But one is criminally underrated. Maybe it's because of the alcohol content...) 1,721 charactersCwrw, Nov 11, 2009
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 412oz. bottle served into a Chimay goblet
Pours a satisfying color that could pass as black. I like 'em dark and this most mortal of sins is dark enough. I don't know why I keep insisting on drinking impy stouts out of this Chimay goblet as I never get any sizable head in it, but the richly tan lacing is pretty good all throughout the drinking process.
The coffee aromas are very intense. This is the first time I've had this particular beer so my mind's point of comparison is to on-tap Founders Breakfast Stout. I don't have any idea how young or old this bottle is but the zippy, lemony espresso aromas are present and accounted for. Its typically a great sign in a coffee stout when it smells like espresso or french-pressed Ethiopian beans and not like ground Maxwell House. I can pick up a fair amount of sweetness from alcohol. I hope that doesn't portend a beer with too much alcohol harshness.
The taste paragraph doesn't need much text. Do you like bright espresso flavors? Do you want them to dominate the drink, even on the aftertaste? Do you also want some roasted, bready, "beer" flavor points? How about a gentle kiss of alcohol sweetness and warmth? This beer has exactly those things and nothing else.
The beer is surprisingly thin in body. its probably the thinnest impy stout I've had in a long, long time. Perhaps this is an older bottle that lost some body in the aging process? It isn't a dealbreaker, though. It kind of accentuates the espresso flavors somehow. Its a large beer but keeping in mind that no one is going to have more than one bottle unless their crazy this is pretty darn drinkable. Its full-flavored yet light.
This is a perfect beer for when those Autumn nights start to get chilly. Its not viscous enough for a winter stout but its certainly warming enough. If you enjoy coffee stouts then you can't pass up Peche Mortel -- the coffee flavors are just so well-executed. I'm not convinced that this is better than Founders Breakfast Stout, but it is certainly in the discussion. 2,025 charactersReaper16, Nov 11, 2009

This is an outstanding beer that should be savoured. However, I don't think I'd have more than one in a sitting. I'm torn that greatness can have a negative impact on the "drinkability" score. I may not have another right after but I will definitely buy this again. Then 4.5 it gets...
It pours out black as night into the glass with a head that had a reddish tan colour. Not an ounce of light comes through this even when held against a light. The head recedes to a thin layer. Some decent lacing to accompany the drink.
Great aroma off the pour with coffee, cocoa, dark alcoholic fruits and bread. Exceptional.
The first sensation is the smooth mouthfeel. Then the flavour explodes, launched by the power of the higher octane alcohol. This power subsides by the third or forth sip as my tastebuds calibrate to the amplified flavours. Like the smell, the same flavours are there. The finish has a medium-high bitterness that lingers with the alcolol-fruits and coffee. My only critisicm is that it's a bit acidic in the after taste. Otherwise, a great coffee stout. 1,197 charactersecoastman, Nov 07, 2009

The taste is of rich, roasted coffee/espresso. Coffee shows a strong presence, but caramel/toffee mixes in to give it a nice complexity. Nit is well-balanced between sweet and roast with a mild earthy bitterness in the long finish. Alcohol peeks through, but not raw or sharp. 
It has a creamy, velvety body. The finish lingers on the palate.
A wonderful coffee-infused stout. Delicious. Strong all-around, yet drinkable for abv. 621 charactersjwc215, Nov 01, 2009

Ordered 12 of these specially for me from my little local LCBO. $45.50. botted in July 2009.
A: Looks like a dark belgian chocolate. not black but VERY dark brown. nice tan head - fades quickly though with no lacing.
S: alchohol up front with the yeast. coffee middle and chocolate finish. I think I smell chocolate more than the coffee. Its possible my senses are dulled from drinking some strong coffee earlier on. dark cherries in there too. 
T: This is stout perfection. alchohol very well hidden. perfect balance between bitter and sweet. coffee more present on the finish. definite bitter end. chocolate plays a strong backbone throughout. Dark fruits more evident as beer becomes room temp.
M: Thick. chewey. like liquid bread. high carbonation for a stout which really does the beer justice. the bitterness carbonation really play well together
D: I was going to rate drinkability a 4.0 - but then I thought - this is a slow sipping beer and im taking a big sip every 4 seconds. its so delicous it deserves a 5 here too.
This and Founders BS are definitly the best stouts out there in my opinion. 1,154 charactersuno99, Oct 30, 2009

S - Tons of coffee, some darker fruit smell and almost no alcohol.
T - Cha ching. I heard this has too much coffee but I honestly think they did a great job. Almost no taste of alcohol covered up by this coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, sugary beverage. 
M - You know, I really liked Dark Lord because of its slightly high carbonation and this actually had the same. 
D - The 12 oz bottle was the perfect amount. I'd really like to get some more of this and have it around for one of those nights where I feel like treating myself. 572 charactersKCHopHead, Oct 28, 2009

A: Black as motor oil and thick and viscous as it rolls into the glass, a thin creamy mocha head appears that rises to almost one finger. As it sits the head falls to a thin lace on top of the beer and leaves a thin wispy lacing on the glass.
S: Coffee anyone? This smells of rich robust espresso with a hint of molasses and brown sugar. A little cinnamon comes through as well.
T: What a massive flavor, definitely get the espresso coming through in a huge way and it dominates the palate at first, but then gives way to some molasses and brown sugar with a hint of spicy cinnamon. Tastes similar to the way it smells and that is fantastic!
M: The mouth feel is absolutely exceptional! Thick and viscous yet smooth and incredibly creamy. The 9.5% is perfectly integrated into the beer and is nowhere to be found. This is as good as it gets when it comes to mouth feel.
D: For 9.5% this goes down so so so smooth! For an imperial coffee stout this is dangerously drinkable and overall a fantastic beer. This is a world class beer for sure and one to be tried and tried again! 1,101 charactersRedBrewer83, Oct 27, 2009

I remember the ratings but not the exact wording. Had this one in Montreal on tap, it really changed my beer drinking life, got me into craft beer. I used to describe this one as "starbucks" with 9% alcohol. Pours oil black with the most beautiful dark tan head that looks like coffee ice cream. Good lacing and head retention. Smells and tastes of roasted coffee and malts, some chocolate in there too. Its definitely the best coffee beer I have ever experienced thus far. Mouthfeel was a tiny bit watery for me, it was definitely creamier on tap. The carbonation is smooth and no alcohol really comes through. Perfect drinkability, the taste is enough for me to buy this one over and over again. The price tag does not matter when a beer of such quality is contained within the bottle. Amazing DDC. 911 characterscbutova, Oct 26, 2009

(A)- Pours fairly thick and pitch black that produced a good creamed coffee colored head that dissipated quickly but not all-together; is still present even at the end! Is leaving a thin tan film of lacing here and there. 
(S)- Dense and dark ground espresso. Hell, its like they dumped the grounds into the bottle! Seriously rich and dense bits of coffee. Just a touch of cinnamon & molasses bread in the far background; dry. 
(T)- Deep, dense, and rich loads of fantastic well-made espresso with just the right amount of bitterness, sweetness, and roasted characteristics. Bits of that cinnamon/molasses bread carries with it a hint of nuttiness. Layers of cocoa appear here and there. Finishes dry. Excellent both cold and as it warms up a bit. 
(M)- Incredibly silky smooth. The espresso just rolls off the tongue while still lingering meshing with the other nuances creating wonderful complexities that a great cup of true espresso can offer the palate on a brisk fall/winter morning. Where is the 9.5% abv?
(D)- A superb stout that really puts the coffee addition front and center in the profile of the beer. Very much a stout and very much like coffee. This really gets better with age; it smoothes out and becomes a silky beauty that I actually prefer than fresh. Seek this one out if you enjoy coffee. 1,371 characterssweemzander, Oct 26, 2009

A: Jet black, completely inpenetrable to light. Dark tan coloured head which disappears fairly quickly but laces the glass
S: No surprise here...coffee! Also hints of chocolate. The alcohol is more detectable in the nose than in the actual taste
T: Coffee, fading to dark chocolate. Slight alcohol hint at the end, however not unpleasant in the least. 
M: Rich, thick...like liquid velvet.
D: Any mystique aside, this is one of the best beers I've tried in my life. Yes, I had to actively hunt it down, but this in no way skews my rating...I wouldn't care if you could buy this in front of the washroom of a Nascar event, or in a backcountry gas station....this beer is EXCEPTIONAL. Never thought a Canadian beer would ever exceed something by Unibroue....I thought wrong. 819 charactersvikingmike, Oct 22, 2009
4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a snifter.
Absolutely beautiful looking stout out of the bottle. Ridiculously dark and impossible to see through. Another brew that looks as if it could run a car. A good pour gives it a finger-sized head that's lightish brown and dissipates slowly, leaving a thin film at the top with a good amount of curly, lazy lacing. The smell is almost all coffee; if I didn't know better, I'd think I got this from Starbucks or some other coffee shop. There's a very slight malt undertone behind the coffee, as well as a bit of an alcoholic tinge. 
The first sip gave me a bit of an alcoholic twinge, which was pretty surprising, but it gave way to the signature coffee flavoring. Bitterness is present throughout and lingers into the aftertaste, but it's coffee bitterness, not hops, which were actually not detectable at all. Coffee gives way to some dark chocolate flavoring as well as some very very slight malty character. Back end finishes off somewhat sweet. Coffee and chocolate stay long into the aftertaste, leaving you wondering if you just drank espresso or a beer. Aside from the initial twinge, there is very little alcohol taste present. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, lightly creamy with a body that lingers on the full side of medium. 
Drinkability is fairly good for such a high ABV brew. The look, smell and taste certainly entice you to drink more. However, unlike coffee, you probably shouldn't down a lot of these to try and wake up. As an after-dinner dessert-type drink, definitely. 1,508 charactersr0nyn, Oct 21, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Starts off with a nice nearly black pour into a goblet with a a medium bodied dark tan head about half an inch and dissipates in seconds leaving some minor lacing. Smell is of strong coffee with slight hints of chocolate and roasted malts. Alcohol sits at 9.5% giving it a bit of a kick but worth it all the while. Flavor is excellent with the coffee standing out tremendously but very well balanced with the other ingredients. I would have to say this is the best beer provided by Dieu Du Ciel and have drank it several times and hope there are many more to come. I revisit it regularly and have several in the basement aging just to see if it develops to be anything different. Can't wait to see what comes of it if anything. This is definitely not a beer to miss out on. If you have a chance to try this delicious concoction, take it. 837 charactersBigDank, Oct 21, 2009

Before I opened the bottle I gave it a swirl and the top of the neck was temporarily coated in oily liquid. This beer is thick.
Pours obsidian with barely a glint of amber light showing around the extremities. The rocky tan head dissipates quickly but coats the glass in lace ridges and patches. the aroma is *shock of all shocks* of coffee. Delicious fresh dark roasted arabica beans, mingling with cocoa and even some caramel/maple syrup. The taste is tremendously intense with espresso richness mixing with hot chocolate powder, high quality dark chocolate, anise, acrid black malt, and a soft, complimentary alcohol. Hops are in the back but perform their function dutifully. The mouthfeel is inifitely thick and velvety with soft carbonation. The finish is like a mocha latte with some hop leaf and pretty much no alcohol flavor that would betray the 9.5%.
This is one of the great Stouts, scratch that, beers in the world. Rich, complex, impossibly easy to drink. A must try, especially if you like coffee. 1,095 charactersCAMRAhardliner, Oct 21, 2009

S- Coffee beans. This is unappologetically a coffee beer. Very intense, very strong, very inviting. Pretty dead-on coffee aroma... smells like a strong iced coffee.
T- Impossibly coffee-like. More so than any other 'coffee' stout I've ever had. The taste is dead-on, from the acidity to the bitterness in the finish. Truly one-of-a-kind. Where's the beer?
M- A bit syrupy, a bit sluggish, would have liked more carbonation. Still, kind of nitpicking, though, really good overall.
D- Moderate. Almost too much like a coffee. If you like coffee in your beer, you will go nuts for this one. I really enjoyed it, although I don't know if I'll be seeking this one out again... maybe I like my beer a bit more beer-like. The abundance of coffee has decimated any so-called 'beer qualities'. 848 charactersShogoKawada, Oct 20, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5An inky black abyss subsumes the mocha froth floating above it. This beer is a black hole - not even light escapes. It smells of black coffee, dark chocolate, and sweet caramel. Maybe even a hint of condensed milk. Alcohol is apparent in the aroma. The taste is coffee, coffee, coffee with hints of the chocolate and caramel found in the nose. There's just enough sweetness to balance out that intense black coffee flavour. Dark roast bitterness lasts long into the aftertaste. This wasn't just brewed with fair trade coffee beans, it was brewed with lots of them. The alcohol (9.5%ABV) is warming, and I can feel my cheeks beginning to flush. Full bodied with low carbonation. Smooth and creamy. Each mouthful leaves you looking forward to the next.
I wanted to open another as soon as I finished my first. I have class tomorrow, so I wont. I really want to though. I want to buy more and hoard it jealously, but I'm not sure if I could hold onto it long enough to consider it hoarding. 988 charactersmintjellie, Oct 20, 2009

4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've now had the good fortune to try this beer on cask, on tap and in bottle, and this review is an average of all three versions. The cask is by far the best (and in some respect is seems like a completely different beer), while the bottled and kegged version seem to be equivalent.
As it pours a slightly satanic aura emerges with a cloud of mocha bubbles transitioning to depths of midnight black. What a majestic appearance! A super thick cake of a head leaves heavy sheets of lace all the way to the bottom of the glass. The only fault I can find is that it would be nicer to have a slightly thicker cap come the finish, but this seems like a minor quibble
Aromas of coffee, cream, chocolate and caramel waft enticingly upwards and the first sip cannot come soon enough, but it is worth taking the time to appreciate the intense bouquet the brewer has crafted here. While I wouldn't describe the coffee aromas as that of an espresso, I would say that there's a nice dark roast in here, and I'm curious what they use. What also impresses me is that the coffee is not allowed to overpower the other elements in the nose, and it immediately strikes me as more balanced than most coffee flavoured beers.
The taste is of an extremely smooth, and perhaps as divine as the aroma suggests. Creamy dark roasted coffee, with some cocoa powder and alcohol in the aftertaste. Dark fruits and Christmas memories linger in the background. Whippings of milk chocolate cut the coffee bitterness and bring things to a delicate and beautiful balance. The cask version takes this up a notch, and the intensity of the coffee, cream and chocolate becomes almost dizzying. The mouthfeel is just amazing - heavy and viscous, yet delightfully smooth, and again, the cask version takes this idea and runs with it. The intensity of the flavour combines with a weight which gives the impression of table cream to create a truly decadent experience.
What really marks this beer out is how ridiculously drinkable it is. Without doubt its the best coffee beer I've had, and certainly the best coffee accented imperial stout. The flavours are in perfect balance, and there's just enough sugar to cut through all of the coffee roast to make it insanely easy to drink. Péché Mortel is widely viewed as the best offering from this brewery and the best beer out of Canada. It should be considered one of the best beers in its class in the world. 2,421 charactersbobsy, Oct 19, 2009
4.78/5  rDev +8.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a tulip from a 12oz bottle. 
A - Black. Black like the vacuum of space on the fringe of the universe. I held it up to the light repeatedly and nothing got through. It's opaque. It also poured a nicely proportioned mocha brown head which eventually receded into a ring which left some nice lacing.
S - Coffee, Chocolate, more coffee, some other malty smells, and more coffee. It's really nice coffee though. 
T - BOOYAH! That's coffee! Really, if you're a fan of coffee, this stuff is mind blowing. It's the purest essence of powerful espresso in a beer. It's borderline to a coffee liqueur. The flavours are very deep and require a slow and careful sipping for maximum enjoyment. Slight hoppy bitterness follows mingling beautifully with the lingering coffee flavour preparing the palate for the next sip. 
M - Definitely of the heavy side. It's very smooth and velvety with mild carbonation but even a little feels like a mouthful.
D - I don't know what to say about this. I'm not even sure I understand the relevance of this category. No, you can't drink a lot of hit. It's rich and decadent like a chocolate fudge cake. You only want one slice, but that's hardly a negative. So I gave it a 4.5 because i wasn't sure what to put. It goes down smooth, but it's intensity will burn you out. 
Notes:
This beer to me is the essence of "doing one thing extremely well". Yes, the beer is one dimensional, but it's a bloody amazing dimension. I really see this beer shining most when paired with food. The easy way would be paring it with a rich chocolate for dessert, but I think it could really shine next to a Vindaloo or some other extremely pungent food as it has the fortitude for pretty much anything. Be daring. 1,733 charactersclockwerk, Oct 18, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Nothing particularly awesome or bad about the appearance... it's good tho.. I guess it's kind of hard to get the appearance of a stout wrong. Very foamy head that sparkles... looks like styrofoam at first. Pitch back. In a guinness glass of all glasses so it looks like I"m drinking guinness. A very expensive, French-Canadian guinness.
I like that in the aroma you can tell that they used actual coffee and that the aroma isn't just coming from the malt. A strong blustery aroma of vanilla and coffee served over ice... I intentionally let my bottle sit out for a while to warm up so hopefully it isn't too cold. Very sweet as well, a little syrupy just in the aroma which is weird but not unpleasant. Reminds me of an imperial stout I did at home. 
Taste is great at first but fizzles out short of the "Founders Breakfast Stout Coffee Bonanza" that it otherwise reminded me of. Very strong espresso taste blends with some chocolate towards the end. You can even get a faint hint of British hops accenting the flavor. Pretty damn nice. No real roastyness or stout flavors are very aggressive other than the coffee, which we know doesn't come wholly from the malt. Seems like there's a normal stout underneath the coffee that just sort of backs it up. 
Mouthfeel is creamy, but neither pretentious nor cheesy. Blends perfectly well with the coffee and the alcohol. 
This is my new go-to impy stout when I can afford it since we don't get Founders here. Thank you Canada. 1,474 characterswiseguy142, Oct 18, 2009

The pour is solid black with only a hint of brown hues. Two fingers of brown head linger for a while and leave a nice amount of lacing.
The strong nose is of coffee with hints of chocolate. The alcohol is very apparent as well. The taste is coffee, coffee, coffee, chocolate and more coffee. At times it is sweet, like someone has put in a few lumps of sugar while at other times it takes on a more bitter flavour, but at all times coffee is there. Can't really ask for more in a coffee stout.
Mouthfeel is pleasantly thick and creamy. It wasn't hard to drink one bottle, but the alcohol started getting to me toward the end. However, this is definitely a sipper.
This may very well be the best beer (or at the very least stout) that I have ever drank. If at all possible, try it. 823 charactersCityBoy1986, Oct 16, 2009
4.12/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a bottle into a dogfish head signature glass.
The beer is pitch black with a thick mocha head. As the head fades it leaves a persistent foamy and oily lacing.
The smell is roasted espresso and bitter chocolate, there isn't much else to it, but the scent is really strong and inviting.
The taste is roasted malts that usher you quickly to a strong coffee flavor. Beyond the coffee the flavors fade to a bitter chocolate, then a milk chocolate, and finally more coffee, I also pick up a bit of coconut in there, but it's fleeting. The aftertaste of this beer is worth noting, I can't tell if I have had a sip of coffee seconds ago or a sip of beer. The intensity of the coffee profile is excellent.
The beer is thick and full bodied, but well carbonated. The 9.5% abv is well hidden by the strong flavors, this is a very good coffee stout. 853 charactersrpstevens, Oct 15, 2009

Peche Mortel pours black with the creamiest tan head, starting at one finger thick and dwindling to a thin ring. Spotty lacing. A bit of dark ruby at the edges when held to the light.
The smell is all coffee up front. Fresh grounds followed by a hint of caramel/ toffee sweetness and rounded out with a touch of dark chocolate. Deeeelicious.
Tastes just like it smells. Wonderful dark roasted coffee grounds. Very bitter and roasted finish, like a strong espresso. This is the most coffe-forward coffee stout I have yet to experience. This beer defines the style for sure.
Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I would like. Perhaps a bit too carbonated for my taste, but still a very solid beer overall. Drinkability is very high given the ABV and style. If only I had this available in my area, I might just have to start my morning with this one. 945 charactersMcDiddyPop, Oct 13, 2009

Presentation: 11.5 oz bottle. Contemporary fantasy design and illustration (a la Dave McKean) around the image of a snake over an Eve. Short front description and brief side narrative generally noting main ingredients and intent. Does shows date of bottling (there seems to be a side numbered calendar with the faintest of scratches on 0 and 9 but it is not clear), and shows Alc. by Vol. (9.5%) Poured into a snifter.
A - Black body with an opaque pour that gives a short-lived brown creamy head that dies with minimal lacing and a thin ringed surface cap.
S - Beautiful dark bitter roasted coffee aroma, with malty nuances and a distant memory of a chocolate touch.
T - Bitter and bitter-sweet identity. The malt provides the base for the coffee to bond through without losing any of its identity and gaining the stout backbone complexity.
M - Softly full bodied, with medium carbonation and very smooth.
D - Very nicely drinkable in particular if you enjoy dark roasted coffees, espresso-like with its own original bitter nuances interwoven with a malty stout.
Notes: Part of the hype is justified: it is a notable and quality brew. The employment of fair trade coffee would feel more like an actual incentive and not a borderline frivolity if it specified from where or what they are using, in this form it feels gratuitous but tastes all right. A total sipper for coffee and stout lovers. I have a couple of coffee friends I want to share the next one with. 1,572 charactersDaniellobo, Oct 13, 2009
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into a snifter.
Upon prying open the cap, an immense roasted coffee aroma arose from the bottle. Highly appealing on the nose. Appearance was thick and slick oily black with one or two audible 'glugs' emitting from the bottle. A nice thick and dark toffee colored head rose from the brew and was static for only a few minutes before dying down to a thin cap. Nice strands of soapy lacing appear after each sip as well. Roasted coffee is predominantly the heaviest on the nose with some maltiness to it. The alcohol is quite noticeable in the aroma too.
The taste is very much full of the roasted coffee as well - astringency and all. Black coffee with no sugar or cream constructs the majority in the flavor profile that falls back on a melted bittersweet chocolate essence. Sorta like a truffle for dessert. Caramel and cream kind of hint their way towards the end as well and ends with the burnt coffee bean bitterness on the tongue. Very delicate, yet still as complex. Alcohol is actually masked pretty well; I couldn't taste much of it. 
Mouthfeel has a milky and smooth feel to it. Medium- to full-bodied at best with not much of a carbonated presence. No complaints here. And the drinkability is well-deserved. As the winter approaches, this is definitely recommended for the season.
A great brew for all coffee fans. Absolutely worth the high honors. 1,370 charactersinfi, Oct 11, 2009

4.28/5  rDev -2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4This was a tough one to rate - great complexity, and a true coffee stout (vs. double/imperial).
Pours with a copper hued deep brown color, resulting in surprisingly large 2f, creamy tan head slowly fading to thick film. Tremendous lacing. 
Smell has some sweetness but mostly a wicked bitterness - intially coming thru with tannic red wine qualities, and then moving on as it warmed to bittersweet chocolate and coffee beans. 
Flavor is of raw tobacco leaves, coffee beans, bitter bark, and a touch of balancing bittersweet chocolate. The intensity of the flavors do a nice job to mask the alcohol. 
For all the previously mentioned bitter qualities, the mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth. Perfectly carbonated. Pleasant aftertaste. 
Drinkability is large, but make no mistake, this is a sipper. I love big beers, but would have trouble going thru more than 2 of these due to the bitterness. 896 charactersBeerImmediately, Oct 07, 2009

T: Rich black roasted coffee flavor which is followed by a sweet chocolate taste. There are also hints of vanilla/caramel, but the coffee is definitely more in the fore front, and making itself known in this brew. 
M: Thick and creamy like whole milk in a glass jar fresh off a farm. That left the most delicious after taste present in your mouth well after the beer had been consumed.
D: This beer is one of our favorites, and we could easily drink a few of these in one night. If you like coffee/beer this is a must have.

A-Pours pitch black with a 3/4 finger sandy head that is active and bubbly for a decent amount of time. The head eventually rests at a nice filmy layer.
S-Dark roasted malt dominates the nose. There is also a fair amount of sweet chocolate that is present. It smells of good, freshly roasted coffee. I find a lot of coffee beers to smell more like a pitcher of coffee that has been left sitting out for hours. As it warms I get some molasses and vanilla.
T-There is some definite bitterness from the coffee and roasted malts. The coffee flavor is a lot more subtle than I expected from the nose. The sweet chocolate is very prevalent on the finish. It has a good coffee aftertaste. Caramel and vanilla flavors come and go throughout the session. All of the flavors come together very nicely im this beer.
M-Thinner bodied for such a high abv stout. It is creamy and smooth with a good level of carbonation.
D-A very good sipper that is best enjoyed as a nightcap.
I always seem to miss this one on Bay Area shelves and ended up buying it in New Orleans. This is well worth the hype and a great blended coffee stout. 1,207 charactersmjl21, Oct 06, 2009

Deep complexity. Lots of chocolate and coffee. Rich and delicious. Reminiscent of a mocha milkshake. Noticeable hop presence is nice. Dark raisiny fruit. Sweet toasted malt is not burnt tasting which is a plus. Coffee is noticed most at the end. Alcohol rears its head a moderate amount as well.
Full bodied, slick and smooth oil like feel. Enough soft carbonation to keep the flavors rolling. Good amount of heat from the booze. Dry and clean finish.
Not as much of a sipper as one would think. Well hidden alcohol. Hard to set this down. One of the best examples of the style. 730 charactersjera1350, Oct 06, 2009
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4800th review for Péché Mortel :)
A- Pours an ink black color with a huge mocha colored head. A bit of scattered lacing on the sides. No light is visible through the glass.
S- Freshly ground coffee beans with some dark chocolate bitterness. A faint whiff of alcohol.
T- Overwhelmingly roasted coffee flavor with bitter cocoa nib finish. Espresso and smoke add to the coffee onslaught. The alcohol is quite apparent and stings a bit upon a large gulp. The slightest amount of sweet malt is noticeable as a small relief to the bitterness of the coffee and cocoa.
M- Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Alcohol isn't very hidden.
D- A really interesting brew that is a must try for coffee fans. 700 charactersprojectflam86, Oct 06, 2009
4.27/5  rDev -3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4bottle to brandy snifter on a lonely night.
App: Jet black w/creamy brown head. Avg. carbonation.
Smell: Best feature. Coffee, tobacco leaves, roastiness, chocolate sweetness.
Taste: Less intense than smell actually. Chocolate, coffee, burnt roasty/toastiness. Alcohol halfway through lingering to end, but not overpowering.
Mouth: good but not overly exciting or viscous.
Drinkability: Good for an IS, but there are better ones w/bigger strength nowadays. IE: speedway, Black Tuesday, Serpent, etc. etc.
Overall: Good for a stout, but for an imperial not as full as I would expect. Smell was the standout of this beer for me. Would be in my top 20 IS's but that's about it. 680 charactersbret27, Oct 01, 2009

Aroma of cocoa and molasses, some espresso notes.
Rich and deep flavors of bitter chocolate and espresso, molasses and licorice. Notes of charred bark and smoke. Hints of fruity tang, notes of brandy. Smooth, alcohol does not take over.
Rich and full mouthfeel, finishes a little powdery and tannic. The frothy head is still there, and wraps up every sip with a creamy punctuation mark. Slight warming to the cheeks.
Great beer and drinkable. Thanks to joerodiii for passing this one my way. 592 charactersfar333, Sep 29, 2009

This is a thick beer that pours a nice black with brown edges when held to the light and a small head that settles quickly to a brown ring that lasts for the rest of the experience. It smells like roasty coffee. Very pleasant but not quite 5-worthy. The taste is a lot of coffee but not the bitch slap I was expecting. Much more complex than the smell... it's changing as it warms with the chocolate becoming more prominent. The mouthfeel is good and drinkability would be high except there's some alcohol taste towards the end and the price prevents me from buying much of this. Overall an awesome beer; one of the best coffee stouts I've had but not perfect. 882 charactersltjska04, Sep 29, 2009

Wonderful lacing appears in the glass.
Huge roasted notes and as this warms everything is only getting bolder. 
This has a sweet initial taste with a huge bittering aftertaste. The mouthfeel is super smooth and I couldn't ask for more. Toffee and dark chocolate accompany these espresso flavors. This is one intense beer and a grand imperial stout. 515 charactersstewart124, Sep 28, 2009

Pours a almost black brew, with a near brown three finger chunky head - nice lace.
Smells of sweet roasted coffee, malts and chocolate.
Tastes robust and thiner mouthfeel then I expected, has a bitter coffee flavor that really spices the tongue. The roasted malt flavors really shine through as you drink. Nice job of hiding the alcohol. Has a nutty flavor as well. Nice hop presence as well. This beer really warms you as you drink it.
This brew is a sipper, not to be drank to get buzzed - although a few of these will easily achieve that. It is a brew to sit and savor. A very big coffee flavor and aftertaste, very roasted brew. This brew is very good. 686 charactersmagine, Sep 26, 2009
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a ~12oz. bottle into a pint glass:
Appearance and smell-Poured a cream thick almost pitch black with a thing tan head which left some slight lacing. Smells of definite sweet milk chocolate. Scent of alcohol is very present. Trailing this is a bit of vanilla and roasted coffee. Very sweet smelling brew.
Taste and Mouthfeel-Taste was initially very roasty, sweet chocolate malt was very present. Creamy vanilla/chocolate aftertaste was great. Mouthfeel really matched it. A nice thick chewy sweet brew. Much less coffee than expected. There was a bit of hop bitterness but the sweet finish sat right on it, but it was present none the less.
Drinkability-The smell and lingering creamy aftertaste really make it hard to let the glass sit long for sure. This was definitely a spendy bottle but will definitely be going back for more for certain occassions.
God, I wanted to not enjoy this thing due to the price in all honesty. 941 charactersblackenmn, Sep 25, 2009
4.27/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured into my Stone imperial pint black, black, black and that's no joke. Thin head but good retention. I swirl and pour in the dregs at the bottom of the bottle.
Nose is actually not as heavy on the coffee as I thought it might be. Minor licorice, some roasty malts, vanilla. Edit: Oh wait, my first bottle must have been old or something. With this other bottle, there's no mistaking it. 
This beer settles upon the palate with a ton of bitter coffee - it has to be some kind of dark roast, as there is pretty big non-hop bitterness...like chewing on a coffee bean. Along for the ride are the usual imperial stout flavor notes of bitter chocolate and char. A little alcohol flits in and out of the flavor profile. Aftertaste goes and goes and goes. 
Big, robust feel, with soft bubbles. 
Definitely a big, serious beer. I find it too potent to think about having more than one, even if I had another bottle. As this beer seems to be made with a dark, fairly bitter coffee blend, this one is for real coffee aficionados. It does not have a more mainstream bright coffee-ice-cream taste like Founders Breakfast - if you like drinking your coffee black as I sometimes do, this is one to try.
Consider this your fair warning. This is serious beer with all the intense roasted and acrid character of a freshly-pulled espresso shot. It is quite the punchy, balls-to-the-wall beer. 1,382 charactersPatrick999, Sep 25, 2009

12oz bottle. '09 vintage. Love the bottle, can not wait to try this sin.
A: Lights out in a coal mine black, very small tan head, with great lacing. 
S: Smells like something you would get at a starbucks can you say espresso baby! 
T: huge roasted coffee flavor, which is followed bye sweet chocolate. I also taste a splash of vanilla and a hint of caramel. The balance is spot on for a coffee stout. 
M: Carbonation makes s this brew very creamy it is a little thinner then I would have like, but I can live with it.
D: This stout is an easy drinker, but it does have a warming trend that hits about the time the glass is gone. I see the bottom of my glass now, which makes me sad, they only had one bottle. 
Thoughts: This sin is definitely a win. I would like to try this with some age on it. 813 charactersearthboundagain, Sep 24, 2009

Smell: rich and sweet with a huge nose of coffee. Some chocolate notes pierce the coffee veil.
Taste: giant coffee flavor assaults the tongue, followed by fruity esters and a bit of an alcoholic bite, then a nice bitter denouement. I think this one is growing on me.
Mouthfeel: full bodied yet with a slight astringent character, low but nice carbonation.
Drinkability: delicious but with this ABV and cumulative flavor effect, I think I'm limited to one. 568 charactersflagmantho, Sep 24, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance: This beer was poured into my dfh snifter with a brown one finger head that stuck around. The beer itself is jet black with no chance of seeing through it. There is even lacing. This is just a really impressive looking beer.
Smell: The second I started pouring this super pungent, incredible smelling beer the smell just hit me like bricks. The smell of coffee just hits you immediately. Side by side with the coffee aroma is the chocolate. I mean we are taking about a chocolate aroma that is stronger than beers with chocolate in the name. You can also find a decent amount of alcohol in the nose, but it perfectly balances out the nose. I am also getting some caramel. 
Taste: Wow this is insane. The flavor is a great deal like the smell, the upfront wonderful coffee followed by chocolate. So much wonderful roasted malt flavor. There is hop bitterness, to which the bitterness of the roasted malt contributes very nicely. This bitterness seems to help or scarily well interplay with a somewhat dry finish which really makes this beer.
Mouthfeel: The beer has a nice and smooth mouthfeel. It is heavy boded. The bitterness seems to give the beer a tiny bit of a bite, but the low carbonation really smooths things out.
Drinkability: This may be my favorite beer out of any I have had. The intensity and boldness really makes this a real sipper. I just wish I could get this a great deal easier. 1,414 charactersOnThenIn, Sep 22, 2009

A: Pitch black pour. Very small amount of tan head that fades. Really stellar lacing
S: Huge wave of coffee and roasted malts. Some small amount of chocolate present along with a smidge of alcohol. 
T: Almost spot on to the taste. Big coffee flavor with ample roastiness. Followed up by sweet bitter chocolate and molasses. Also present are some faint hints of vanilla and caramel. There is some bitter hop/alcohol bite on the finish, but it's not out of control. Overall very nice and balanced. Perhaps a tad too much coffee for my liking.
M: Very good carbonation helps make this a creamy delight. Not too thick, but not too thin. Just right for this style of stout.
D: Very easy drinker for a big stout. This is a pretty fresh bottle, and it's still a little hot. Other than that these 12oz went like Flo-Jo on Blow.
A very nice offering from our neighbors to the north. This one easily lives up to it's reputation. I think it'll be even more up my alley with a year or so on it. Looking forward to revisiting it. 1,175 charactersheliosphann, Sep 21, 2009

Pours a rich, ruby-tinted black with a frothy light tan head. Looks more like a porter than an imperial stout.
Aromas of deep, rich, roasted coffee beans, burnt grain, and caramel sweetness. Sweet caramel entry, turning toward warm alcohol in the middle before making way for roasty coffee and a touch of hop bitterness in the finish. As the beer warms, a Belgian-like bright, fruity yeast character comes through in both the nose and the palate, adding complexity.
Medium to heavy bodied with a sense of oiliness and just a bit sticky. 576 characterswnh, Sep 20, 2009

Aroma is roasted malt, some dark fruit, traces of hop, and pounds of vanilla. Coffee was barely detectable. Flavor was absolutely delicious: more vanilla with a pleasant and clean bitterness, with an alcoholic exhale. Strangely, an effect like coffee without the coffee flavor. Extremely rich and robust! Mouth was on target as well. It seems to coat your mouth, with a deep, alcoholic warming effect. Lovely! 469 charactersgyllstromk, Sep 20, 2009

This was by far the least favorite of the grouping. Nothing special here at all.
It pours a medium dark black, still very dark in the light, light tan head, lacing ok.
The aroma is very strong, mostly of burnt wood and alcohol surprisingly don't get any coffee. The smell is pretty off putting, make you almost not want to drink it.
Taste is very light compared to the aroma, you think its just going to hit you in the mouth but it doesn't. You taste coffee from start to finish, that's it. Not very complex or compelling. Mouthfeel is bad, not very drinkable. 704 charactersjrallen34, Sep 20, 2009

Coffee, coffee, coffee. Dark, french pressed coffee. Not Maxwell House coffee. Not "water dressed in brown" coffee (to quote Ani DiFranco). Not Starbucks House Blend coffee - but COFFEE. This tastes and smells as if it were a very well-made, french pressed, "french roast" cup of coffee. Slick and smooth, with a an oily presence, as it should because it tastes like dark, french pressed coffee. A hint of smoke, which makes sense, because it tastes like dark, french pressed coffee. Slight bitter finish with a presence of dark chocolate -- like a good french pressed coffee. Have I said that this tastes like good, dark, french pressed coffee?
It's not something to drink all night. It's not something to drink all day. It's just something to drink at a point in time and that point in time is the present moment in which you drink it. It's very zen...and it tastes like damn good coffee!
I love this. 1,123 charactersZraly, Sep 19, 2009

A: Aggressive pour yields 1.5 fingers of thick pillowy brown head with excellent retention. Opaque light black/dark brown liquid. Stunning beer.
S: Some coffee with roasted barley notes. Relatively mild aroma. Some esters. Disappointing simplicity.
T: Very roasty, coffee bitterness is pronounced. Alcohol starrts coming in on the 3rd drink and dominates after that (minus points). Tasty and despite slight booziness, fairly balanced.
M: Not hot or warm even, despite my expectations. This is a positive aspect definitely. Coffee bitterness is strong. Nice and chewy.
D: Tasty, but not terribly complex. One of the most drinkable Imperial Stouts I've had - maybe even sessionable (though I'm feeling that alcohol). I'd order another pint, but I think this one is priced out of the buying-a-sixer range for me. 838 charactersdfillius, Sep 17, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5First off, this beer absorbs light. It's that dark in color. The head never grew beyond a pinky and was tan in color. There is a little retention. The blackest stout yet, in my short life. The smell is explosive and full of strong roasted coffee with a crème smell. I'm talking about good coffee too, like the inside of your favorite coffee shop, and also a kind of a sugar smell. There is also a bit of alcohol in the nose but it's very faint and well controlled. I also get a bit of cinnamon in this too.
Glug glug glug.
Whoa... Tastes like coffee with a smooth, silky malt character. I also notice the instant warming feeling from this. It's as drinkable as coffee in my book. The coffee flavor is incredibly concentrated and the nose I get as I drink from my snifter really makes me feel like I'm drinking coffee. Towards the end of the taste is a bitter bite from both the alcohol and the bean flavor. There may be just a bit of dark ripe fruits, but not as I've tasted in other RIS's. The concentrated goodness that is this beer is an amazing thing to have pulled off. The mouth feel was a little flat I suppose but I can hardly hate it for that. 1,155 charactersThur123, Sep 15, 2009

I'm probably wrong, but I think it's an abstract drawing of Eve and the snake because Péché Mortel in French means Mortal Sin. Whatever it is, it's a cool label. Just below the woman is where they tell you it's an Imperial Coffee Stout brewed with Fair Trade Coffee. To the left of the picture is a description of the beer, address of the brewery, and the email address for the illustrator. To the right is where they put all the mandatory US information. A best before date or brewed year would have been helpful, but I guess the label art was good enough.
Appearance: Since this beer is highly rated, I wanted to pour this beer into a special glass, so I poured it into my Unibroue Tulip. They weren't joking when they said it was brewed with coffee. If you're ever seen an espresso straight from the machine before, then you know what this beer looks like. It's the same pitch black color. This beer is so damn dark that light will bounce right off the beer's solid black color. If you got a really clean glass, all you you will see is utter darkness and your reflection. On top of this onyx colored beer was a thick dark mocha colored head of foam. At its tallest, it was close to 1 inch in height. It had pretty good retention that left behind a silky mocha film and a few small blots of lace. It looks like coffee, let's see if it smells like coffee.
Smell: Does it smell like coffee? Oh Hell Yes! This beer was just bursting with the strong scent of finely roasted coffee beans. You actually smell that these were high quality coffee beans and not cheapo coffee beans. The aroma of these coffee beans are so good that you can easily stick your nose into the glass and breathe in the rich scent of coffee for a couple of minutes. My nose wasn't able to pick out much behind all the coffee. I was only able to pick out a hint of caramel and a touch of roasted malts. Despite it's lack of wide range of aromas, this aroma will never get boring. It's a must smell!
Taste: Looks like coffee, smells like coffee, but does it taste like coffee? You bet your ass it does! The taste was all about the bitter dry roasted coffee beans. I thought I could taste some dark roasted malts and dark chocolate here and there, but I just chalked that up to the coffee beans recreating these tastes. I sure hope you like to taste of coffee because this taste will not let up or let through any other flavors. A variety of flavors would have been nice, but the strong taste of coffee is more than enough. I'm sure that this strong coffee taste will please any coffee or beer drinker.
Mouthfeel: This was a full bodied Coffee Stout with a good level of carbonation and a thick full flavored dry roasted coffee bean aftertaste. Like the initial taste, the aftertaste was all about the coffee. This thick coffee aftertaste has nowhere to go, so it will stick around for quite some time. It will take a whole glass of water to get rid of the aftertaste. Even though it's full bodied, you really can't taste or feel the 9.5% ABV. The ABV was completely masked the strong roasted coffee presence.
Drinkability: If it looks like a coffee, smells like a coffee, tastes like a coffee, then it must a coffee? Wrong! It's actually a beer! The only problem I see with this beer is that this small bottle is pricey! It's pricey, but it's worth it! That is if you really like good beers and a finely roasted coffee. 3,532 charactersAltBock, Sep 15, 2009

A - Pours a pitch black, totally opaque. A thin, tan head appears briefly and receds to a thin collar around the glass.
S - Smell is of dark roasted, black coffee primarily, which some licorice mixed in. A good dose of alcohol and a bit of dark fruit too.
T - A touch of sweetness in a cup of black coffee with a shot of vodka in it. Alcohol has a strong presence here. Coffee is prominent in the flavor and blends with some molasses and licorice.
M - Medium bodied, maybe a little on the thin side in feel, but still seems to coat the entire mouth with flavor. Carbonation seems a little high for the style, but isn't distracting...still works pretty well.
D - Drinkability is decent on this one. Alcohol is too noticeable or this would be a little bit higher. Flavor is really good tho...good beer overall, one in a sitting is perfect for me. 894 charactersportia99, Sep 13, 2009

A very heavy pour, rich and creamy. Black as night. Roughly a fingers worth of head, creamy and brown. Laces well for it's full body, many sporadic spiderwebs adorn.
Smell is nothing short of amazing. Deep, mysterious, roasted, and sweet. It smells so good, you'll be sniffing it till the last drop.
Now, I don't drink coffee. I was rather skeptical about picking this one up because of that, afraid that it would ruin my experience.... I was wrong. Though the flavor is strongly there, its... tasty! Turns out I do like coffee, but instead of milk or cream, I like a good stout in it. The coffee is there, but theres so much else going on that combine to give one of the greatest beer experiences I've had. It's bitter, but finishes sweet and clean. It's smoky and roasted, malty and strong. 
mmm.
The feel is heavy, and it makes you want to linger as you savor each slow sip. Very thick and wonderFULL.
The ABV is no pushover, and after a couple it will remind you of that. It's hidden very well though. You can session this very easily, but I wouldn't recommend it.
This is an elite brew. If you can get your hands on it, do it. Theres only one place here I can find it, and I have been told that they wont be carrying it soon. :( I guess I'm going to have to buy up all that I can... 1,340 charactersEgadBananas, Sep 13, 2009

A: Black black with a thin, 1/2 finger cake batter colored head with decent retention but no lacing.
S: Coffee slams your olfactory unit every which way with strong espresso intensity. What's leftover is pulverized by the deep dark maltiness and leafy hops. There is a fair amount of detectable alcohol which singes the nostrils and lends a cherry fruitiness to the nose.
T: The flavor is extremely bold with espresso flavors tinged with bitter dark chocolate and matched with a dark maltload of epic proportions. The leafy hoppiness further adds to this bitter bomb with the booziness being a flaw that doesn't spoil the brew but doesn't enhance it in the way it does in the aroma profile. 
M: Full-bodied and chewy with some acrid astringency which prevents a major overload on this flavor. The aftertaste is big and long with bitter leafy hops, dark chocolate, toasted malts, and espresso all in there.
D: A really fine imperial stout that would be better off with less booziness and some downshifting in the coffee department. That being said, this is a unique taste experience that will be loved by coffee-stout heads everywhere. 1,286 charactersargock, Sep 10, 2009

The appearance was great, deep black with dark dark brown on the edges. Damn bartender poured it with little head, but it was light brown. No lacing on the glass. 
The smell was of bitter coffee or espresso beans. Cocoa. 
The taste was good, it had a great coffee espresso flavor to it that I enjoyed. It was a little hopped up for a RIS, the bitterness of hops with the bitterness of the coffee was a little much. Slight cocoa in the after notes, creamy black malt also. 
The mouthfeel was good, nothing great. Good carbonation, but with this one I would want to let it sit for a while and let it get to a more oil mouthfeel. I would also want to hops to die out, too much in the taste. The drinkability was good as well, nothing better than a stout with coffee.

4.72/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A late-night jaunt down to the old coffee shop with the fellas, it's just like old times, when we used to sneak out of the house to do nothing worse than smoke cigars and toilet paper houses. An espresso, of course, always the easy route, make it a double, beautiful black and frothy, leaves a few spots on the sides of the glass.
"So how's life in Denver? You? Wales? Atlanta?" Yeah, they all went their separate ways in the world, one to seminary, one to make his fortune, one followed his wife to Virginia... I'm still here, boys, when you come back to see the family, we'll have an espresso...
Aroma of rich, bitter coffee, the booze of earlier, a bit of chocolate, the usual suspects. 
"Not married yet?"
"No, it's happening soon though. I found her you know."
A bit of toasted almond there, Nougat, dates, figs, the dark beans with the dark grains, the sweet alcohol bringing them together...
Funny how you can just jump back into it, nothing really changes over the years, circumstances perhaps, but the deep bonds were forged, cemented years ago. Adventures, dates, heartbreaks, trouble, trips, old jokes, they all come back up. Nothing's really changed.
Flavor is a rich mesh of the aforementioned notes, plus a bit of tobacco, perhaps even a cigarette, "smoke 'em while you got 'em, they're sure to be illegal soon..."
"Family? good. Wife? good. Job? same old." 
A coffee-and-cream blend with rich dark roast in the finish and a boozy note from the alcohol, sweet and creamy, toothy, nutty, like a good mild cigar, the rich tobacco notes, a faint, almost oak-barrel sour in the finish, surprising but not unwelcome.
So we catch up on the triumphs and tragedies since the last time, but it's all details. We see the same truths, we are common men, we can be angry or laugh, it doesn't change. Across the nation, across the world... right where we left off.
Creamy and thick, the slight tingling, warming, and astringent dryness balances the syrupishness, and we could be here all night.
It will be like this until we begin to die off, no doubt. There's nothing we can't forgive or get past, no time that really matters all too much, the bonds were forged long ago, we'll always be the best of friends, the things our wives will never care about, we'll always have this in common. 2,288 characterskhiasmus, Sep 07, 2009
4.78/5  rDev +8.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into Delerium Noel snifter.
A- pitch black, thick syrupy pour, with a creamy brownish white head the looks like whipped cream
S- smells like a mug of some gourmet extra bold coffee. All coffee here
T: WOW... this is delicious!! The taste is a lot like the aroma, but much more pronounced. Everything is perfectly balanced and the 9.5% alcohol is hardly detectable. Perhaps one of the most balanced big stouts I've tried. Reminds me a lot of Founder's Breakfast stout. The finish is remarkable as it leaves a wonderful taste of coffee on the tongue.
M: velvety creamy texture with a heavy body
D: At 5.49 per 11.2 oz bottle, it would be tough to drink a lot of it. However, it is surprisingly drinkable and well balanced for the style. Bottom line is this beer perfectly marries coffee and beer and is among the best if not the best coffee stout I have tried. 865 charactershomebrew311, Sep 06, 2009
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My friends at Abe's Cold Beer in Bethlehem hooked me up with another fantastic brew. This one came with the high expectations of great reviews overall and from my fav BA's (BrentK56 to be exact).
A: Exquisite black color with a cappuccino colored head that leaves fantastic lacing on the glass.
S: Rich espresso aroma with a lovely roasted undertone.
T: Starts with a nice espresso flavor that builds into a chocolate and slight tobacco presence. Undertone brings a lovely bitter and astringent balance to the brew. Excellent balance from a mixture of such complex flavors.
M: Full bodied and creamy with modest carbonation and a wonderful espresso aftertaste.
D: A fantastic brew with amazing balance and a wonderful mixutre of flavors. This was a real tour de force and certainly lived up to it's hype. Quite a powerful brew with the hops and the coffee providing quite a punch, not for the faint of heart. My first brew from Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel, but based on this experience certainly not my last. Definitely a "go out of your way to find" brew, so get searching! 1,074 charactersjdg204, Sep 04, 2009

Smells of sweet malt, hops, alcohol, dark citrus, yeast, and some roasted malt. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy with an average carbonation level. There is a noticeable tartness and slight bitterness. Tastes of coffee, roasted malt, hops, alcohol, dark citrus, and slight yeast. Wow, a great beer overall with some slight dryness associated. 490 charactersTone, Sep 02, 2009

This beer is dark... extremely dark... Wesley Snipes dark... possess a glorious coffee colored head which remains throughout, the lacing is fantastic
I just walked into Starbucks and a someone has just ordered a six shot espresso this beer smells like a bag of coffee beans with a TRACE of dark roasted malts
Dark roasted malts are smothered by delicious roasted espresso flavors the coffee flavor of this beer is almost overwhelming a smaller taste detects notes of burnt raisin and chocolate this beers 9.5% alcohol content is masked very well, too well
This beer if full bodied, fluffy and creamy, absolutely delicious
Extremely drinkable for a beer of such creaminess, weight and complexity
This beer is awesome the best coffee stout I've ever had I strongly recommend it to anyone likes coffee or beer but be warned this beer is not for the faint of heart. 938 charactersHopBacchus, Sep 01, 2009
3.68/5  rDev -16.4%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4There's an upfront, rich, sweet, pruney aroma on this brew with obvious coffee. I get even more coffee in the flavor, but there's still a lot of that pruney/raisiny character. The coffee flavor is strong, although I've had better coffee flavors in other beers. The coffee in this brew seems a bit like old coffee grounds and/or overly charred coffee beans. I've had this one in the past, and I liked it better back then. I've had plenty of other coffee brews from around the world since then, so my tastes have become more refined. Having said that, I think PM is still a decent coffee brew. If you like coffee brews, definitely give PM a try, but there are plenty of other superior North American coffee brews now on the market. 729 charactersohmybock, Aug 29, 2009

Black with a large, foamy, muddy tan head. Pillowy lace and retention. Looks sinister.
Dark espresso , cocao and fig aroma. 
Quite frankly, this beer tastes like sexy, seductive evil. Dark roast espresso dominates with dark fruit, woody hop dark chocolate, and oaky char highlights. Lingering char and coffee aftertaste that lasts until the next sip. Though 9.5% abv I only had this in the cellar for a couple of months and didn't find the alcohol to be intrusive at all. 
One of the best beers I've had recently. 563 charactersdonkeyrunner, Aug 29, 2009

A - Pours a thick dark black. Completely solid; opaque; murky. Thin creamy head that doesn't stick around too long.
S - Big coffee smell, with a well roasted malt backbone. Slightly sweet. Hints of vanilla, chocolate.
T - Starts with a mocha taste, and is quickly followed up by the taste of a great stout. Rich roasted malt, interupted by the hops and a flash of alcohol. The aftertaste is all coffee, with traces of vanilla and chocolate.
M - Thick, oily with low to moderate carbonation. Very smooth actually, depite how full bodied this beer is, it is velvety smooth.
D - A tasty beer for sure. This is a bit of a sting from the alcohol. I think a bit of age might help that. Otherwise, a very very good beer. 737 charactersGenghis22, Aug 26, 2009

Aroma is strong coffee, roasted malty nuts and a hint of chocolate. Mouthfeel was full and rich, and the taste took the coffee and roasted nuts of the nose up a notch. At 9.5%, I was a little surprised that the alcohol never made itself known in either the nose or taste.
 This all rounded to a somewhat sweet, long and warming finish. 437 characterskimcgolf, Aug 23, 2009

A - Pours a solid, opaque, black with 2 fingers of mocha head. Dissipates moderately slow leaving nice lacing.
S - Light roast coffee, wafts of dark chocolate, and cherry esters. Light bitter hops too.
T - Light coffee, dark chocolate, and piney hops. Very rich as you can imagine.
M - Super full bodied, well balanced, smooth, and surprisingly no alcohol.
D - Definitely worth the hype as it is a great beer. Very rich and full-bodied. Wish I would have busted out a cigar. 512 charactersMisterClean, Aug 22, 2009

A- Pours jet black with a finger and a half of brown head into a snifter. Good lacing and excellent head retention.
S- Wow, this is probably one of the best smelling beers I've had. Lots of coffee, but not the overly roasted flavor like other coffee stouts. Also plenty of sweet, dark chocolate on the nose. These two dominating flavors complement each other very well.
T- I hate to have a large disparity between the smell and taste rankings, but this beer's main downfall was it's sweetness. There is a roasted flavor present, but the sweetness seems to really take hold and not let go. A bitter finish does arise eventually. Still, this beer tastes great.
M- Thick and a slightly oily feel. A little more carbonation than I'm used to in an Imperial Stout, but I think it does well in this beer.
D- Unfortunately, the high ABV and sweetness limits me to no more than one in a night. However, I kept wanting more and more as I drank it.
Overall, would I buy it again? Definitely. I think this is one of the best stouts I've had in awhile. Perhaps it is only surpassed by KBS in my books so far. 1,221 characterskbeals, Aug 22, 2009

A = Very dark mahogany, medium tan head of small bubbles, recedes relatively quickly leaving lacing and resolving into a layer of foam on surface.
S = Smells like dark roast coffee ground to an espresso powder, some smokiness. Quite strong espresso smell but not a lot else.
T = Very well balanced. As with the smell the dominant focus is on a very finely ground, dark roasted coffee bean, but there is also some bittersweet cocoa powder, dark fruits in the background.
M = Heavy body, great mouthcoating, luscious.
D = This is a tasty good brew, but it is not highly drinkable. A little goes a long way. That said, I will definitely come back to this one though. 704 charactersTraquairlover, Aug 21, 2009

Aroma is very nice, chocolate and coffee dominate, but you have to take it in strongly. The taste is more of the same, great sweetness and coffee presence, almost like a chocolate milkshake but with a hint of alcohol and a nice balancing bitterness. The mouthfeel is near perfect for me, it's creamy and weighty without turning into an oil slick or sludge. I could drink this all night. Bonus for a great label design. I love this beer. 507 characterssquaremile, Aug 21, 2009

The smell is really good with a roasted bitterness, a touch of caramel sweetness, tons of coffee and a touch of alcohol character. The aromas are pretty balanced and don't seem to be confused or competing. 
The taste is great with a really nice mouth feel. Creamy and sweet up front with a big coffee flavor following close after and lingering long into the finish. Hints of dark fruit and roasted malt also tease the palate. The finish is bitter with lots of coffee and a generous amount of alcohol. 
Very enjoyable, the alcohol is detectable but not overpowering. The coffee flavor mixes well with the full mouth feel, giving the beer a balanced bitterness. If it wasn't almost $6 a bottle I'd look forward to having this again! 928 charactersClevoPiwo, Aug 21, 2009

Surprisingly not as much of a coffee nose as I was expecting or hoping for maybe. A slight roast aroma with a very smooth malt fragrance.
Similar flavor to the smell, light coffee notes with and very light bitterness. Alcohol is hidden really well. 
Smooth mounthfeel while still being rather thick in consistency.
Overall I would say that I was pretty happy with the characteristics if this brew. Subtle/smooth flavors and smell with a 9.5% abv could get some of us in trouble 579 charactersZadok, Aug 20, 2009

Very dry nose with subtle coffee but not much else. Coffee flavors up front throughout and in the finish. Also very dry aspinlike finish.
Great mouthfeel and quite drinkable. Abit too dry in the finish to give higher marks for drinkabliity.

Full bodied without being viscous, rich with vigorous carbonation from the bottle conditioning. One sip definitely invites another and this beer was gone way too soon. A bit pricey, but no doubt one of the best impy stouts I've ever had. No description I can give will do this beer justice. 549 charactersMrHurmateeowish, Aug 18, 2009

If Péché Mortel is not a mortal sin, it should be. And I shall. This beer is so dark it should be spelled with six e's: Beee eeer! Péché Mortel is incredible, and worth the price. It pours black, but there is this cool magenta corona where the side of the glass, the bottom and the light meet. Try it. The aroma was coffee, with alcohol bringing up the rear, (caught ya, you counted the e's in beee eeer, didn't you). The taste was coffee with a little cocoa, powerful but not abusive. The feel was thick, decadent and oily as hell. Drinkability, not really, but at 9.5 ABV go ahead and have two (you pig). This beer is definitely underrated, come on BA's. God, would I love to try this on tap once before I die. 762 characterskegger22, Aug 17, 2009

Massive roasted malt aromas accompanied by deep, dark coffee, and chocolate, then reverting back to the toasty coffee.
Absolutely delicious coffee and chocolate malt flavors, tons of roasted character, and it always comes back to the coffee in the finish with just a touch of bitterness and smooth alcohol presence.
Very nice full bodied, and dense, medium carbonation, slightly chewy, and downright delicious.

not as strong of a coffee flavor as expected, but it is definitely there. taste is sweet and roasty up front, with a hop presence in the middle and sweet roasted coffee in the finish. the aftertaste is of STRONG bitter-sweet dark chocolate (like the aftertaste of 80% cocoa dark chocolate), which keeps you sipping for sure.

I can smell coffee without even sticking my nose in the glass! Needless to say the aroma is coffee grounds and the burnt smell of malts with the air of something slightly sweet.
The first sip is awesome. Huge coffee flavor and roasty malts followed by warming alcohol. There is also a bit of sweetness mixed at the end that is just slightly syrupy. As the beer warms, chocolate notes dance around the big coffee flavor and mellow out some of the bitterness. 
The mouthfeel is thick, feeling some of the coffee bitterness, which is then greeted by the warming of alcohol and some chocolaty malt. 
This beer is one of the best coffee stouts I have ever had, if not the best. Being a big coffee drinker I find this beer highly drinkable with the only knock on the drinkability being the strong alcohol presence. If 9.5% ABV is not your thing, then I would recommend Surly's Coffee Bender. Another great coffee beer that is more along the lines of a session beer. But in terms of imperial coffee stouts, Peche Mortel reigns supreme. 1,151 characterssisuspeed, Aug 11, 2009

Served in a pint glass. The head is delicate and brown butter-colored. As for the color, this is one of the blackest beers I have ever seen and completely opaque like you could eat it. It's sitting across the table under a lamp to appreciate this and I can smell the roasted coffee a few feet away. But not just any coffee smell: Rich, dark chocolate mocha made from the smoothest espresso! Time for noms.
A fine carbonation tickles the tongue at first sip, giving way to full-bodied fruity dark chocolate sweetness and effervescent alcohol with a lingering dark roast coffee aftertaste. Very smooth, warming and heavy on the taste without being heavy on the mouthfeel. The sweetness comes forward as I let it sit, but I can't seem to let it sit for very long...
This may be the best coffee I've ever had, let alone the best coffee stout. Yum yum. 960 charactersabuliarose, Aug 11, 2009

Smell: Strong coffee, sweet chocolate, strong roasted malt, and a nice smokey character. Small amount of alcohol in the nose, but that is expected with the ABV.
Taste: Starts out very sweet, sweet chocolate, coffee with cream and sugar. Then begins to turn more bitter, with a bittersweet chocolate and really strong roasted malt. Then some bittering hops, and a heavy but smooth smokey flavor giving it a very bitter taste. A small alcohol/astringent flavor pops up throughout. The after taste is strong of smoke and coffee. 
Mouthfeel: Very thick, syrupy, nice carbonation, good bitter tingle on the tongue and dry feel from the roasted malt. Leaves mouth with a filmy coating. Small alcohol burn. 
Overall: Okay drinkability, the flavors are really strong. Very sweet with a smooth transition to very bitter. A lot of smokey character especially in the flavor. Great beer but best kept for special occasions or when you just want to sit and savor a bunch of different flavors. 1,159 charactersnatasharai, Aug 10, 2009

S- Coffee and caramel with slight hint of alcohol
T- Complex and delicious. First thing to hit you is the strong coffee flavor. The next thing that strikes me is the creminess to it. Creaminess is comparable to a bell's double cream stout. After taste is of rich roasted malts. Roasted malt aftertaste lingers on the palate for quite a while. Slight caramel sweetness can be detected through complexity of other flavors. Taste is exceptional
M- nice balance of carbonation and viscosity. Mouthfeel really seems to click here. Carbonation Some nice lacing on the glass seems to be just right. 
D- Drinkability is very good because alcohol is very well hidden . However, to do this beer justice, you really have to sip it and really analyze all the different flavors that come together in this brew. 
Overall, an awesome stout that has a very complex flavor that is dominated by the coffee. Yum. 927 charactersaewinte1, Aug 08, 2009

S- The aroma is very dark and roasty with a lot of roasted coffee beans and some esters as well. 
T- The taste is straight up coffee. Péché Mortel without question packs the most coffee flavors in a beer that I have tried yet. The taste is dark roasted malts, loads of coffee and some booze in the finish.
M- The mouthfeel is a little underwhelming. It is lighter and a little under-carbonated compared to what I expect for a big stout such as this one. 
D- Overall, this is a world-class coffee stout without question. I think it is a little overrated and overhyped on here, but it is a fine beer that is definitely recommended! 709 characterscjgator3, Aug 04, 2009

A: Very dark brown, light tan head, about 1/4 inch thick, very dense bubbles and some big sticky clumps of lacing. Completely opaque, quite dark. Nice. 
S: Roasted coffee, chocolate, smells ashy, brown sugar, smells decent, but the coffee/burnt smells really overpower this one. 
T: Big time roasted coffee and the associated bitterness, really dominates all the other flavors, smokey and ashy as well, follows the nose quite well. Chocolate lingers deep in the flavor, citrus rind hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Definitely a coffee beer, somewhat sweet, but comes up a little short for me. Has a very pleasant aftertaste. 
M: Quite thin for the style, big time carbonation, sort of takes away from the beer, fairly warm alcohol in here as well. Somewhat sticky, but comes up a little short. 
D: Good dessert beer, but not the best ImpyStout that I've ever had. Still tasty, and I like the coffee, but a little more chocolate, molasses, etc...would have been nice. Definitely a beer for someone into coffee beers. May try again with a little age. Maybe a barrel aged version, that could be interesting. 1,160 characterspokesbeerdude, Aug 04, 2009

Right away I noticed this beer was syrupy thick dark black and very nicely laced.
As soon as this beer started coming out of the bottle I got these big pleasant whiffs of roasted coffee and esspresso. Underneath that there was some chocolate and vanilla to balance the roastiness with some sweeter notes.
Lots of great bitter and roasty characteristics here, coffee, chocolate dominate and complement each other very well. It had some alcohol spice to it, but was very full bodied and a joy to drinkn. 577 charactersmikey711, Jul 29, 2009
4.58/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5At almost $6 per 11.5 oz. bottle, I was expecting a lot. Thankfully, this one delivered.
11.5 oz. bottle poured into Stone 12th Anniv. glass.
A: Very dark in color. Huge frothy brown head that sticks around surprisingly... most other stouts' heads thin out quickly. Great lacing.
S: Smells of strong bitter coffee, as it should. Hints of chocolate and roasty/burnt malt.
T: Tastes of strong espresso... burnt coffee. Slight alcohol burn. Reminds me alot of Espresso Oak Aged Yeti, which is of course a good thing. There is a bit of a smoky presence as well, but definitely not overwhelming, just enough. Thank fuck, because fuck knows I don't like smoky beers. Pleasant roasty aftertaste.
M/D: Very full bodied, as expected from a stout. The alcohol isn't as powerful as I thought it would be, making this one pretty drinkable... if you've got a fortune to spend. 868 charactersTheViolator666, Jul 28, 2009
3.1/5  rDev -29.5%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Two quick caveats prior to my review of this beer. 1.) Not a huge fan of stouts, 2.) Really can't stand the taste of coffee. That being said I still had to give this a try as this is one of Dieu Du Ciel's most popular brews. 
A - Pours a super thick brown, almost black. I was surprised that there was almost no hint of carbonation when I poured this out of the bottle.
S - The scent of the coffee beans is overpowering. Almost as if they are burnt. The scent of coffee is not unpleasing to me but this is almost too much. None the less I drank the entire bottle so that my review would be fair and balanced.
T - Not being a coffee drinker, I imagine that this is what a stout infused with Espresso (or some other extremely strong coffee) would taste like. I suppose if I was a fan of Coffee it would probably be a little better but this just doesn't do it for me.
D - Even with all my apprehensions I finished the bottle. They can't all be winners. The beer is clearly well made (as are all Dieu Du Ciel beers that I have tried) 
M - Solid content to the beer, the lack of carbonation made it feel a little flat but it was still drinkable.
I stuck it out and gave it my best but I'm glad that I only purchased a single bottle. Not my cup of tea, but based on the scores here it apparently is enjoyed by most. 1,311 characterstdawgydog, Jul 28, 2009
4.87/5  rDev +10.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5First of all, twist off top? What the....
Pours a coffee black with a frothy light brown head, Belgainesque in size and consistency. The foam is creamy and thick, and leaves impressive lacing. This looks like super intensely frothy coffee, and I like.
The nose is pure, straight forward coffee beans. Surprisingly, however, I get a lot of chocolate. I'm not sure if it's actual chocolate or just some really good smelling chocolate malt, but I definitely get chocolate. Lots of coffee and lots of chocolate, and thats about it. A very light bitterness, but that might just be from the intense coffee smell. This is going to be good...
Whew! If this isn't a coffee bomb, I don't know what is. Honestly, this blurs the line of coffee beers, because this might be more coffee than beer! I don't care though, this is some great stuff! I get chocolate malts and coffee, and a slight roasted character that is very faint.
Mouthfeel is very rich and creamy, smooth and delicate. There is a slight bite from the alcohol, but nothing intrusive. Drinkability is very high, this might be the first big stout I could chug until the cows come home.
Completely deserving of the scores this beer receives. I'm very impressed with this Canadian brewery's brewering skills. Highly recommended. 1,281 charactersMistofminn, Jul 28, 2009

4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to jdmek9, as per usual. Enjoyed in a sniffer. 
A: About two fingers creamy dark tan head over a solid jet black brew. Absolutely no light pulling through here. A sizeable layer of head retention. 
S: Fresh roasted coffee beans out of the pour. I get dark fruits, mostly currant and ripe fig. The alcohol is in there but it's hidden well behind some dark chocolate. 
T: thick foam greets you and introduces the intense coffee bean that is both roasted and acidic, as coffee should be. The coffee is intense for a moment, but not do overpowering so as to think I'm drinking a straight shot of cold espresso. The heat on this beer is mild--I sense it, but it again seems to linger alongside some dark chocolate. This brew is wonderfully layered. 
M: big, creamy mouthfeel, low carbonation, and the viscosity assures that I'll enjoy great bittersweet chocolate residuals. 
D: this is a brilliant stout. I look forward to enjoying another. 943 characterswashburnkid, Jul 27, 2009
4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A- On the pour you can see this beer has a rich brown hue. Once its in my snifter, however, no light is passing through its blackness. 
Fairly typical imperial stout appearance. Black body, coffee colored head that reduces to a ring around the edge. This one has a thin pillow of foam that stays floating in the center.
S- Straight up coffee/espresso. Some chocolate and roastiness behind the powerful espresso beans. Swirling brings out some bourbony alcohol aromas.
T- Lots more espresso. Intense. Theres a milky smoothness to the taste which is a perfect partner to the espresso. Its very well balanced between bitter roasted espresso and a creamy sweetness. These two flavors/sensations take turns pummeling the tongue. Alcohol is present on the finish which drys it out a lot. 
M- Thick, smooth and well rounded. It slides through the mouth like liquid velvet. Its a very nice mouthfeel. 
D- This is an intense beer. Alcohol is hidden fairly well but the powerful espresso awesomeness makes no effort in subtlety. 1,022 charactersMbpBugeye, Jul 27, 2009
4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - Pitch black in a snifter with a... well.. coffee-with-a-single-creamer colored thin head. Lets no light through. 
S - Rich roasted coffee, malts, and dark chocolate. Roastiness comes through as mostly bitter, with a very slight sweetness. 
T - Roasted doffee beans up front, huge dark chocolate flavor on the back. Rich all the way through. This is absolutely delicious. The flavors are profoundly full and potent. 
M - Pleasant, mildly frothy. Mouthfeel kindof gets pushed to the backburner when tasting this beer. It just doesn't make itself known in any way. Isn't slick, isn't watery. 
D - Definately a sipper. The flavors are so big and the alcohol is high. It's so delicious to drink though. 705 charactersMunchkinDrinker, Jul 26, 2009
4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Brought this on a trip to visit kels to keep our BA top 100 streak alive and kicking. Poured from the bottle into a tulip.
Appearance: Pours near black and the body is entirely opaque - not a chance of light sneaking through on this one; comes with a short one finger deep tan head that fades very quickly to a an incomplete and uneven skim and a thick ring around the surface; the body is too dark to tell if there is any carbonation; there is a loose foamy lacing that attempts to hold to the sides of the glass but falls back into the beer very quickly.
Smell: The smell is exceptional - a combination of rich dark and milk chocolate, some oaky vanilla, espresso beans and a rich creaminess. 
Taste: Very much like the smell - all of those rich, dark and milky chocolatey flavors combined with some vanilla and a ton of espresso and coffee; definite presence of alcohol but it's combined so well with the other strong flavors that it doesn't overpower in the flavor, but does have a pretty strong presence in the feel.
Mouthfeel: The body is smooth, velvety, rich and creamy; there's a bit of sediment left on the teeth; the alcohol definitely warms the mouth and makes the gums especially dry an tingly; throat, chest and belly are warmed as well.
Drinkability: While the flavors, mouthfeel and smell are all amazing, the alcohol definitely hurts its ability to much more drinkable than just above average. I am definitely loving this beer though and I will likely pick up another and let it sit for a while to see if it cools down any. 1,545 charactersbamadog, Jul 26, 2009
4.05/5  rDev -8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Thanks so much to bamadog for bringing this along on a visit. We are keeping our BA top 100 tastings alive. This review is on the bottle poured into a snifter. 
Appearance: Pours a super dark brown, almost black, with a 1 finger foam tan head. It is completely opaque - no visibility to speak of. The head fades fairly quickly to a weak and watery skim with good rings of matching lace that slide right back into the beer. 
Smell: Smell is really complex and nice. There are clear notes of coffee, sweetly caramel roasted malts and extremely hot alcohol. The alcohol almost presents a little too stringently, almost metallic. There are more subtle notes of cream and sweet vanilla. 
Taste/Mouthfeel: This is one serious beer. The coffee is a definite standout in the taste, but it can barely compete with the seriously strong alcohol. As it warms, the sweet malts start to creep out, and there's even a slight detection of the hops in the aftertaste - kind of like tart apples. The feel is slightly carbonated and couples with a little stickiness. There's a some dryness from the roasted malt in the aftertaste. 
Drinkability: Moderate at best. It is a very tasty beer, but a little overwhelming for sure. 1,209 characterskels, Jul 26, 2009
4.29/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A: Deep black with a dark mocha colored head that slowly falls, leaving a wall of thin lace all the way down. Retains well with a solid 1/6th inch of foam over the top.
S: Woah. Absolutely fantastic. It's got loads of coffee, yes, but there is still a lot here that screams "top notch stout." Dark chocolate, some currant, and a hint of licorice sweetness all contribute wonderfully. A great aroma.
T&M: Gobs of coffee--it really tastes like very dark iced coffee. Dark and roasted black malt and hints of dark chocolate add some complexity, but the finish is a tad bit harsh for my liking. Body is full and rich, a smooth feel with a zesty, fine-bubbled carbonation from the bottle conditioning.
D: Rather drinkable for such a big stout. Nice coffee flavor, but it doesn't taste like coffee with a shot of beer added, which to me preserves its integrity as a beer. I think I may have let it warm a tad too much, because at close to room temperature it got a bit harsher. Keep this one in the 50-55 degree range and you're golden. Once it approaches 60-65, things get a bit harsh. 1,083 charactersBamaBeerBuff, Jul 25, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours a very thick black colour with an equally thick, dark roasty brown head that has ok retention and leaves some patchy lacing on the glass. Incredible coffee aromas waft from the beer with definite notes of chocolate and a roasty nuttiness that lets the drinker know this beer packs a flavour punch. Taste is deliciously roasted coffee-forward with rich dark chocolate undertones, subtle dark fruit and caramel (I get a bit of maple sugar in there too). Mouthfeel is very rich and ridiculously creamy, mouthcoating and smooth with a spicy, roasty kick on the finish and linger. This beer is very heavy. However, it does hide its high ABV very well, so the drinkability is actually quite impressive. Truly a work of art. This high mark is well deserved. 766 charactersGraham5161986, Jul 23, 2009

Appearance - pours like used motor oil
Smell - thick thick molasses and burnt coffee
Taste - pretty much the same as the taste, with an after taste of alchohol and coffee
Mouthfeel - THICK, like well molasses, taste stuck with me for awhile

Appearance - Black. Totally opaque. About an inch of nice mocha colored head with beautiful lacing. It looks fantastic. I can't imagine a much better looking Imperial Stout.
Smell - Banana bread? I'm as shocked as you are. But yes. Also some coffee cake. Followed by dark fruit, almost cherry, and some raisin as well. Definitely strong on the coffee, but not burnt. Smells pretty nice. 
Taste - Very mellow up front. Those dark fruits and cherry. Almost that banana thing. But then the coffee comes through. It has a nice roast to it, and it has a nice sweetness in the middle, but the finish is very bitter and really sticks around. Almost a burned coffee finish. 
Mouthfeel - Very nice and creamy. Good carbonation. Silky. Just laces the tongue. Very good.
Drinkability - Well, the burnt coffee finish is harming this one. Although it gets some points for hiding that abv pretty well. One and done, thanks.
If I liked coffee, I'd love this beer. But, I don't like coffee, so the best I can do is appreciate it. Very interesting and well done. Not that it's off the list, I think I'll pass in the future. But you should give it a bid. 1,262 characterscallmescraps, Jul 21, 2009

Appearance: Jet black opaque. Soapy mocha-colored head rimming the glass. Not droplets but mild sheets of lacing around the top at points. 
Smell: It warms to huge burned espresso beans, mocha acrid black coffee bitterness. and some bittersweet chocolate mouse or chocolate cake aromas. Strong, balanced, and very nice. 
Taste: Initial acrid blackened espresso beans, roasted charred malt, and acidic bitterness, a bit of metallic bite, dark lingering fruit and big bitterness upon the finish, which is long and opens up the fruit, even though the bitterness dominates. 
Mouthfeel: Big and creamy and almost nicely chalky in a way with its fullness, without remaining cloying. 
Drinkability: On point. A very good RIS, especially for a coffee drinker, which I'm really not. It's a big one, but it's balanced and it's a pretty special package overall. I'll be interested to see how some of these age. 1,049 charactersasabreed, Jul 20, 2009

4.17/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to Smithflipper for sharing this with me.
A - Pours a very dark brown verging on black into a large wine glass with a centimetre or so of brown tinged off white head.
S - Did someone say coffee? As to be expected quite a strong roasted coffee aroma dominates the smell. There is also some sweet chocolate along with a bit of a dark fruit character and some alcohol hints.
T - Again roasted coffee dominates the taste with some burnt bitterness coming through to balance the sweetish malt.
M - Medium to full bodied with minimal carbonation.
D - Obviously not a sessioner but I'd read a lot about this beer and brewery and it lived up to expectations. Would love to have this again. 688 charactersbrendan13, Jul 14, 2009

Pours thick & black with a finger-thick tan head, like most imperial stouts look. No lacing. Dense.
Sharp, dark roast smell with some notable chocolate & just a hint of dark fruit.
The taste: KAPOW! Dark roasted espresso with rum in it. That's how I'd describe this dish. Woody, roasted, nearly burnt, bitter chocolaty, plum skin, and tantamount to sucking on a bean. Are there grounds in my glass? A sweetness becomes more palpable as the beer warms, gets a little milky. Nice.
Full mouthfeel, a little prickly, warm from the booze. I'm not sure if coffee has tannins in it, but I'm getting a drying feeling. 
The taste is great, but this is definitely a sipper. Due to that drying sensation, I'm not sure this is a repeat performer -- rather, I'd savor the one I had & either move onto something lighter or call it a night. Definitely a good showing. 926 charactersOneDropSoup, Jul 11, 2009

4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3Thanks to kkulacki for 12oz bottle! Color on pouring into a pint glass is dark, but with tones of brown as well, so it's not totally black. The head is cream-colored and with a fantastic amount of lacing. Taking a whiff of this thing, you can start to smell the coffee...and some alcohol from a few inches away. Closer sniff is all coffee/espresso and roast. On to the taste. The first hit is all coffee. Very strong coffee...then as it moves to the back of the palate, more of the bitter chocolate tones come through. There's definitely a taste of alcohol and it's very bitter on the finish, but not overwhelming. As far as drinkability, I'd probably only have one or two - it's definitely good, but a strong one and quite bitter and heavy. 741 characterskdoc8, Jul 05, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Is it okay to celebrate with a mortal sin? Purchased this on my 50th birthday and consumed a few weeks later on the birth of my first grandchild. Here's to you QRM and to a long and happy life. May you enjoy and partake of the abundant riches this earth and life has to offer.
Aroma is fresh roast coffee, both freshly brewed and newly ground. Pleasing and consistent. Not overpowering but potent enough to cover other aroma's. 
Initially pours with not a particularly thick or heavy body, but quite black with a translucent almost brownish hue through the pour. One finger dark brown head that rather quickly moves to a dark ring. It's difficult to pick up any light through this elixir.
The blending on this is so nice. Coffee presents first, last and in-between, but not exclusively. Touch of dark berry and sweetness. An almost fruity tartness. A stout like sourness, resembling a dry stout. Malty dryness. Tasty bitterness. The flavors push intensity to sharpness without ever crossing the line. Alcohol is approachable adding taste, warmth and lightness to the consumer. Gets even better as it warms, and I started off only cool.
This is carbonated so perfectly. Abundant, yet light and fulfilling. Adds to the creaminess of the feel. Moderate body, yet drinks heavier than that at times without excess, or denying the experience of wanting more. The feel enhances the drinkability significantly. 
This bottle drinks like it's relatively new. It seems fresh, but not green. Maybe I should have picked up two. The alcohol content is what would slow me down, not the richness of the flavors. 
Funny, I don't feel sinful partaking. I feel relaxed, refreshed, blessed and happy.

Smells like some delicious espresso beans. Chocolate is floating around in there too. Great combo.
Taste follows the nose more or less, there's a fantastic espresso after taste. Some sweetness mellows this whole thing out. Fantastic
Has a nice chewy mouthfeel. Slides around smoothly.
Alcohol bite is minimal if even present. Makes this one great for summer evenings or a winter breakfast. 510 charactersyoungblood, Jul 02, 2009

S: there is almost a rich chocolate coffee cake that oozes with moisture but with the kind of aroma that sets your inner cheek to salivate knowing that an impending bitter shot was about to hit your mouth
T: no bitter shot ever materializes however, and the drink is extremely smooth. you do have a drying on the tongue from the coffee espresso type tones but the bitterness is cut by chocolate malt not unlike powdered coco none of these rather staunch flavors steel the show however, resulting in a very well balanced beer.
i would not rate this as a boom in your face extreme style beer like a a big RIS, and i think it fits itself well with where and what it is trying to be. the alc is high, but you wont notice 960 charactersRedwood21, Jul 02, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4As imperial stouts become more commonplace (yet still kicking major butt), I've toned down my body description from "black as night," "used motor oil," and "onyx-like," to simply, "damn, this thing is black!"
And indeed it is. No light gets through this puppy; even along the edges. Is there any other liquid that we imbibe that's as black as a Russian Imperial Stout? Maybe espresso, I suppose. Hmmmm, I'll think about that for a while.
In any event, this thing is black! With a tan, creamy head that settles down into a polka-dot pattern on the top of the brew.
Smell is a deep chocolate/liquirace/coffee scent that an entrepreneurial air freshiner lad should bottle up and sell.
Taste is very nice. A tthree-phased attack on the tongue. First is the malty sweetness with hints of chocolate. Second comes the dryness of the coffee, and last comes the warmth of the alcohol. This is nicely done and all three parts of the taste flow together nicely.
Mouthfeel is rather heavy in body, but the tiny effervescent bubbles lighten things up on the tongue.
Drinkability is great; pretty much all you'd want out of a 10% RIS. I'm impressed. 1,141 charactersDaveFL1976, Jul 02, 2009
4.9/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5This black bodied beer has a dense and tightly packed dark brown head resting on top. The retention and lace qualities are very, very good. The nose consists of nuts, cocoa, dark berries, rum, anise oil and heavily roasted coffee bean. Very thick aroma and very complex. Absolutely perfect. Heavy flavor too. I am very happy with this one. Dark roasted malts ride out the whole experience. Char and burnt malt give some bitterness. Blackberry and ainse oil intermingle nicely. Again, with some heavily roasted coffee flavor. Nice oily texture. Alcoholic presence is minimal and integrates nicely with the bold flavors. Body could use a boost, but that's a very minor "imperfection". Otherwise, we are dealing with an exceptional beer here in all facets of the game. 765 charactersBighuge, Jun 30, 2009
4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep black, entirely opaque with the exception of the very edge lining the short, light brown, creamy head. Ample wet lacing slowwwwly slides down the glass. Impressive and exactly what I'd expect from a world class coffee stout. 
Smell is of strong cold espresso and dark chocolate. Dry and aromatic. Nice.
Flavor follows suit. Much like Founders Breakfast Stout, lots of bitter espresso and high cacao dark chocolate. On the forefront, this is very lightly sweet--perfect in my eyes, but I can see people tasting this as too dry. Strongly bitter finish from heavily roasted, burnt malts. Very slightly boozy as it warms, but the alcohol is shockingly well hidden for 9.5%.
Tons of tiny bubbles are effervescent and tingly. Full bodied and creamy, this is rich and delicious. A fine way to relax at the end of the night. 
The dryness and general lack of detectability of alcohol makes this an incredibly drinkable coffee stout for its size.
Well, I no longer have a reason to trade for Founders Breakfast. At $9 bucks for a 12oz, it is very pricy, but then again, trading for 4 bottles at 10 bucks isn't cheap either. 
Great stuff. 1,146 charactersphotomike, Jun 29, 2009
4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Simply one of the best coffee stouts I've come across. Pours jet black with only a hint of dark mocha when held up to the light. Has only a faint mist of head pierced by slicks of the beer underneath. The smell is of freshly poured cappuccino with generous amounts of cocoa powder combined with a bit of brown sugar. Mouthfeel is silk smoothness; not as thick or syrupy as some impys can get. The taste delivers on the strong preliminaries: pure mocha bliss. Just when you think that the bold espresso lead-in is going to be overwhelming, the sweetness of creme brulee (and a bit of banana bread) comes in to provide a bit of restraint. The sweetness then fades, leaving a lingering coffee aftertaste that is strong but not overly charred. I'll try to cellar a couple of these, but I must say this tastes fantastic fresh, leaving very little room for improvement. Should pair quite well with medium dark chocolate, smoked ham and gouda. 936 characterschicagobeerriot, Jun 29, 2009
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured jet black, opaque, with dark brown edges. Fat, creamy tan head that sticks around and leaves a thick film of lace. Roasty coffee aroma, very strong. Some chocolate and vanilla, but dominated by the coffee. Viscous mouthfeel with a long, long finish. Powerful taste, possibly one of the strongest tasting stouts I've ever had. Bold roasted coffee and espressso throughout. Its laid on really heavy, like the blackest, most bitter coffee out there. The chocolate is not a reprieve. Dark and baker's variety. Just a bitter, bitter stout. Light vanilla and caramel flavors pop up periodically, as does a fuggels-like hop bite. Amazingly, this beer does the bitterness while avoiding the dreaded soy-sauce taste. The 9%+ is masked completely. Great beer. 756 charactersmagictrokini, Jun 26, 2009
4.12/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Reviewed with the help of wheatman106 and speedwayjim, served out of a pint glass.
Appearance- 3 1/2 finger of head, dark, opaque with beige brown head
Smell- This brew smells of roasted coffee, dark chocolate and there is a slight hint of hops profile.
Taste- Opens with a mellow dark chocolate. From the middle to the end of this brew, the coffee really comes out but as it nears the end the hop profile increases but is not overwhelming.
Mouthfeel- Medium to full bodied, nice and smooth. There is not carbonation in the beginning but the carbonation increases from the middle to the end which influence the coffee and hop characteristics. 
Drinkability- This brew is definitely one which I would have again. 716 characterscapra12, Jun 26, 2009

S- Very malty with some tones of coffee, can't pick up a single trace of hops.
T- Slightly sweet but it's countered by a heavy malt coffee bitterness, the sweetness and the bitterness sorta blend beautifully together. 
M- Feels great on the palate, creamy and very rich.
D- Wonderful, this stout caught me by surprise so much intense flavors hitting you all at once but in the end it all works out wonderfully. Thick, creamy, robust, malty, and just a pinch of sweetness makes this stout exceptional! 551 charactersMayhem976, Jun 23, 2009

4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.511.5 oz bottle into nonic.
Pitch black with very little light getting through. A one finger light brown head slowly settles to an even thin cap, leaving behind plenty of sticky lacing.
Tons of coffee in the aroma, along with roasted malts, and a bit of dark fruit. 
On top of the aroma, the flavor seems to have a slight smokiness to it, along with dark coffee and sharp burnt malts. Fulll bodied, thick, chewy. An overall creaminess is detectable throughout. 
An extremely rich coffee stout, without being too rich with overpowering sweetness. Very enjoyable. Recommended. 577 charactersBeerSox, Jun 22, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A big thank you to JoeMayo for this in a trade.
Pours ink black, no light comes through, and a toffee colored inch head. Aroma is dark rich chocolates, prunes, and some coffee notes. Reminds me a little of chocolate dipped espresso beans. Very good marks here.
My first sip reveals the more of a pronounced coffee flavor than I expected. Some lactose sweetness too, perhaps. The chocolate flavor is here, though in smaller proportion. I hadn't realized this was a coffee beer apparently, until now. Although in looking at the bottle, I now see it reads " ...au cafe' ". I'm guessing that if I understood French, I'd learn a lot more about this delicious beer.
Full bodied mouthfeel, long finish, sweet and roasty bitter, and delicious. One of the better stouts I've had in a while, and a fantastic coffee beer as well. Will seek this out again. Cheers! 855 charactersdancinwillie, Jun 20, 2009

4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This beer came highly recommended, and it is always a pleasure to try a beer as highly rated as this one. RIS is a very popular style these days, and there are certainly many of them - this one, as advertised had a very heavy dose of coffee. It was a nice blend of sweetness and dry roastiness ("burned pizza crust").
Color was black. Body was viscous. Head was non-existent. Aroma was coffee-ish; dry, roast-y, and pretty bitter. Flavor was the same, but the dry-roastiness was balanced with some milk-stout sweetness. Mouthfeel was very slick, and pretty thick. Quite solid.
Highly recommended. I bought this bottle at Blacklick Liquor on Broad St. Probably not worth the $5.89 for a 12oz bottle I paid, but quite good nonetheless. 735 charactersBeerBelcher, Jun 20, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4330ml bottle, served in a trusty Delerium Tremens goblet
Served more or less at room temp
Pours with a typically rich thick crude oil blackness, not as opaque as other stouts and it has a bit more viscosity. Rich creamy leather tan head followed by acres of patchy lacing all over the inside of the glass
Smell, rich sweet esters tinged with tonnes of rich coffee and sticky caramel. Strong whiffs of good cognac and rum soaked raisins. A hint of turkish delight and rose water along with more rich espresso aromas, a hint of oily cigar smokiness and a touch of freshly baked bread
Taste, initially rich esters followed by a flood of silky smooth rich coffee beans. Warming alcohol also but a deceiving 9.5% abv, it drinks very well and smoothly. Rich toffee and caramel, some nice chalky dryness on the finish. 
A stunning big bold stout, on par with many I've had before however this has a stronger and more prevelant rich coffee bitterness 947 characterscypressbob, Jun 19, 2009

At first the coffee amora is a little over powering but once you get your mouth around it it is an amazing IMS. Could I have more of this fuck yes, will I have more of these fuck yes. I have had this on tap at the brewpub in the past but it took an impressive bottle at home for me tonight to rate this....and good night. 378 charactershoser, Jun 19, 2009
4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A- Pours a deep black, letting absolutely no light through, even around the edges. One finger head has decent retention, and leaves minimal lacing. Twist off bottle does not appear to be dated (number codes on side of label are not notched or marked at all.)
S- Coffee, (obviously), is quite prevalent, but is backed by a large amount of overripe dark stone fruits, black patent malt, and a touch of alcohol. Also smells fairly sweet. Very nice. 
F- The palate is overwhelmed by coffee flavors, that exist somewhere in the realm between a french press, dark roast, and an Italian espresso. Unfortunately, there also seems to be a bit of rancid coffee oils present as well... hidden, but they're there. Towards the middle more of the darker roasted malts come forward with an acrid bitterness that cuts the sweet coffee present up front. The finish lingers for minutes, and is quite nice.
M- Thick, full, creamy... perhaps just very slightly overcarbonated, but overall very nice.
D- Excellent again.... 9.5% is well hidden.
Overall, it is a pretty damn good coffee stout. That being said, I do feel this beer is far over hyped. The flavors are pronounced, and well balanced, and overall the beer is well crafted, but it just lacks a bit of depth and complexity... Perhaps they changed the recipe recently (my label does say that it is brewed with "fair-trade coffee") that is not indicated here on BA. 
In the end, I feel that the Hitachino Espresso Stout is in the same upper price range, and is every bit as good, if not significantly better. Again, this "Mortal Sin" is damn good, but just doesn't live up to the hype. 1,627 charactersphisig137, Jun 19, 2009

S-Coffee and a slight tar iness. Slight rubberyness. Not overly pleasant. 
T- Coffee up front. Very burnt. Huge bitterness from the grains and hops. No hop flavor. Slight alcohol. Much less rubber than the smell.
M-Pretty thick. Slight alcohol tongue numbing. Despite the big head, not much in the way of prickly carbonation. 
D-the body and alcohol would keep me from drinking too many of these. That rubber though... not sure what that is. Distracting. 524 charactersorganicbrewer, Jun 18, 2009
3.87/5  rDev -12%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5I have been looking forward to this beer for quite a while, and it is definitely a decent brew....maybe a bit overpriced, but if you are looking for a coffee kick, here's your beer.
The pour yields a midnight black oily brew with a thin head that fades like my hairline. Lacing is there, but not in a big way.
The smell and taste both make up for the lack of head, dominated by coffee. Straight dominated. There is some alcohol and dark chocolate hiding around in the background.
The mouthfeel could use a bit of beefing up, but the carbonation was right, good feel.
I couldn't drink more than a 12oz of this, I kind of struggled with that to be honest...very nice, just not my favorite. 691 charactersgrayburn, Jun 18, 2009
3.73/5  rDev -15.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5As expected, pour is thick gorgeous black crude. Sizable head of very dark chocolate mocha. Quite nice. Smell is all bittersweet chocolate, burnt coffee, and a touch of alcohol. Taste is much less hot than I anticipated, but there is a bitterness that I do not much care for, along with some char. The coffee is definately there, the dark chocolate too, but that sweetness has to contend a little bit too hard with the bitter burnt tastes for my liking. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, but not as smooth as say, Speedway or Ten Fidy. This is a sipper for me, and not a repeat purchase. The alcohol is in check, but the flavors are just too intense and aggressive for me. It is a good beer to be sure, but there are other impy stouts I prefer to this one. 751 charactersOnibubba, Jun 16, 2009

Opaque black with a thin tan head and sparse, wispy surface. Thin but sticky lace, a fair bit of sediment is left in the bottle. The aroma jumps right out of the glass with rich molasses, tree bark, cloves, dark chocolate, burnt coffee. Taste features a bit of hoppy astingency that is well under control, black coffee, bakers chocolate with an aftertaste that lingers; bitter notes, dry brazil nut texture and mouthfeel. Alcohol cleverly integrated, superbly handled. Dense, rich in the mouth, head easily regenerates. Wow. Very, very nice. I would not hesitate to stock my cellar with this at every opportunity. 716 charactersThatWineGuy, Jun 16, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into an oversized wine glass.
Small head, dissipates very quickly.
A dark brown color, can't see through it, with a very faint reddish circle around the rim when held in the light.
A strong presence of coffee/espresso and molasses aromas.
Taste reminds me slightly of Patron XO, but without the alcohol burn. Good espresso and molasses flavors.
A tasty find- I will be getting more to put down and try later in the year to see what aging does. Good out of the bottle as well. 487 charactersmontecristo2, Jun 15, 2009

Smells like coffee, bitter chocolate, caramel and a hint of hops. Tastes pretty much like it smells. Chocolate and coffe up front with a strong roasty finish. Alcohol content is covered extremely well. Incredibly smooth, perfectly carbed. I could drink a bunch of these easily! 404 charactersNewGeneric, Jun 14, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.511.5oz bottle poured into a shaped pint glass.
Péché Mortel poured black with a small tan head that quickly dissipated. There was a decent amount of lace in the beginning; however, the glass finished clear.
The smell and taste were wonderful, dominated by coffee flavors without the bitterness and a trace of dark, but again not bitter, chocolate. The feel was super creamy with nothing remotely unpleasant left on the tongue. The high alcohol content left warmth that perfectly complimented the creamy feel. 
Péché Mortel is the perfect after-dinner drink, but also enjoyable on a hot lazy afternoon. It was a great experience that would appeal to non-beer drinkers as well as beer advocates. Very very nice. 716 charactersMetalHopHead6, Jun 14, 2009
4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I typically shy away from imports as they lack the character and intensity that a lot of American craft brews have. This beer, on the other hand, is so full of flavor and complexity, that it may change my outlook on imports as a whole. Here is my review:
A: Pours a pitch black color. No light is going to penetrate this monster. Head was tan and small, which ultimately dissipated to a film over the beer. No lacing, which is a little dissapointing. 
S: Massive roasted coffee aroma. Smells better than freshly made coffee. Smells a little bittersweet. Hints of chocolate. This is awesome. 
T: Wow. This might be the best coffee stout I have ever tasted. Initially, all you get is a massive roasted coffee flavor. It is a little acidic. Then, once you get used to the strong coffee presence, other great flavors are buried beneath. Big, bittersweet chocolate flavors. More dark chocolate than milk chocolate. Lots of roasted malts. Very well rounded flavors that are very robust and intense. Best import I have ever tasted.
M: Very creamy and thick. This does coat the mouth very nicely. Super smooth and just delicious.
D: It is 9.5% ABV, which does hurt it a little. Other than that, this is so creamy and smooth and just a treat. A definite sipper. 
This is what it is about. Excellent beer. It is a little expensive at $5.50 a 11.5oz bottle, but it is worth every cent. It has got more complexity and body than Founders Breakfast Stout, so check this out if you like that brew. Highest recommendation. 1,512 charactersOldSchoolGamer, Jun 13, 2009

Recieved from a trade with bmanning and guzzle211. Both sent one bottle not sure which I drank, but thanks !!!!
Pours an extreme black color with a nice brown head. The head formation is just plain greatness. The head forms with ease and should be done slowly and at an angle with this brew. The head it's self is not just a foamy bubbles that will leave soon, it is a thick clumpy cloud of foam that amazes me. The fragrance was nice and the coffee was very prominant. Though it was lovely mellow coffee scent with a chocolate/mollasses undertone to it.
The taste for this Coffee Imperial is straight up Coffee, but it does not blow out your taste buds. The Coffee flavor is the dominant taste that is backed up by a Mollasses and Chocolate flavor. The three flavors for me felt well balanced with the Coffee in the front. This brew was very smooth and carbonation was perfect. This brew I think is the perfect example of a well hidden high alcohol percentage brew. After threw drink it's self the alcohol level still did not hit me and I left wanting to have more. Love this stout and will continue to drink more of it. 1,152 charactersBZero007, Jun 12, 2009
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4This one pours a deep, dark brown - near black - with a tan head and lacing. The aroma is awesome - it is definitely coffee dominated, with some brown sugar and light, raisin esters. The taste is very good - nicely balanced, with notes of coffee and milk chocolate. The alcohol shines through in the end with a little heat, and mild astringency. The body is a little thin as well. Overall, an enjoyable imperial stout, but I would like to see a little more body and a little less heat from the alcohol. 502 charactersDousedInStout, Jun 11, 2009
4.69/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured this 341ml bottle into an over-sized wine glass. 
Completely opaque but not quite black; more deep, dark brown. Nice change from the usual jet-black stout. Frothy mocha head dissipates to a thin layer after a couple minutes. Minimal lacing. 
Pungent minerals, espresso, sweet dark chocolate, dark roasted malt, sweet dark fruit and caramel. Some faint hops in the background. This couldn't really smell much better. 
Huge espresso flavour. Cocoa, roasted malt, nice hops on the finish. Tastes like a perfect balance of a good espresso and a great stout. The 9.5% ABV is nowhere to be found, aside from the buzz it produces. So smooth and tasty. This is a taste I can call up in my memory like it's actually in my mouth; it's that memorable. 
This is a little thinner that I'd like it to be; still nice but a little on the watery side. For my taste it would be improved by being a little thicker. Light carbonation. 
So drinkable. This beer is really intense so I wouldn't want to drink it too often or in too large a quantity but it's a beer I end up craving regularly. This is easily the best coffee stout I've tried and the standard by which I measure all others (until I find a better one, I suppose, but I'm still waiting...). 1,242 characterseat, Jun 10, 2009

I had actually wanted to get my hands on this for a while now, but couldn't seem to find it. So glad to see that someone could read my mind on wanting it!
I'm not going to waste a lot of time with this review, because it's the simplest one I've done...hands down! If you like coffee, and you like beer, then this is your perfect brew. To me, it's almost like an iced coffee without the ice. The alcohol is barely even present, and all you can taste is COFFEE, COFFEE, COFFEE, and MORE COFFEE! It's as if you are chewing on coffee beans. As you can tell, I like coffee. 801 charactersBitterPachyderm, Jun 08, 2009

The thin brown head didn't hang around for long at all. Aroma was of super strong coffee and chocolate. The flavor was totally dominated by super burnt malt and roasted coffee. I love coffee beer but i think the coffee flavor was taken too far. The feel was super velvety smooth. One bottle of this is all i would need due to the extreme coffeeness goin on here but its fairly drinkable as the alcohol is well hidden. 514 characterskbnooshay, Jun 08, 2009

s: fantastic coffee aroma - thick, rich espresso and light roast coffee, completely smooth and without any acrid burnt character whatsoever, backed with an underlying body of baker's chocolate and some caramel hidden behind all that roast, nuances of woody citrus imparted by the hops, almost smells dessert like - perhaps tiramisu - without the distracting sweetness, fantastic
m: carbonation is on the low side, and the body medium-full
t: vivid, fresh medium roast coffee upfront backed by a mostly dry cocoa and only a touch of raw sugars, turns all coffee towards the finish, with a building astringent roast effect, very nice - and the coffee presence is spot on - but something seems to be missing, perhaps a light kick of malt complexity would remedy this
d: exceptionally easy given the high abv, and a great coffee stout at that

4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5341ml bottle. The shelves of my local bottleshop (really there is only one in this burg) were recently invaded by the offerings of this microbrewery from la Belle Province. Due to the dear six-pack price (what, no Free Trade within our own freaking country?), I decided to forestall investigation of the other mixed packs, to finally have a go at this. What is it with the Quebecois brewers and their predilection with the Christian afterworld? Oh, right.
This beer pours a total and complete black hole, destroyer of light, nothing from the Crayola spectrum even permissible at the edges, with three fingers of vigorous, thick, and yet frothy tan head, which leaves a broad array of chunky and sudsy lacing around the glass as it slowly recedes. 
It smells strongly, in no uncertain terms, of your local Italian coffee shop's espresso, bittersweet dark chocolate, roasted caramel malt, a twinge of boozy vanilla, some mild anise-heavy ouzo notes, and musty, leafy, and earthy hops. The taste is bitter espresso up front, once again, hefty chocolate malt dutifully following up, and instantly coating the palate, and then slowly dropping away to reveal some soft, dry black licorice, and nicely pedestrian earthy, and kind of dusty hops. A skulking, yet benevolently restrained booze warming hangs about, poking its nose in here and there.
The carbonation is very mild, the body a stately Rubenesque form, with an attendant creamy smoothness, one hardly even surmountable by the swirling booze notes. It finishes rather softly, really, with a slightly adult, fruity-chocolate holiday treat essence. 
A lovely, let you down easy imbiber, in the sense that it makes you forget the initial full-frontal, and maybe overbearing flavour assault, so that you immediately plunge in for another go-round, and...repeat, until you're surprised the glass is empty, and the booze you didn't notice at all before decides to fully join the party. Worthy of its rep, and probably a lot more. Mon dieu, et d'habitude, je n'aime pas même de café! 2,034 charactersbiboergosum, Jun 06, 2009
3.65/5  rDev -17%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Served in my Great Lakes snifter. 
This beer pours a medium black that is brown around the edges where light is creeping in. A one finger head and nice consistent lacing. As the glass gets less and less full I can see some sediment at the bottom, which I assume is coffee grounds.
The nose is strong and slightly astringent/alcoholic. Smells mostly of coffee and grapes. Taste is heavy on the dark coffee, and quite bitter. This beer leaves that thick bitter aftertaste that seems to last forever. 
Mouthfeel is slick and coating yet amply carbonated. Drinkability for me is relatively low due to the density of the coffee flavor, overpowering bitterness, and especially the boozy smell. 
This is a good beer, but I'm afraid that I'm in the minority who will not regularly seek out it out. For me it was just too one-dimensional on the coffee end. I'd much rather hit up some Founders Breakfast Stout if I am in the mood for an espresso beer. 946 charactersAVDeuph, Jun 03, 2009
4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This beer pours an opaque black, with a half finger of tan head that recedes to a 1/3 inch film that remains the whole way down. Nice wispy lacing left on the glass. Nose is strong coffee, almost espresso-like in nature. There is a touch of dark chocolate, and the alcohol is very much present in the nose. The taste is very boozy up front but as the beer warms it subsides and is virtually undetectable. Deep roasted malts, with espresso flavoring hit the taste buds first. There is brown sugar, dark chocolate and a dry roastiness that borders on burnt. The finish has a light hop bitterness with some fruitiness that is perhaps slight black cherries. Fuller body, with decent carbonation, clean feel with a dryer finish. This is a great beer to sit with, a lower AVB would make it a way more sessionable beer but too good to want to put down! 845 charactersJayli, Jun 03, 2009

Flavour is dark sugars, black coffee, cocoa, toffee, dark fruity raisins and prunes, green apple, and a hint of vanilla and licorice. Magnificent soft, silky body is lightly carbonated and oh so smooth. Surprisingly not particularly boozy given the abv and aromas. Strong though, and warming. I see why this particular beer is so highly rated. Beautiful balance of coffee bean and rich dark beer. It's like a liquid coffee-bean-chocolate truffle. 574 charactersallergictomacros, Jun 03, 2009

4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Presentation: Poured from 12oz bottle into Duvel tulip.
A: Pours a deep brownish/black with perfect dark brown 2 finger head that sticks around a nice long while. Laces the glass extremely well, and looks almost perfect for the style.
S: Not a lot of complexity going on here, but what is there is very nice. Loads of semi-sweet chocolate chip morsels, deep espresso/dark coffee notes, some roastiness although at a minimum. Dominant on the chocolate as it warms.
T: Taste follows the nose, but even better than expected. As it's cold it's actually more bitter than I prefer, but as it warms to room temperature there is a lot of complexity here. Dark chocolate notes meld with cocoa nibs, the fair trade coffee as mentioned on the label is prominent and lingers on the palette in a nice way, and as it warms to room temperature the chocolate takes over and it is superbly balanced. I wish I'd drank the whole bottle at room temperature. Don't NOT do that with this beer. Had it been slightly creamier this could have been my favorite in the style.
M: Absolutely perfect. Nice and thick, oily, coats the mouth almost like none other, and a carbonation that is so intense it dances across the tongue. Perfection among this style.
D: As it warms it's ridiculously high. Cool the alcohol shows a bit and the bitterness takes off somewhat from its score.
A really amazing example of this style. Highly recommended for beer lovers, coffee geeks, or dark chocolate lovers equally. This might turn a non-beer drinker into one if served properly and at the right temperature. 1,573 charactersthirdeye11, Jun 02, 2009
4.64/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Pours a very dark, completely opaque black color with a small tan head that retains nicely and leaves a good bit of lacing.
Semi sweet aroma of chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee. Very pronounced aroma that pulls you in right from the start.
Taste immediately hits with the roasted malt and coffee notes. Some hints of vanilla begin to creep in along with a more nutty taste profile. Overall, coffee flavors are the most predominant but this is still extremely well balanced and never too sweet.
Mostly smooth mouthfeel.
Never would have guessed this was 9.5% just by tasting it. Very well masked and there was never much of an alcoholic burn that hindered the drinkability of this in any way. 698 charactersVengeance526, Jun 01, 2009

5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours an inky black with a luscious tan head.
The nose is roasted malt and coffee.
Wow. It's malty sweet and bitter and roasty and burnt cocoa and a little creamy all at the same time. Tremendous! Coffee and stout in perfect harmony with some nice warming alcohol at the end. Stunningly delicious and full flavored without going overboard. If you like your coffee black like I do you'll likely love this beer.
The mouthfeel isn't a thick as I was expecting but the carbonation level works for me, the aftertaste is wonderful and lasting. It's rich but not cloying.
It's an extremely drinkable beer but the abv is too high to allow for sessionability. Damn.
Update: I had this on tap at Dieu Du Ciel this weekend and it was a near-religious experience and it may well top my list as the absolute best beer brewed in Canada. Everything I liked enough to give it an A seemed heightened and the mouthfeel seemed much creamier so I knocked this up to full marks for everything. 977 charactersMeisterBurger, May 29, 2009
4.39/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Purchased at MassBev in Lawrence, KS in early March...
Appearance: Pours a very opaque blackish-brown with a caramel-brown colored head. No light comes through this beast. 2 fingers worth and it looks to stick around for a while. Glorious lacing down the entire length of the glass. I want to hang pictures of this sight in my cubicle at work to remind me of what awaits at home. 
Smell: The dark roasted malts hit your nose from across the room. I've never smelled a more aromatic stout than this one. Some nutty scents, some hints of espresso, a twinge or two of chocolate, an off-scent of vanilla, and coffee, coffee, coffee...
Taste: Chocolate sweetness right of the bat melds into a coffee and espresso combination ending with vanilla malt roundness as this sweet syrup begins its journey down your throat. This is yummy!
Mouthfeel: This is a very thick and creamy imperial stout. It lingers quite a while after on your tongue. This beer was built for sipping on a cool, rainy evening.
Drinkability: At 9.5% ABV, this beer is a sipping experience. Eminently drinkable. I really like this impy stout. Tis' a shame that this beer isn't more widely available. Well, might have to be convinced to take that trip to Canada after all... 1,240 charactersCOBeerBuff, May 28, 2009

S- Big earthy notes of heavily roasted malts and dark roasted espresso.
T- Roasted dark malts, Blackened espresso, smoke, light charcoal. Light background notes of dried plums or other dark fibrous fruit.
M- Medium body and medium to light carbonation. Could be more viscous for me.
D- This is a really nice coffee stout. I'm not sure it quite lived up to the hype but on the other hand it's kind of raw and just it is what it is which I like. 510 charactersUA8, May 26, 2009

S- Coffee, chocolate, with brown sugar and vanilla making a pleasant appearance.
T- Coffee, chocolate, vanilla, with some general dark maltiness, and a bittersweet coffee finish.
M- Appropriate mouthfeel for a big stout.
D- Pretty good, I find coffee stouts to be slightly less quaffable than their non coffee counterparts.
Overall, slightly better than the breakfast stout, but not as good as the kentucky breakfast stout. A good beer that is easy to get a hold of, though a bit pricey. 551 charactersTK5150, May 25, 2009
4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Heard a lot of good things about this beer, so at my latest beer stop I saw a bottle sitting all by itself and I decided to rescue it...
Appearance: Pours a very dark brown with a small amount of head that fades quickly and leaves behind some nice lacing.
Smell: Coffee, chocolate, sweet goodness.
Taste: Coffee is very well represented, but not overly dominating. A nice chocolaty sweetness smooths out the brew, giving the overall taste a very nice balance.
Mouthfeel: Creamy, smooth, goes down easy. 
Drinkability: Wow...this is a fantastic brew. Very smooth, easy to drink, with a nice chocolaty sweetness and the robustness of coffee. It is a bit thick, but that is one thing I have come to expect and enjoy about an Imperial Stout. This beer is very drinkable, and fairly high in ABV, so be careful. I will be keeping my eye out for this again. 855 characterskrisandajt, May 25, 2009
4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured out of a 341ml bottle into a tulip. Pitch black body with a thin layer of brown film. Silky lacing briefly permeates the glass with each sip. Appetizing look.
Smell is dark unsweetened chocolate, roasted malt, fresh ground coffee, black licorice, burnt toast, and alcohol. Malt-forward and chocolaty with some floral hop aromas.
Taste is espresso, roasted malt, and an almond-like nuttiness with black licorice and vanilla mid-palate. Dry bitter hops round out the aftertaste with some warming alcohol going down. 
Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, and full-bodied with spicy carbonation. A rich and velvety mouthfeel, almost leathery in texture. Very dry finish with soothing alcohol. 
Overall, I had high expectations for this beer and it did not disappoint. An excellent imperial stout - chewy, complex, and satisfying with massive coffee / espresso flavours. Well done, Dieu du Ciel. 893 characterscratez, May 22, 2009

A strong amount of coffee and sour bitterness. Has a watery texture with a medium to full body. A hearty full body. Arobust finish with a great lingering aftertaste. This is a solid good beer. 460 charactersBirdiebeagle, May 22, 2009
4.74/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4From a 341 ml bottle, poured into a glass mug.
Intense coffee aroma upon opening! The beer pours pitch black with a small head and leaves minimal lacing. The taste is suprisngly sweet up front, but the coffee hits soon afterwards. Bitter espresso finish. The beer hides it's alcohol well, but it is detectable. This beer is possibly to strong in taste and alcohol to be a session beer. One will do me for tonight, but I look forward to returning to this one.
I went on a coffee stout/porter kick a couple of years ago, but eventually got tired with the mediocre options available. This beer is excellent, however. For coffee lovers in Alberta, this is the one! The sweetness provides some balance, but the taste if you don't enjoy coffee, avoid. 746 charactersmanchester81, May 22, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Immediately after cracking the bottle, I got a big whiff of rich bitter coffee.  It looked awesome after being poured into the glass; pitch black body (honestly, light could not escape this) with a medium tan coloured head that gave off lots of coffee aromas and maybe a bit of alcohol. The beer tasted amazing.  Lots of espresso right upfront, then some alcohol warmth and a bit of sweetness from the malts.  Left with a pleasant bitter coffee aftertaste that forced me to keep sipping.  Only small sips though, the amount of flavour in every little gulp was incredible. Of the few I've tried, this is by far the best coffee stout I've had. 646 charactersnotdan, May 19, 2009
4.87/5  rDev +10.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A- Pours smoothly, resulting in a very dark, opaque brown body, with minimal visible carbonation, and a creamy light-brown head. Wonderful lacing and decent head retention for a 9.5% beer.
S- Mostly espresso beans, with nice hints of dark chocolate, and very roasty, almost tobacco-like undertones. Very impressive!
T- First, it kicks in with a powerful roasted coffee bean flavour, then follows into a sweet, chocolate-like and slightly bitter taste. Finally, the finish consists of lingering roastiness (again, almost tobacco-like). One can also taste some hops, but it may be quite a challenge with all of the powerful roasted coffee flavours. As you approach the end of the glass, the alcohol starts becoming more defined, but, still, it does not get in the way, as you will still fully enjoy this stout (if you're into stouts and coffee).
M- Very smooth. Medium-bodied, a bit like molasses. The alcohol content in the taste is disguised quite well, too, even though you do get a warm feeling from it. This stout coats your whole mouth, producing a wonderful sensation and a feeling of joy.
D- Moderation is key with this one. Although it drinks quite smooth, I would recommend against having more than one at once. 1,223 charactersNightINgale, May 18, 2009

A- Pours a rock solid dark black with a lasting, beautiful 2-finger tan head.Thick, but not that motor oil thickness seen w/ other stouts. Leaves behind moderate sugary lacing.
S- First smell that hits is a wonderful roasted bean coffee, followed by hints of chocolate and sweet caramel. One of the best smelling beers I have ever encountered.
T- Picks up where the smell left off. An overwhelming rush of flavor to your palate. Thick dark espresso with roasted malts, followed by a subtle, crisp bitterness on the tip of your tounge. The flavor literally sits in your mouth and at the back of your throat long after even a single drink. Alcohol is very present but not too dominant to cause a distraction.
M- Warm, creamy molasses feel that continues to warm, leaving me extremely happy. This beer coates the inside of your mouth and keeps doing the same all the way down. Carbonation is spot on, allowing you to focus on the flavor.
D- This is not a beer for the faint of heart. Sit down and enjoy this one with a friend and relax. I could definitely drink another, but 2 would be my stopping point. 1,181 charactersRbald42, May 15, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Mikereaser for including this in a BIF
Pours a huge 3 finger chocolate head. Pitch black body, no light penetrates it at all. Head retention is one of a kind. Looks like the top of a root beer float, very fluffy. Lacing is great, sticking all over the glass
Smell is heavy on burnt malt and roasted coffee. Also some vanilla is smelled. Alcohol and hops are very faint. Smells like the coffee aisle of a grocery store
Omg, this is amazing. Its like the chocolate malts from Ten Fidy were blended with the oatmeal from Fat Dog then topped off with some Espresso Yeti. Its then finished off with smoky burnt malts and slightly bitter hops. Alcohol is present and warms the throat, tastes like someone threw in half a shot of bourbon in here. This complements the strong flavors from the malt and coffee. Definitely not a beer for the meek
Mouth feel is also great. Slightly under carbonated but Just enough to keep the beer from being heavy. Body is rich and thick with a nice creamy head.
This is the best beer i've ever had. Drink ability is great. For such a strong, flavorful beer i could go through a couple in a session. Words cant really express the full greatness of this beer, do yourself a favor and get ahold of one ASAP! 1,245 charactersangelmonster, May 15, 2009

a - deep black. fair amounts of lace, medium head retention. 
s - charcoal, roasted coffee, and malts. 
t - a nice toasty roasty coffee thing with some alcohol, but much more roasted malt.
m - pretty good. fairly well balanced.
d - black coffee isn't really my thing, but a good beer is, and due to that fact i'd have this any time. probably not going to be for a session due to the high ABV, but i'd have a glass or two of this if i could get it again. 625 charactersradshoesbro, May 15, 2009

A-Pours a rich, deep black. On top sits a puffy tan head that shrinks into a wispy layer of head.
S- Reeks (in a good way) of coffee! Clean coffee aromas dominate the nose. Some cocoa and leathery aromas linger around.
T- Like the smell, clean coffee character is prevalent. A sugary, cocoa/chocolate flavor balances beautifully with the coffee.
M- The mouthfeel is sensual, smooth and seductive. Its richness too does not skip out. The coffee and slight alcohol are invigorating.
D- Very non-offensive on the palate and the stomach. But I'd still drink it slowly as to enjoy it best. 619 charactersajr24, May 14, 2009

Not quite the same color as others. Off brown with like a tinge of yellow or gold...just barely. Not very chunky, a bit weak
Coffee ground aroma, a bit weak, as were the cocoa and raisin. Seems a good variety of aromas, but didn't mix too well. 
A semi-sharp feel and taste of raisin-coffee. Expected a bit more smoothness, but no biggie. Complexity fell short. This is a solid beer. A good warming with the abv, and a nice bite in the back. Thought the coffee would be more prominent, but to me the shortcoming of it was good... 634 charactersMebuzzard, May 13, 2009

S- Sweetened coffee, and lots of it. This is also very smoky and massively roasty. Slightly one-dimensional, but enjoyable.
T- Very sweet coffee, smoke, and roasty. There is a bit of a cinnamon aspect to this as well.
M- Exceedingly smooth with a nice carbonation level. Between the massive roastiness and the alcohol, this is slightly numbing.
D- A big sipper and a little one dimensional. I am a big coffee fan, and this is one of the few coffee beers that actually lives up to its name. The richness knocks down the drinkability just a bit. 665 charactersgordavidson, May 12, 2009
4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Péché Mortel pours an inky black that doesn't allow a bit of light to pass through, opaque even when held up to the light. The small brown head fades at first but comes back to maintain a nice thin frothy layer on top of the beer. The aroma is a first sweet dark and roasted malt that quickly gives way to rich oily coffee. There is just a hint of damp, stale coffee as well. Like the aroma, the flavor leads with sweet chocolatey dark malt but it quickly gives way to strong dark coffee. The crystal sweetness comes through again in the finish, but rich coffee lingers in the finish. There is just enough bitterness from the coffee and hops combined but no hop flavor to speak of. The alcohol is hidden but the sweetness shows the beer's strength and makes it a sipper for sure. 781 charactersericj551, May 12, 2009
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had a bottle of this at Volo in Toronto (my new favourite beer destination, too bad I live three hours away from it!). In short: it's one hell of a beer, much in accordance with its sinful name.
It poured deep oily black with a slight latte-coloured head. An imprssive look, but not really spectacular... darker beers have a more understated look to them, which is fine by me. The smell is of roasted whole coffee beans... not pungent like leaning into a bag of freshly bought beans and taking a big whiff, but more like the musty bottom of the bag after it's been used up. There's a sharpness to it, especially as alcohol aromas float up and mix with the coffee.
The flavour... wow, what a flavour. It's intense. Not like the mellow flavours of chocolate stouts or the slightly metallic fullness of an oatmeal stout, but a serious, no-nonsense crack across the tastebuds. There's an initial zing of brown sugar and light hops, then the dark, bitter kick of a fresh shot of good Italian espresso. It's a really unique flavour that has to be experienced, the bitterness of espresso mixed with the smoothness of a stout. The alcohol emerges and provides a comforting burn later on that mixes with the coffee tang and balances it out, lingering on in the mouth. I love good coffee, so this was just heavenly.
The beer is medium-bodied with a bit of slickness in the mouth that makes it feel lighter than a typical stout. It's made for smooth, relaxed sipping as the coffee flavours and the alcohol come together powerfully in each mouthful. I find it hard to describe... the best things about coffee (flavours) combining with the best things about beer (mouthfeel).
Not quaffingly drinkable, but it shouldn't have to be. Every sip is dramatic and very enjoyable. 1,763 charactersstrangemusic, May 11, 2009
2.42/5  rDev -45%look: 4 | smell: 2 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 211.5oz bottle. Black with a medium tan head that settles to a sparse foam slick. Slightly burnt green vegetal coffee aroma. It's a bit harsh to start but after thirty minutes or so, it mellows into a simply sweet and stale coffee aroma. A bit sweet on the tongue, but with an over-roasted and vegetal coffee character, that ends on an alcoholic and slightly burnt bitterness. Syrupy but also a little thin. I don't get this one. tastes like they burnt the coffee beans and then let the coffee sit out overnight before adding it to the beer. Honestly hard to finish this one. 574 charactersbulletrain76, May 11, 2009
4.28/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This beer pour so thick and syrupy, I thought it was dirty motor oil. A nice inch-sized tan head forms on the pour and this retains fairly decent. Some decent lacing sip rings paired with some other sticky globs make this a beautiful beer. Smells of stale coffee, cocoa, burnt sugar, and molasses. 
Mouthfeel is a little overly carbonated right off the bat, but as the beer warms this gives way to a smooth creaminess. Huge coffee bitterness all over the mouth on this one! An Imperial Coffee Stout this one is. This melds beautifully with the toasted chocolate that is also present. This is a heavy, heavy beer, so drinkability is not the highest. I honestly couldn't have more than one in a sitting. But drinking that 'one' is one of the more pleasurable experiences of my beer-life. Excellent beer. 802 charactersOnenote81, May 11, 2009
4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - A fairly hard pour gets me about two fingers of light brown dense head that barely seems to shrink. The black liquid allows no light to get through. A thick coating of lace is left on the sides of the pint glass as the beer is savored.
S - From pour until the glass is empty, there is no way to not smell the rich dark roast of coffee. There is also a hint of smoke when the scent is more closely examined.
T - The coffee is dark and rich with a sharp bitter aftertaste that contrasts the rather creamy upfront flavors the coffee first shows. The high alcohol doesn't show up until the liquid is swallowed and still feels subtle. while building up. The smokeness now makes me think of char that one might find on BBQ meats.
M - The beer coats the mouth, tongue, and throat. The alcohol slowly warms the back of the troat and lingers for sometime. while the coffee tastes a very dark roast, the creaminess seems to off set it just enough.
D - I think a coffee drinker (which I must admit - I am not) will really like this beer. For me, the creamy texture and toasted malts work really well to give a strong flavor but not so much an overpowering presence. The high alcohol that slowly builds in fire help to allow one to try this beer possibly to have more the one. Good after dinner drink. 1,297 charactersJMBSH, May 11, 2009
4.03/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Pours a deep black with a generous amount of thick brown head. Head is long lasting and leaves a huge amount of lacing down the glass. Smell is big and bold, lots of earthy roasted coffee scents with maybe a bit of chocolate underlining it. Taste is also big on coffee flavor. The thought of drinking a batch of chocolate flavored coffee beans comes to mind. A dull bitterness finishes it off, leaving a coffee aftertaste in the mouth.
For the style it's great. For me... well I am not much of a coffee fan, so the bold coffee flavors are a bit of a turn off, hampering drinkability. 584 charactersSeanstoppable, May 09, 2009

A - Poured a deep black body with ruby highlights, sparse amount of carbonation, and a slim tan head that reduced to a thin ring and patchy film.
S - Mmmm... smells of freshly ground iced coffee with hints of baker's chocolate or chocolate cake as well as some earthy, woody hops. Aroma is simply amazing!
T - Flavor is dominated by a pronounced, lingering coffee and chocolate flavor paired with some woody notes reminiscent of tree bark. Earthy, charred bitterness comprises the finish.
M - Medium to full bodied with an oily texture and moderate carbonation. Astringent with a lingering bitter finish on the palate.
D - Stunningly delicious coffee stout that is definitely worthy of all the hype and acclaim. This is simply an outstanding, world class coffee stout to say the least. 857 charactersffejherb, May 09, 2009
4.51/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A thoughtful treat included by wfeddern during the recent CanBIF 5, much appreciated.
From a 341 ml brown bottle, pours out a dense, dense opaque black, no hint of permeable light, not even any hint of a lighter nimbus along the extremities. Tall frothy tan head that slowly recedes, mottled lashes of thick sticky lacing.
Intense vinuous roasted malt, milky bitter espresso notes, earthy yet not dry.
Um, first off one of the most enjoyably drinkable Imperial Stouts I've tried, even with the added coffee profile. Flavour is bold yet contained, roasted malt up front is slightly bitter, combined with coffee notes, yet smooth in the middle and into the finish. A bit of a roasted kick on the finish, yet still contained and melds into the overall flavour trip. Only in the aftertaste does a dry powdery bitterness tend to head off the beaten path. The flavour is really like being in a wave pool full of this stuff, gently rolling over the palate and perpetually enjoyable, but controlled enough that nothing comes crashing down over your head to break the chain. Really, it's not an overly complex flavour profile, but well crafted with no seams showing at all.
The mouthfeel is practically ideal for the style, on the fuller side of medium-bodied, yet smooth and silky, not thin or vinuous. 
Pretty amazing, even the alcohol is masked so well I'd call this a fantastic session stout if I didn't know any better. Plus the coffee blends in so effortlessly with the roasted malts that if I didn't know about it in advance I'd say that it was all on the part of the malt. Very nice to come across an overhyped beer that finally lives up to its reputation. 1,660 charactersIronDjinn, May 08, 2009

A: Nice opaque black with thin dark tan head. With backlighting, I still don't get anything coming through.
S: Coffee (medium roast) with a hint of smoke and char. Very nice!
T: Very nice coffee...a true, representative flavor. The only knock (and this is a small one) is that it is a tad bitter (like the coffee at the end of the pot as opposed to the first cup). However, in re-reading the outside of the 6-pack box, it does state that this will have a bitter note...fairly warned. Nice dark roasted malt, medium roast coffee, wood, smoke, and char. Simply wonderful.
M: Taste evolves and matures nicely. Fairly smooth with a bitter coffee bite.
D: An excellent brew that you want to take your time with in order to properly savor it. Definitely one of the best (if not the best) coffee beer I've come across. And as a coffee lover, I am picky about this. Highly recommended...seek this out! 971 charactersmwilbur, May 06, 2009

It has a strong roasted coffee aroma. It is full bodied and very smooth with a quick finish that kind of leaves the tongue in shock. It is well bittered and very roasty. There is a slight hint of sweetness, like molasses. It's well balanced and warming. It's not for chugging. It took be a couple hours to get through the glass. 465 charactersyesyouam, May 05, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured this big alcohol boy (9,5%) somewhat hard - and was rewarded with a nice thick ½ inch tan head floating on the black brew - just a sheet of lace ringing the glass.
Coffee chocolate milkshake in the aroma - even an aroma of chalky biscuit pops up.
Rich, dark chocolate and roasted coffee in the quaff - LOADED with thick malt. Biting hop finish quells any thought of an over sweet brew.
Definite tasty sipper - perfect cool weather brew like today with the temps in the 60s. Bit expensive with the import price for the 11.5 ounce brew, but very enjoyable nonetheless.
No hint of the big alcohol, sip with care. 621 charactersVancer, May 03, 2009
3.9/5  rDev -11.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Served in a Duvel glass from an 11.2oz bottle at my house
Pours jet black with a tan-brown head, looks just like KBS in the glass
The nose is almost all roasted coffee, a bit of chocoltae peeks through, but just a tiny bit
The roasted coffee dominates the flavor as well (no surprise here), the chocolate comes through a bit more in the taste. A few other flavors poke in and out, vanilla, a smoke note. 
Very rich and heavy, balanced by appropriate carbonation. This is an oily feel.
An exceptional beer, too much coffee roast for me to have more than 1 in a sitting but it is a great 1. 593 charactersmhatters, May 03, 2009
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is among the best beers I have tasted. The beer is dark with a decent espresso colored head. The smell and taste of coffee in this beer is unlike other coffee stouts I've had before - the taste is strong throughout and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. The mouthfeel is of moderate thickness, really perfect to complement the taste. I could certainly drink this one every night. 379 charactersdmad50, May 03, 2009
3.42/5  rDev -22.3%look: 5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Pours the blackest black with no light coming through. A hard pour gives a thick tan head that settles to about one inch. Aroma is burnt coffee. Taste: WOW that coffee hits you right up front and is a bit overwhelming. As the coffee finally settles down you get the alcohol warming through. All the senses are there to indicate this is a well-crafted beer; there is only one problem. I don't like coffee. Obviously this is not the beer's fault, and I was able to enjoy it anyway. But for anyone who does in fact like coffee, this is surely one of the better beers you'll come across. 583 characterscoachdonovan, May 01, 2009
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I got this beer months ago and have not opened it for whatever reason. I hope all the time in the fridge hasn't had a negative effect on it.
A- Certainly nothing wrong here. It's nearly black with a great tan head that rises about two inches to the top of the snifter and then slowly dissipates; but not too slowly, as it's receded enough to drink the beer in a couple minutes, leaving a few smatterings of lace along the sides of the glass. 
S- Tons of coffee, clearly more coffee aroma than would be in a normal stout. A touch of licorice, some chocolate, and a vague fruitiness round out the smell. Very good, although not much different from other coffee stouts.
T- Lots more coffee, more coffee flavor than I've ever had in a beer before, in fact. Lots of roasty, burnt flavors give it an almost smoky flavor, like something that was charcoal-grilled. There is a nice malty sweetness that backs all these flavors up and keeps them from overwhelming the palate. The finish is quite bitter, I'm guessing from all the coffee and roasted malt, although hops could be playing a part (although I can't really taste them).
M- Definitely full-bodied and a little syrupy but with a good amount of carbonation to balance out the richness.
D- Quite drinkable for a big beer, but it's not something I'd want too much of. The bitterness alone would limit one's ability to appreciate a second round, to make no mention of the richness and alcohol content. Still, for the style, it's quite good.
This is a great beer, plain and simple. I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I liked this beer a lot. Still, if you don't like coffee, you might want to stay away, as the coffee flavor in this beer is huge. If, however, you do like coffee, or are indifferent about coffee and just like good beer, then this beer is worth seeking out. Recommended. 1,836 charactersInsolublePancake, Apr 30, 2009

Poured into a pint glass at 51 degrees. 
Appearance: A jet black color, with a monster 2 finger head. The head is tan in color, foamy and creamy. The head slowly dissipated to give the eye some candy. The clarity of beer doesn't exist. . There is some lacing left on the glass as the head slowly dissipates. 
Nose: A very rich coffee, dark malt, roasted malt, chocolate with some molasses like sweetness. There are some floral esters, and some woody notes. There a some charcoal like aromas. 
Taste: A very rich roasted malt, some dark malt, very nice rich coffee, bittersweet dark chocolate and some woodiness. Further down the taste of the beer there is some floral ester, a touch of molasses sweetness, and a burnt character. 
Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated and sticky. The body of the beer is rich chewy and very thick. The finish of the beer is very nice and lingers pleasantly on the palate. I must say that this is a great beer. It has the depth, the richness, and full body flavor like a RIS. Now, this beer has a depth that needs to be further explored. As my mouth relished the wonderful taste that this beer presents on the palate, my taste buds are tingling with excitement and are rejoicing. I love this beer. I am going to round this up and say wow. The hype must live on. 1,361 characterscolts9016, Apr 30, 2009

Taste is amazing, a perfect mix of coffee and roasted malts with good chocolate undertones. Light medium mouthfeel. Great drinkability. Great beer but not quite on the level of Founders Breakfast Stout and Great Divide Espresso Oak Aged Yeti, which I believe are better especially for the price. I would definitely never turn down a bottle though. 460 charactersdakid618, Apr 29, 2009

Intense espresso coffee smells. Also roasted malts. A little toffee sweetness is in the background. Very good smell my mouth is already watering. 
Wow intense espresso coffee and dark chocolate flavors each hits with concurrent sips. Just a smooth creamy complexity to it. The toffee comes around in the end too which balances nicely the bite from the alcohol. 
Very creamy and smooth. A touch of the alcohol as it goes down. This beer an impressive blend of the chocolaty sweet stouts and the bitter complex coffee stouts. 635 charactersbfields4, Apr 28, 2009
4.54/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Well... right upon opening take a good sniff right out of the bottle, it smells DELICIOUS.. coffee and vanilla bean and some cocoa, amazing.. Pours a brownish/black, not totally opaque when you pour it (though it is in the glass) with very thin cream-colored head. Doesn't look like motor oil, unfortunately.. Tastes like cappucino, dark chocolate, etc.. not super strong flavor like KBS, though definitely very good. It does have an organic, natural quality to it. Bitter black coffee at end of the sip. Mouth isn't the most viscous thickness ever, but still very nice. Slightly chewy with prominent carbonation. Overall its pretty great, not too heavy so you can have more than one, but just short of perfect. 711 charactersBirdFlu, Apr 25, 2009

S: Coffee, really dominated by coffee and you can smell some alcohol heat
T: Roasted coffee is the best way to describe this. Lots of dark coffee flavor that lasts well after each sip with a nice roasty smokiness also. a bit of complexity too with some other smaller role playing sweetness flavors tossed in. good stuff!

4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5This poured an opaque black with dark tan head. It smelled like fresh coffee grinds and alcohol, with some roasted barley and licorice. It tasted like strong bitter coffee (fresh grinds, roasted beans, and burnt beverage), with potent alcohol and some licorice and charred oak. It became much richer and creamier as it warmed, and the alcohol notes subsided. It was oily with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste with some alcohol warming. Overall this was a very strong beer that's definitely meant for sipping. It had a very nice coffee flavor, but was nearly overwhelming. Alcohol was pervasive at first, but became much more subtle as I drank. Very nice body, too. I think age could help mellow this out, since it's pretty hot fresh. This is otherwise a great beer. 782 charactersPencible, Apr 24, 2009

A= This ale poured a super dark black-brown color with zero light penetation and a 2.5" dense tan head. The head took a LONG time to settle and eventually leveled out into a thin cap. Just a few spots of lace on the glass. 
S= The aroma of this one was dark roasted grains and coffee on top with a sweetness underneath. The alcohol was there but never overpowered the malts. 
T= The flavors in this stout were amazing. Like in the aroma, I found flavors of roasted grain, coffee, dark chocolate, and hints of treacle/toffee. Hand in hand with the roasty bitter notes came a rich underlying sweetness. No hop presence notable. The finish dried considerably and left a long pleasant aftertaste. Alcohol was well disquised throughout. 
MF= Semi-viscous chewy body with a moderate carbonation level and tongue-coating feel.
D= Wow this was an outstanding beer worthy of any hype it generates. I found it to be supremely drinkable and surprisingly the abv was not a factor at all. 1,157 charactersspointon, Apr 24, 2009

Smells of peat and coffee dominate; very earthy.
Taste is outstanding. A perfect balance of coffee and chocolate malt with neither being dominant or overly pronounced. This is superbly balanced. A pleasure to taste.
Feels smooth and creamy in the mouth with just enough carbonation to remind you that it is, in fact, a beer. The body is thick and just a little bit on the syrupy side.
Drinkability? I will have no trouble at all finishing this one but this is a one and done; a night-ender if there ever was one.
I will buy this one again and again as I see it in the store in singles for myself or one for every two people at a tasting. 759 charactersStrangeBrewer76, Apr 24, 2009

Perfect Imperial coffee stout, so well balanced, and drinkable. It is very easy to overdo one aspect or another of a beer like this, but it all played so well together - the malt, coffee, alcohol, and roastiness. 424 charactersokra, Apr 22, 2009
4.34/5  rDev -1.4%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a pint glass. 
5.0 A: Nearly completely black color. Fizzy, but dense 2 fingers of tan head. Incredible retention and lots of lacing. One hell of a good looking brew. 
3.5 S: Really pleasant coffee and chocolate aroma. Roasted barley next. Problem is that the aroma is really weak.
4.5 T: This certainly is a great brew and very unique. I can state with confidence that I could pick this out of a line of stouts I've had before. This is what I might expect if I went to a really nice coffee place and asked for something delicious. That said, nearly perfect roasted espresso with a touch of frothed up milk. Some smokiness and some bitter chocolate. Espresso taste lasts long after each sip. I'm shocked at how well hidden the alcohol is.
5.0 M: Medium heavy body. Very creamy and perfect carbonation. No problems at all.
4.5 D: I could drink the hell out of this. If it didn't have alcohol, I'd be downing these like crazy when finals period comes around. 973 charactersDavoleBomb, Apr 21, 2009

Poured into a Unibroue tulip glass. Canadian neighbor - how appropriate. 
2008 offering properly stored in my cellar. 
Massive, three-finger head that required a break in the pour. Foamy, light cocoa head that leaves lots of messy lacing and big pockets. Head subsides to 1/4 finger with impressive remnants. 
Color is black. Aroma is strong roasted coffee. For a beer with coffee as a subset of the name, this is what I would expect from the aroma. Some malt sweetness present in the initial aroma. 
First sip is full and rich. Very nice. Perhaps a tad too much carbonation. 
Halfway through and this one is delivering. I love the intense roasted coffee in both the aroma and the flavor. Thick mouthfeel and balanced sweetness make this a very nice beer. 
With this many ratings and this high of a score, it's not like I'm going out on a limb with a statement about how wonderful this beer is. 1,004 charactersYetiman420, Apr 21, 2009
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Pours a deep opaque brown/black into a snifter with a one finger tan head.
Nose is relatively mild. Smokey roasted coffee, chocolate, some vanilla and caramel. Bit of hot alcohol. There seems to be an interesting sweet bubble gum aroma sneaking in as it warms. Almost takes on some Belgian characteristics and starts to smell more like a Quad.
Mouthfeel is full bodied with medium carbonation, silky and smooth with a slightly dry finish. The amount of carbonation on this is pretty much perfect. Overall, mouthfeel is one of the better aspects of this beer - it's a pleasure to drink.
Taste is roasted barley, coffee, big chocolate near the end and some slight hoppy bitterness in the finish. The linger is mostly smokey semi-sweet chocolate. Some hot alcohol bite throughout. Nothing poking out over the top on this one - all well balanced.
The balance keeps the drinkability right up there with the best of imperial stouts.
Overall I have to say I was expecting more out of this one. It gets a lot of hype, but I'm having trouble pinpointing what about it would set it apart from other top-shelf imperial stouts. The balance is quite nice and it's highly enjoyable, just not as good as I was expecting. That said, this is still a fantastic stout which seems to really open up with some more complex flavors as it warms. 1,327 charactersfrothyhead, Apr 20, 2009

As soon as you pop the cap, the aroma of intense coffee hits the nose. Strong dark coffee and espresso smells -- not your everyday morning coffee. Have been really looking forward to this one and it is living up to the hype so far.
Pours very dark. No light to be seen through it at all. Surprisingly robust head on this one. Foams up a nice half / three quarter inch of dense dark khaki head.
The coffee is by far the most dominant flavor, but I wouldn't consider it a simple taste by any means. Lots of subtleties going on. Great aftertaste of strong coffee. Alcohol is hidden extremely well here.
Mouthfeel left a little to be desired for me. Slightly thin and lacked the viscosity you expect from a big stout. Still is was very smooth and drinkable. Extremely highly recommended if you enjoy coffee stouts -- Doesn't quite live up to FBS in my book, but a close second in class. 919 charactersBcaulin, Apr 19, 2009

S- smells just like my french press after its been sitting around and has cooled down, just before i wash it out. 
T- initially it is quite bitter and has predominant alcohol flavor but this fades into flavors of coffee with a perfect lingering bitterness. same aftertaste as my morning cup o' joe but with a little more bitterness. alcohol is quite apparent but not harsh or unwelcome. 
M- has medium-high but perfect carbonation. a little sweetness but finishes dry and bitter. i think this beer could use some more body and mouthfeel. thats what would give it my a+.
D- as far as imperial stout goes it is quite drinkable but not as drinkable as my favorite impy. 
this is a good beer and i can see why others rate it higher than i did. i am just comparing it to the best iv ever had. wont name it but you can see it in my reviews. also, i dont know what the rest of you pay for it, but since their in my home town i payed about 2.75 for 12 oz bottle which i consider an incredible value!

Pours thick, syrupy almost black. Tan head, decent but not amazing endurance on it. Not much lacing, but some nice carbonation bubbles. Smells very strongly of coffee, that's the overwhelming aura.
Taste is well worth the hype. An absolute coffee bomb, tastes like fresh coffee, without being too over the top about that aspect. The coffee flavor dominates, licorice and sweet cream sugar take a second. Not a lot of chocolate malt, the roastiness and coffee reign supreme, and are the lingering flavors thereafter. Just a hint of hops to help cut through all the gobbledegook. Nice and creamy, not the biggest, awesomest mouthfeel, but enough to carry the flavors forward. I don't like to give 5s easily for any aspect, this is right on the cusp, but the flavor is concentrated enough, yet carries enough else to it that it warrants it, barely. Drinkability is great for something of this magnitude. A little boozey on the throat after, but you hardly notice, since you're drowning in coffee awesome. I want more, nao. Top notch! 1,196 charactersdamienblack, Apr 18, 2009

I've just had my first Peché Mortel and I'll tell you this: it's not going to be my last, not by a long shot. Big, roasty flavours with complexity and balance, liveliness in the mouth (but not too much; think Unibroue on just a sweet little dose of valium), and a very more-ish drinking profile combine for a near-perfect brew. Best coffee stout I've had yet. A "mortal sin" worth perdition. 544 charactersstagger, Apr 16, 2009
4.63/5  rDev +5.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is one of my favorites, but I want to review it because I just had it for the first time in a while and it was a tasty treat.
Brutally dark, with a strong coffee aroma and almost looking like syrup, I poured this into a stemless wine glass and let it sit for a while with its dark tannish head as it warmed up to about room temperature. For me that's my favorite way to drink it.
Unmistakably coffee-like and dark, but still very drinkable, Peche is expensive but worth it for the small bottle. It alternatively tastes like burnt malts, strong coffee, creamy and almost milky, but it is all good. Oh I almost forgot the chocolate elements in there as well, bouncing off the coffee nicely.
Overall this might be my favorite beer if I had to pick one, but it's definitely in my top ten. If you're in the mood for a coffee/chocolate stout, this is the best bet if you can find it. Derishous. 896 charactersrasta16ry, Apr 15, 2009

Tastes like strong coffee stirred with milk chocolate along with a small dash of alcohol at the end. The finish on this beer is great...just like I finished a cup of freshly ground coffee or took a nice expresso shot after dinner. Mouthfeel is rich and think (but not too think for this beer) and I enjoy every sip. I will drink this beer again, no doubt. This is a great beer to end a wonderful dinner or just when you're looking for some expresso/coffee without drinking actual expresso/coffee. A must-try. 630 charactersSean9689, Apr 14, 2009

A: Pours pitch black with no hope of light seeping through. The head that is produced is tan and dissipates quickly, leaving no lacing along the glass. A sight of pure joy!
S: Coffee, burnt malts, raisins, dates, roasted espresso beans...HUGE espresso notes, which is quite a feat to conquer, that is to capture this note and put it into a beer
T: Burnt malts, fair trade coffee, espresso beans, I thought there would be dark fruit, but none here. A little smokey note at the finish. Again, no faults.
MF/D: Very chewy, full body, smooth going down, not bitter, not dry- just perfect!!
This is the best beer that I have ever had. If you like chewy, balanced, knock-your-socks-off flavor, seek this one out 842 charactersscottyshades, Apr 13, 2009
4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5A--Hard pour yields a wonderful two finger light brown head. This is opaque black, just how it should be. Lots of lacing down the glass too.
S--Mostly coffee in the nose, and a very good variety of coffee at that. Taking a huge whiff will definitely clear your sinuses and probably wake you up from a slumber. Actually, this smells almost identical to a black coffee from Starbucks.
T--Holy cow. Unexpected. I mean, I knew it was going to be a coffee bomb but there is a milky creaminess to this that makes me wonder if they threw a few cups of half & half in the batch as well. The taste itself is mostly coffee, and apparently a very good coffee at that because this tastes so fresh. Even Founders Breakfast Stout, which I love, tastes like 8 hour old coffee to me. This tastes fresh brewed.
M--That milky creaminess I referred to really shines here. Its not as thick as something like Bourbon County Stout or Speedway Stout, but it is in my opinion a perfect balance between rich cream and solid carbonation.
D--A bit too one dimensional to be extremely drinkable, but still very solid overall
If you like coffee stouts and haven't had this, you are missing out. 1,170 charactersalcstradamus, Apr 10, 2009
4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I picked this sucker up at MarCellars in Idaho Falls. It's in a bottle, but the date mark is not informative enough for me to be able to announce her age;) This Coffee Stout pours dark dark like motor oil, but not so thick; it's dark as night as a whole, but really thin, so when it's held up to a bright light, it's difficult to recognize how dark it is because it appears to be a darker nut brown. It hit my mouth with a rather lite/bubbly booze reinforced warm Imperial feel. The decent and rather thick head dissipated quickly to not hardly a trace being left on top and nearly no lacing either. Huh...odd I think, but hey...it's a double stout pushing the 10% mark, so I suppose that it should be expected. Quite frankly I'm a bit embarrassed to say that there's not enough coffee coming out in this one, rather a chocolaty alcohol. Most certainly belongs with the bitter ones which lingers on and on. One thumb up for the beer on its own and one down for being a five buck brew to marcellars, but muchO thanks to Marcellars for carrying some really good beers! 1,066 charactersTroyS, Apr 09, 2009

5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This was so good. I'm a huge fan of stouts and was very impressed with this beer.
Appearance - black pour with a brown head that neither faded out or was too thick. Had the head coloring of what I expect from a good stout, some deep brown to it, not the usual white you see with any beer.
Smell - amazing coffee smell from the beginning. As with KBS, I would be happy if this came in an air freshener/inscence scent. If my house smelled like this year round I would come home happy.
Taste - what a taste. This was so good even compared to a night before of drinking KBS. Add a chocolate note and its the same beer. I am beyond pleased with the taste of this beer. Exceptional.
Mouthfeel - thick and syrupy, but in no way a bad thing. This beer definitely sticks with your palate. If you're drinking another stout or something you're planning on fully tasting, wait on this one. It stays with you. So good though, what I expect a good stout to be.
Drinkability - this is no all day beer for sure, but it goes down so smooth for the style. I couldn't get enough of this one, it makes me want more.
In all, a great beer. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of stouts. 1,181 charactersjdskinns, Apr 06, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the bottle a rich jet black with two fingers of creamy tan head.
Aroma of dark roasted malts, coffee beans, dark ripe fruit, raisins, caramel, vanilla, and a bit of booze.
Deep taste of espresso upfront along with dark chocolate, caramel, and vanilla. Finishes with espresso and a touch of bitterness. The alcohol is present but doesn't distract from the taste.
Full bodied, rich and creamy, with a moderate carbonation.
I expected a world class imperial stout and was not disappointed. 502 charactersMonkeyknife, Apr 02, 2009
4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Pitch black body. Thin khaki head. Nice retention of the head cap. Spotty lacing.
S: Rich roasted coffee. Dense. Like walking into a local coffee shop. Its not simply one blend. Complex and invigorating. Hints of coffee and caramel.
T: Doesn't quite live up to the nose... but thats something I find quite common with these upper level imperial stouts... the nose tends to to be the stand out feature. But this certainly is no slouch. Rich coffee, espresso, chocolate, roasted caramel and a ever so slight hint of alcohol.
M: Smooth. Ideal carbonation. Excellent lingering aftertaste.
D: Perhaps the most drinkable imperial stout I've had that has this much coffee in it. 
Merci beaucoup, Brasserie Dieu du Ciel! 720 characterscallmemickey, Apr 01, 2009
4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to Overlord for this beer.
Poured a dark brown, with a thin tan head. Smell is of coffee, with only a hint of malt sweetness. The taste was more of the same. A good stout. If it was available in Northern California, I could see myself drinking more of this. 265 charactersjwolfie70, Apr 01, 2009

Poured in a 0.4 L Steiner Pils snifter. Small dark foamy head, lingering. Very dark brown with reddish highlights, opaque. Aromas of coffee, sweet dark malt, tobacco, smoke. Tastes very much like a cold espresso. Lots of coffee throughout, lots of dark roasty malt. Dark chocolate finish and aftertaste. Did I mention all the coffee? Heavy creamy body. Ethanol is warming and pleasant. Very tasty, very easy to drink.
If you like coffee stouts this is your beer. 538 charactershtomsirveaux, Mar 28, 2009

Smell - Roasted malts, coffee.
Taste - Black coffee, some bitter chocolate notes. This is an intense, bitter beer, but a very enjoyable one with a great depth of flavors, particularly coffee.
Mouthfeel - Medium body, light carbonation with fine bubbles.
Drinkability - Full, rich flavor. Very nice sipping beer that does a dangerously good job of masking it's alcohol content. 444 charactersAenema, Mar 28, 2009

Pours a viscous jet black with a finger of tight cappuccino head, leaving good lacing all the way through.
Smells of fresh, gourmet coffee coffee, some dark chocolate, molasses, dark malts and a hint of alcohol tucked away in there.
The taste is luxurious. Lots of fresh coffee, surprising amounts of chocolate, molasses, and rich, full malts. Again, alcohol in the back. It drinks surprisingly easy for such a big brew, moderate/heavy body compared to the viscous way it pours. My only complaint is the slightly stronger presence of the alcohol than I would like.
This is one great coffee stout. So rich and complex while still highlighting the coffee front and center. I'll keep this one on my wants list! 913 charactersritzkiss, Mar 28, 2009

Smell: smoked wood, earth, coffee, very complex...arguably the best most complex smell from a beer I have had
Taste: smoked wood, earth, expresso, some chocolate, noticable alcohol
Mouthfeel: sharp, heavy, and full bodied
Drinkability: The smell is amazing. I could probably only have a couple due to the high ABV. The alcohol is noticable to me. Very good and complex. This is a sipper and this beer gets more bite as it warms. 478 characterstigg924, Mar 27, 2009
4.03/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 11.5 ounce bottle into my shaker "pint" glass. Appears a dark brown, nearly opaque color with a solid two fingers of creamy chestnut colored foam. The foam leaves a thick lacing on the inside of my glass as I sip my way to the bottom. The nose is unmistakeably that of fresh roasted espresso or other rich coffee beans, dark chocolate, deep roasted grains, alcohol, and molasses. The taste is full of coffee and chocolate. I can tell that a high quality coffee was roasted and infused into this stout. Bittersweet chocolate and baker's cocoa are also present as well as molasses and mocha. I'm not to keen on the bitterness that comes through in the finish, it just seems out of place. If it was wasn't for said bitterness, I would have scored a 4.5 for taste. Full bodied with medium carbonation. Overall, a fantastic coffee infused stout. If you like coffee, you'll dig this one. 895 charactersClockworkOrange, Mar 27, 2009

It pours out black and thick as coal and has an aroma of fresh roasted coffee and hint of chocolate. The taste is almost pure coffee with splashes of chocolate,anise, and alcohol. It would make a good after dinner beer or for the hardcore a great breakfast beer. 328 characterslocstir, Mar 26, 2009
4.13/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5A: Pours black, dark brown with a massive roasted brown head. This is a great looking beer.
S: Big time dark roasted coffee aromas. Other standard imperial stout descriptors, such as chocolate and roasted malts also present. But the biggest characteristic on this one is the coffee. Smells deliciously fresh brewed.
T/M: The coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts are all there. Slight chewiness to the mouthfeel but overall this is a very smooth and well-balanced imperial stout. It doesn't try to go overboard, which I appreciate. Bitterness is a little distracting on the finish, but overall this is an excellent one.
D: Very smooth for such an intense beer. If it wasn't $10 a bottle, then I'd rank this higher 715 charactersabfraser, Mar 26, 2009

A: The pour is rather thick, almost black with a fantastic head - Very big, pale brown color, thick and very creamy (almost reminiscent of a nitro-induced head). Very good head retention. The beer looks really great. Might be the best looking imperial stout I've ever had. 
S: Plenty of espresso-like coffee aromas, very rich and powerful. Freshly ground dark roasted coffee beans, plenty of dark chocolate, roasted malts and notes of toffee. 
T: Very rich and powerful. Strong espresso flavors, freshly ground coffee beans. Big dark chocolate flavors as well making the taste resemble that of café mocha. Some creamy notes. The coffee flavors are backed up by a very firm stout-backbone with a solid sweet maltiness. Some nuts and molasses. The bitterness in the finish is gentle and has a coffee bitterness feel to it. Some warming alcohol in the finish, but other than that the alcohol is very well hidden.
M: Full bodied, soft carbonation, slightly sticky and rather smooth.
D: This is a great beer with a wonderful espresso-like coffee profile. Rich, rather complex, powerful and dense. Even though the coffee flavors take the lead, it still feels very well balanced. 1,226 charactersricke, Mar 25, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This beer just recently became available in Kansas. It was pretty exciting to see it at Lukas Liquors.
A: black and oily with a brown hue, tan head that recedes into a nice lacing
S: the smell kind of explodes from the glass, initially smoky, followed by dark roasted coffee, a bit of some dark fruits in the background
T: loose leaf tobacco, a smokiness that is pretty unique, coffee, dark fruits initially but as the carbonation dies down, the smokiness takes over
M: moderate carbonation provides an initial bite that smooths out, lingering finish that seems to stain the mouth
D: this ought to be available in 750ml bottles, I wish I purchased more, quite complex and unique for the style, I haven't really experienced a combination of smokiness and coffee like this in a beer before 792 characterssjccmd, Mar 25, 2009
4.63/5  rDev +5.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Peche Mortel has been one of the more illusive beers for me. A friend who made the trip to Asheville, NC brought this back for me. 
Unknowingly, I decanted, er... plopped the beer into the chalice and watched the mousse-like head form to the point that the 12oz. bottle wouldn't fit. As I take the first few sips, the beer never relinquishes the head and leaves multiple rings of lacing behind. The beer is a dark brown-black and opaque as they come. An ideal look.
Very bold aromas of French Roast coffe, nutty-almond-ish scents, as well as cocoa, heavy cream, anise, and a hint of alcohol swirl about the glass. Very appetizing and inviting.
Coffee, cocoa, and roasted malts combine into a well balanced flood of flavor. The beer never favors any one character but the blend of them all give a subtle yet bold balance. Light favors of oats, heavy cream, licorce, and chocolate brownies are a few of the descriptors that make this beer special.
The body is remarkably smooth, silky, and light in comparison to thicker gravity bombs. The coffee bitterness amplifies the grassy-piney hop bitterness and questions whether it is too much for the relatively moderate weight. The beer lightens into a fluid and palatable finish with a linger of coffee and cocoa deep into the aftertaste. Dangerously drinkable for a 9.5%er.
I really appreciate the beer for focusing on the delicacy of flavor instead of the kick-in-the-teeth agression for which more recent Imperial Stouts are acclaimed. Though nothing is wrong with the beer, a more complex fruity character throughout would have made it a solid 5 across the board. Good luck finding a more pleasant drinking experience... with any beer.

4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A-Opaque black w/a hint of brown. A rich creamy brown head displays good retention, and a cloudy froth swirl remains through the consumption. A spotty lacing clings to the glass.
S-Rich and complex cafe mocha dominates. The roasty aroma also elicits notes of fertile earth, and a thin veil of dark dried fruits. More fruit emerges as the temperature rises. There is a nearly imperceptible amount of hops and a hint of smoke.
T&M-Wow. Creamy espresso w/dark chocolate and a hint of sweetness. Midway there is a delightful blend of a multitude of sensations: creamy coffee, tobacco, smoke, leather, dried currants. The body is interesting...full but velvety and creamy in a way that renders it deceptively light. The finish features a touch of hops, but not enough to cleanse the palate completely, which leaves a coating of sweet fresh coffee. Little noticeable alcohol.
D-This is an awesome beverage, and my last bottle I brought back from this brewery on my trip to Montreal. At least I saved the best for last. This Imp. Stout produces a feeling of well-being that extends beyond the palate. 1,093 charactersBoitSansSoif, Mar 25, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A- Nice medium sized light brown head that covers the dark black beer. The head retention could have been better and the lacing was minimal. 
S- Smells of dark roasted coffee, barley and tobacco smoke. Hints of dark fruit, plum, and some mild sweetness. Also some dark chocolate and alcohol presence. 
T- Dark juicy fruit up front moving it to nice dark chocolate notes and then dry bitter coffee flavors. There is a lot of dark roasted coffee flavors in this beer with some back notes of tobacco. A nice smokiness also adds to the flavor in this beer. I must say this is a very tasty beer. 
M- Very dry full bodied beer. This stuff is quite pleasant but reminds me of drinking a dry red wine. 
Overall I would say this is a very good beer. I am not sure it is worth the price but I am glad I got it and would recommend stout and porter lovers to try this beer. Great coffee and smoke notes great beer. 906 charactersbr3wmeister, Mar 24, 2009

A: Dark cola black with a thick creamy layer of light brown/beige head. Lacing is dense and thick all the way down the glass. Awesome!
S: HUGE roasted aroma of coffee and burnt malts.
T: The nose doesn't lie here, but there's so much more. An incredibly huge blast of burnt malts, coffee, chocolate. Very delicious!
M: Slightly intense at first, but as it warms it really smooths out and becomes very, very mellow and easily drinkable.
D: Delicious and pretty high in alcohol, but I don't think that could dissuade me from drinking several of these in a sitting. 678 charactersjulian, Mar 24, 2009

Pours a 1 and a half finger dark dark tan head. Very full and think. Wow! Color is a like a black hole. I couldn't see anything through the glass, even when held up to the light. Good head retention and splattered lace.
Aroma is very chocolately, coffee, and mocha. A lot of malt aroma. The 9.5% abv is present here.
Taste is very deep and dense. Dark chocolate, coffee, roasty malts. This kind of tastes like hot chocolate that is not hot. The alcohol is also present. I also taste some sort of hops, but it is masked from all the malts.
Mouthfeel comes off with a bitter bite, then gets a little more smooth. A little booze comes through but not that much. The end finish is very clean, almost too clean. Carbonation is good.
Overall, this one is a sipper. Very complex AND filling. Very flavorful and I really enjoyed the coffee. I don't think I could enjoy two of these in one sitting. 930 charactersmothman, Mar 23, 2009

M - A smooth creamy body, moderately low carbonation, and a relatively dry finish.
D - Very good. A great, complex dark malt character that never becomes cloying or harsh and allows the beer to be an unusually drinkable example of the style. This is a wonderful beer that lives up to its hype. 720 charactersnickfl, Mar 23, 2009

Albert Camus
Appearance: Poured out of an 11.5 oz. bottle into a Chimay goblet. This beer pours an inky black color with a beautiful, dark tan colored head that seems to rise from the depths of the glass. The head looks very soft and creamy, and leaves a moderate amount of lace on the glass. Definitely one of the best looking stouts I've had the pleasure to drink.
Smell: The nose of this beer hits like a truck, smelling strongly of coffee and chocolate. This is the sort of coffee smell that makes my morning cup of coffee jealous. I'm one of those people that will walk down the coffee isle in the grocery store or in Wal-Mart just so I can smell that wonderful coffee aroma, and this beer isn't too far removed from that. Overall this is a fabulous smelling brew.
Taste: When I reviewed Founders' Breakfast Stout I thought that it was the most coffee-dominated beer in the world, but I can truly say that FBS has relinquished this crown and given it to Peche Mortel. This beer tastes like coffee through and through, with hints of chocolate and blackstrap molasses to remind you that you're drinking a beer and not an iced coffee. These flavors are very prominent in the beginning, with a wonderful richness that fades to a moderate amount of hop bitterness that is supplemented by the bitterness of the coffee, giving this beer a pleasant, earthy finish. Overall this beer lies somewhere between an espresso and a mocha, and is a true joy to drink for any coffee lover. If you aren't a coffee lover, I still urge you to try this beer, but be warned - this intense coffee flavor isn't for the faint of heart.
Mouthfeel: This is a wonderfully smooth, thick, stout. It is also very full-bodied, but I've still had better mouthfeel in a stout. Peche Mortel is near the top of the list, but it still doesn't quite reach the lofty rating of a 5.
Drinkability: There is absolutely no taste of the 9.5% alcohol the bottle claims this beer has, and I could definitely see myself getting into trouble with this one. The flavors, the body, the nose, and the smoothness of this beer combine to make for one incredibly drinkable stout.
Notes: In my opinion Peche Mortel and Founders Breakfast Stout are very similar beers, but I think that Founders Breakfast Stout is just a little bit better. While they're both coffee intensive, Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel's Peche Mortel is almost too much like coffee and too little like beer, whereas Founders' Breakfast Stout it much more balanced. Despite that fact, the richness of this brew is almost unparalleled, and you can't help but to feel a bit sinful while drinking it. 2,786 charactersjohnmichael712, Mar 22, 2009
3.84/5  rDev -12.7%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Peche Mortel, the beer geeks wet dream. I doubt I'll be able to do this any sort of justice because it's probably out of my league at this point, but here we go:
Dark. Very dark. The little tan head that was there in the beginning is long gone. There is no lacing either. Just a dark liquid with fine carbonation remains.
The smell is strong coffee & dark chocolate. The taste is also very strong .. coffee... sweet roasted malts.. and bitter dark chocolate towards the end. But it's all got an amplification factor of 10. I don't know how it's possible to pack that much intensity into a liquid and it still taste good. Initially the alcohol is quite noticeable but it's less so towards the end.
Mouthfeel is great.. silky smooth but drinkability for this style is average.. no one is pounding these back. 809 charactersRalphus, Mar 21, 2009
4.34/5  rDev -1.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4In a snifter:
Péché's coffee head pours a bit thin, and it's lacing doesn't hold very long but looks really cool. The body is definitely interesting: dark brown with a bit of purple.Smells enticing and draws you in. Lots of dark fruit, raisin, and coffee - specifically mocha... Smells like Starbucks, really. Tastes fantastic, so sweet but so biiter. Aftertaste perfectly balances wonderful fruits and roasted maltiness. Anise, raisins can be found in there. Thick body, creamy, and great carbonation means this brew altogether feels fantastic on the tongue. The presence of a taste of alcohol and bitter dimensions diminishes it's drinkability somewhat, but altogether delicious and desirable.
Overall: I really love this beer and wish it was easier to get a hold of. Very unique and fruity variety of stout. 814 charactersschroederm, Mar 21, 2009
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 411.2 oz single purchased from City Beverage in Winston-Salem, NC. Poured into an over-sized wine glass. 
A: Pours a complete jet black with only the slightest of red highlights around the edges when held up to the light. A nice 1/2 inch thick frothy brown head is there after the initial pour. The head settles relatively quickly into a ring with a haze of bubbles in the middle. Each swallow leaves behind a nice ring of tiny bubbled lacing. Only thing keeping it from a 5 is the retention.
S: Huge dark roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate aromas. A beautiful aroma. 
T: A huge blast of coffee flavor in the initial taste. The only slightly sweet component of the flavor comes from the dark chocolate taste. Even that provides as much bitterness as it does sweet. The coffee and dark roasted malts make it even more bitter. The alcohol is very well hidden. This one is a good beer, but a little too far on the coffee side for me compared to some of its competitors in the style.
M: Very thick and very smooth. It is very enjoyable to just roll around on the tongue.
D: The big huge bitterness of this one makes it a slow sipper for me. Its feel help make it go down a little easier. 1,188 charactersGatorBeerNerd, Mar 19, 2009
4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Smallish bottle poured into a dogfish snifter.
A small ring of head around the edges, leaving a small amount of spotty lacing. when swirled, it really coats the glass well. 
The aroma is of strong, espresso like coffee. There is also some bitter chocolate which becomes more apparant as this warms. 
The taste is consistent mainly of the nose: espresso with some dark, bitter chocolate. It is really pretty great. There are some roasted malts, and it is getting much better, and more chocolaty as it warms up, in a bitter, good way. 
The Mouthfeel is where this beer really, really shines. It is absolutly perfect for the style. Nice and coating, with a viscious (sp?) feel to it. You can tell it is thick, just by the way it coats the glass. 
I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes good coffee, and some bitter dark chocolate. 841 charactersmikecharley, Mar 17, 2009
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Impenetrable dark glossy brown, black in most light. Tall fluff of dark tan foam sits atop and lasts breifly before a skim and solid ring sit always present. Lots of broken sheeted lace coats the glass.
Aroma is well seeded in a dark roasted coffee, deep and espresso tinted in blackness with bitter dark chocolate, burnt cream, and a titch of heat.
Taste is firmly set in a blackened realm of coffee, chocolate, and cream. Burntish notes abound, charred and nearly smokey espresso with raw, fresh, hoppy pine length subdued in the burntness underneath. Lofty and long dryish charred finish with bits of dark chocolate bitterness kissing the lips all the while keeping a firm tone across the palate with a uniquely charming boldness of burnt stuff.
Feel is one creamy smooth body with an incredibly well balanced dryness of blackened/charred things adding to its mediumness and fairly lenghty boldness.
A fine stout to be sure with a burnt blackness well in control and balanced with an ease about it thats quite unique and easy to handle and drink. Glad to see its become available here in the TC area...finally. I'll probably pick up a few more bottles next time I see it stocked. 1,186 characterstavernjef, Mar 17, 2009

Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Has a chocolate malt aroma with hints of dark fruit and coffee. Just a hint of alcohol is detected. Malt flavor up front. Chocolate and slightly fruity. The coffee does not come into play until the finish. This coffee stout is much more balanced than other coffee infused beers. A little warmth from the alcohol in the finish. Big body with low carbonation. Creamy and a good texture overall. I enjoyed this beer. The high ABV and high cost limits the amount I drink of this beer. Not the big coffee beer I was expecting but a balanced stout with fresh coffee flavor. This is a good stout with coffee flavors, not coffee with some beer flavor. 773 charactersmorimech, Mar 15, 2009
4.31/5  rDev -2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Out of a bottle this beer was a true, opaque black color. The tan head was three fingers thick and retained nicely as a cap that became rocky after a while leaving excellent curtains of lacing all the way down. The aroma smelled strongly of fresh coffee, bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt. The flavors were rich and delicious. I tasted hints of chocolate malt sweetness first then lots of deep, rich coffee, bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, espresso and hints of pipe tobacco. The bitterness was distinct but not biting and the finish lingered pleasantly on my tongue. Notably acidic, especially because of the coffee, but this helped cut through the thicker body of the beer. The mouthfeel was smooth, the carbonation soft and the body full. I thought this was excellent, like drinking a cup of fresh brewed coffee that just happened to be alcoholic and served chilled. If you like coffee stouts like I do you cannot miss this. 937 charactersthekevlarkid, Mar 15, 2009

A. The brew pours an opaque black with a cream to light tan head that shows very nice lacing.
S. A bit of funk in the beginning, but the roasty malt character shows up with a strong coffee note.
T. All malt at first, with notes of toast. The coffee takes control, and overwhelms the palate for a short time, and it is followed by a light, dry hop finish. 
M. Full-bodied and very thick, it's definitely a sipper. The flavors linger on the palate for minutes after each sip. Depending on how fast it is consumed, the finish may still continue beyond.
D. One of the most drinkable Imperial Coffee Stouts out there. I can see why it placed on the "Top Big-Ass Stouts" list. Delicious, and very easy to drink. I'm glad I bought a few bottles. 775 charactersWYVYRN527, Mar 15, 2009

Fantastic smell. Very fresh, almost sweet. Lots of very light coffee, with good amount of bitter and sweet chocolate smells to back it up.
Taste was a lot of coffee and roasted dark chocolate. Very complex taste, yet thin beer overall.
Mouthfeel was creamy and smooth but not too thick.
A bit complex to be very drinkable, but I could definitely enjoy a few of these. 476 characterstittymcj, Mar 14, 2009

My memory was fuzzy the first time that I had this beer, so another tasting is in order.
A: Pure ink, black as an ebony princess @ dusk, nice 2 cm head that resolved itself slowly. Lacing evident, but not extreme.
S: Unfortunately my nose is slightly congested, but the coffee and cocoa sure breaks through to activate a very pleasurable. Huge roasted coffee mixed with a melted with a pile of cocoa that just got doused in some cold water, perhaps a bit or rye wafter, toffee, vanilla, banana?
T: Nice to meet you bitter coffee, really tasty too, nothing like an hour old pot of coffee. What comes next it a great dark chocolate coating that leaves a trace a smoke that soon dematerializes into a great roasted dryness. The alcohol was only evident when I burped, but almost like alcoholic chocolate milk.
M: Syrupy mouthfeel, maybe influenced by the pleasant sweet chocolate nature of the beer. Certainly does not overstay its welcome.
D: 9.5% are you lying? Great beer, will seek out a few and make others drink some. 1,048 charactersMPLS, Mar 14, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Pitch black. As I was pouring this with only a bit left in the bottle I was wondering where the head was and all of a sudden it exploded into a thick 2-3 finger brown cap before gradually receding into a thin layer.
Pleasant heavily citric coffee aroma, but more subtle than many other big coffee stouts...some of that citric aroma may be a touch of hops, though the aroma is definitely not hoppy. These aromas meld nicely with a little alcohol and hints of dark fruits.
Thick as hell and silky. Coats the tongue with bittersweet combination of citric coffee and tons of dark chocolate. Slight hop bitterness, and I am suspecting that some of those hops are contributing to the citric flavors as well. Finishes sweet and sugary, doesn't quite get to the point of being cloying. Alcohol is noticeable and is accompanied by the same hints of dark fruits as in the nose. The alcohol adds richness to this similar to the way rum adds richness to tiramisu. Definitely a sipper. 974 charactersNCBeernut, Mar 13, 2009
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 511.5oz bottle into a tulip.
A - Opaque, very dark brown beer with one inch of sticky, cinnamon-colored foam. Gorgeous lacing.
S - Smells a tad sweet, with roasted barley, coffee, and dark chocolate.
T - Rich, roasty character with plenty of coffee flavor, but without the harsh bitterness present in some other coffee beers. Subtle, gentle bitterness adds to the delicious flavor profile while keeping a pleasant sweetness in check. Dark chocolate comes in around the middle and lingers in the long finish. No hop flavor or aroma present, but earthy hop bitterness builds with each sip.
M - Full body reminiscent of coffee with cream. Restrained carbonation allows the creamy texture to shine.
D - Spectacular. This beer could be equally at home with brunch or for a nightcap. It does offer a slight buzz, but there's no hint of alcohol on the palate. A great slow sipper, this beer exceeds all my expectations. 916 characterstrbergman, Mar 12, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a light-destroying black with a creamy tan head that reminds me a lot of a nitro-poured Rasputin. Head is incredibly resilient, and hasn't moved much in the ten minutes since I poured. Lacing? This beer leaves a cloud-like translucent tan covering on the glass. 
It would unfair to say this beer simply smells like coffee. Think of the way freshly brewed coffee smells the moment you pick up on the aroma. That room-filling, mouth-watering effect that quality fresh-ground coffee seems to have, especially first thing in the morning (my mouth is literally watering right now). Joining this are hints of dark chocolate and vanilla. Superb, probably the best aroma of any coffee stout I've experienced.
The taste is sweet rich dark chocolate and espresso, with a perfect balance of hops and malt helping sort things out. The finish that remains between sips is virtually identical to what you get after downing a few of those chocolate covered espresso beans. 
Mouthfeel is very smooth and crisp, and despite being relatively full-bodied, a touch thinner-bodied than I would have preferred. Carbonation is medium to high, and the 9.5 % abv is very well masked. 
An absolute must-try for the coffee-loving BA. Dieu Du Ciel has absolutely nailed the style. 1,262 charactersThirdLap, Mar 11, 2009
4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.512 fl oz brown bottle; served in a snifter.
Pours an opaque chocolate with a somewhat syrupy consistency. Inch-high, dense coffee-colored foam. Thin and spotted lacing with pretty good strength.
Semi-sweet, rich caramel and milk chocolate. Deep, spicy espresso. Light vanilla over the rich aromatics. Hints of slightly hidden vinous fruit: cherry, plum, and red grape.
Deep, rich coffee and dark chocolate malt character. Nutty flavors of hazlenut and almond, add a pleasant dryness. Following the sweet, yet rich malts is a cutting, yet rounded alcohol presence. A deep, bitter espresso and mocha flavor add to the mouthful of floral hops and last well into the aftertaste. Rich, complex, rounded, and very flattering.
Full bodied; rich and chewy, but never overpowering. The flavors are really in line with a consistent, balanced texture.
For a rich, filling, Double Stout at 9.5% abv, this is simply delicious and all I want is another one. I remember loving this at the VT brewer's fest. Thank God that this is now available in MA. Hands down, this is one brew to seek out. I can't wait to sample Dieu Due Ciel's other offerings. 1,138 charactersNEhophead, Mar 11, 2009
4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4G: Poured into an oversized brandy snifter.
A: Dark chocolate color that is nearly opaque out of the bottle during the pour and becomes completely so in the glass. Pours about a finger's worth of creamy, tan head, which dissipates rather quickly, leaving a bubbly black surface. Quite a bit of lacing remains as it goes down (or, towards the beginning, after a swirl).
S: Sweetness with a little bit of acidity. Cherries come to mind, along with a little bit of chocolate. After inhaling deeply, these scents almost immediately bow down to the powerful coffee/espresso presence. 
T: Strong and unbelievably-tasty coffee presence! Smooth notes of caramel and chocolate, with a little of the aforementioned dark cherries. Slightly roasted and a little bitter. 
M: Incredibly smooth and medium-to-full bodied. Not too much carbonation, and the alcohol is well hidden, although it is felt on the cheeks. 
D: A little too strong and pungent to be excessively drinkable, although it is still quite drinkable for its style. All in all, this is an excellent offering and I'm quite glad I was able to finally get my hands on some. 1,126 charactersThorpe429, Mar 11, 2009
4.14/5  rDev -5.9%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Being a coffee addict, a buddy of mine suggested I try a peche. And I was not disappointed.
This beer is black with a small receding head.
Maybe I am coming down with a cold but I did not get a lot of the coffee in the smell of this beer. I got a lot of the vanilla and chocolate notes i expected though.
There's the coffee I was looking for. I can also taste figs and vanilla. The sweetness definitely balances the bitter of the coffee and dark chocolate flavors.
The mouth feel was where the beer felt short. For my taste, and this style of beer, the carbonation was a bit overwhelming. Almost like a soda that had sat out for an hour. Although the redeeming quality was that it had a very dry after taste akin to a cappuccino or a shot of espresso.
The alcohol was very well hidden in this beer. You could probably sit down and drink a couple of these. 860 charactersHairOfTh3Dog, Mar 10, 2009

MF: Super thick, creamy and smooth. Truly coats the mouth. The carbonation is understated but not weak. In a word: perfect!
T: Bitter chocolate and licorice up front that cedes to the strong coffee/espresso flavors quickly. There is some bitterness in the aftertaste not unlike after a sip of espresso. The 9.5% abv is well-hidden.
Overall: Wonderful wonderful stout. This is what i look for in a stout and I'd put it up there with the best of 'em! 606 charactersjkendrick, Mar 09, 2009

I have to say I love coffee stouts. This is my new favorite. After reading many BA posts I was lucky to encounter Peche Mortel! One of the best coffee stouts Ive ever had.
A- Brownish almost black head,slightly thin but stays, minimal glass lacing but what do you expect for a coffee stout?
S- Smell of hints of chocolate, also slight bits of vanilla, and caramel. Mostly domiinated by the expresso beans.
T- I taste chocolate, coffee and as it warms a slight alcohol taste. Awesome coffee taste
M- Smooth! for 9 and a half ABV its barely noticeable. Nice palate finish. I find myself wanting more of the silky, robust feel.
D- God I wish it was lighter! If so, it would be a great session beer. Because of its heaviness, as all coffee stouts are..its a dessert beer..to be slowly savoured and enjoyed. Boy did I enjoy it! 871 charactersManofMead, Mar 09, 2009
4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 512 oz bottle poured into a snifter.
Pours dark milk chocolate color and settles in an opaque, near black liquid with a modest cream coffee colored head that slowly dissipates to a thick crown with some bubbles. Nice lacing and liquid tends to slowly coat the inside of the glass. Aroma is exactly like ground coffee beans with a slight bitterness. Body is very thick and creamy, with little carbonation poking through. Strong milk chocolate sweetness and coffee dryness, but little bitterness. Alcohol also provides a warming sensation in the finish. Definitely upper tier of coffee stouts, but missing something for me to put it over the top into the omg-category of stuff like the founder's stouts or speedway. 713 charactersyourefragile, Mar 09, 2009

COFFEE! a little over the top. smells like hot coffee grinds. dark chocolate.
Smooth choc turns to a bitter espresso at the back. thick black coffee. nice flavors but a little much. a little too heavy and syrupy.
similar to slightly carbonated turkish coffee. its thick. lingering sweetness adds up on the palate.
coffee gets overpowering. im glad this beer is only 12 oz. 541 charactersimagineiii, Mar 08, 2009

Smooth creamy mouthfeel, nice and soft. Goes down smooth, and with 9.5 ABV it goes down EASY, I love this beer, and Im going to have to go back and pick up more of these to share with friends. 471 charactersFatduck, Mar 08, 2009

A-Pours a very dark brown looks black but up to direct light is a very deep brown. Head on it is thin but stays the entire length of the beer.
S-Most noteable deep roasted malt and chocolate. Very bittersweet. get small note of alcohol in the back.
T-I can't see it getting any better than this for the coffee stout. All the notes from the nose come thru with a very distinct almost figgy sweetness. Very rich and bold flavor from the first sip to the last.
M-Rich and thick nice heavy body that feels like its coating the inside of your mouth. Carbonation is perfect.

smell is rich chocolate malt and a hint of esspresso but suprisingly not much coffee in the smell. a slight alcohol burn in the back. some yeast and a slight fig notes.
An upfront bite and a quickly smoothing flavors of rich chocolate and strong coffee. so smooth. no real words.
mouthfeel is an upfront bitterness that quickly givesway to smooth and rich finish. This would be dangerous if it were cheaper. 541 charactersnaterock, Mar 08, 2009

Appearance- dark black with a healthy and active head with plenty of lace.
Smell- Coffee. Lots and lots of it.
Taste- Lots of strong coffee notes, but not as much as you'd expect based on the smell. There's a lot more going on with the taste and that's a good thing. Milk chocolate, dark chocolate, caramel, subdued hop bitterness, coffee bean bitterness, and cream at the finish. Very good.
Mouthfeel- Very nice. Full thick body with a creamy finish.
Drinkability- Great drinkability for a big and thick beer. Very very good overall. Certainly worthy of its status as one of the best. 759 characterslpayette, Mar 08, 2009

Pours a color that's black as night and there's a two-finger head that fades after a minute or so. Definitely has it there.
Aroma is creamy with a nice hint of chocolate, cream and mild coffee in the nose. 
Taste is smooth and a bit creamy with a nice coffee kick that becomes more pronounced in the middle. Not too strong and certainly not weak by a long shot.
Mouthfeel is full of roasted coffee, cream and light chocolate, especially towards the back of the throat. Carbonation is somewhat high but not too bad. 
Very nice! I remember it being much better on tap but if this is the closest I can get to it, it's more than good. I'd definitely buy another bottle to age. 727 charactersBrad007, Mar 07, 2009

Appearance: Pours a dark, dark brown, with an incredibly thick, frothy brown head that lingered for quite some time. Heavy lacing.
Smell: Dark chocolate, bitter roasted malts, lactose, hints of coffee. No one scent is overpowering, but they all seem to blend together. The coffee does become more apparent as the beer warms. Smell is sweeter than the taste...
Taste: Strong coffee notes, but not overpoweringly so - they blend together exceptionally well with the other roasted malts. Hints of chocolate in the background. The coffee flavors add a nice bitterness to the aftertaste. This beer actually tastes like beer with coffee flavoring, not like pure coffee, which is a good thing. Minimal hop notes. Overall, surprisingly smooth. Very good beer. No evidence of the 9.5% ABV.
Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy, almost chewy. Pretty much exactly what I'm looking for in a stout, although I did feel the carbonation was a little bit high.
Drinkability: Incredibly well balanced, and one of the first beers with coffee that didn't have an overpowering coffee flavor. Very good beer, and well worth the hype. If it weren't so expensive, I'd definitely seek it out more often. 1,221 charactersStarlightSeraph, Mar 07, 2009

S - Intense roasted coffee and bitter chocolate up front. I smell some black liqourice in there too. Hops are a bit muted due to the coffee flavor, but they're still showing up in the nose.
M - Extremely viscous, such a smooth creamy mouthfeel. One of the best mouthfeels I've come across in an imperial stout. 
T - I'm a coffee lover, and this one has a great roasted coffee flavor. Bitter coffee and chocolate just as the nose suggests. Tastes like a black mocha iced coffee with some hops thrown in. Alcohol is well-hidden until I get that nice warmth after the first few sips. 
D - Can't give this a 5 as the alcohol does creep up on you as get into the beer. But damn is it inviting. A great beer, a great coffee stout, however Founder's Breakfast Stout still holds my number one spot. I did buy two other bottles to compare after a year or two, but I'm not sure I'd want any of the bitter roasted flavor to fade in this one. 1,055 charactersAlcahueteJ, Mar 07, 2009
4.54/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into snifter like used motor oil and producing no head but a nice little swiel. Oily liquid leaves a nice film on the glass & sets up a nice, tan polka dot effect. 
French-espresso roast coffee beans dominate the nose as well as nutty cream, oak, and a distinct boozy perfume; like a juniper dipped in alcohol. Notes of vanilla bean, brown sugar & hops. 
Smooth cappuccino, roasted grain, caramel and vanilla wood up front. Baker's chocolate, honeycomb, hop, and booze round everything out. Considering the high ABV, balanced extremely well. Initial velvet mouthfeel is left bone dry from a slap of hops and bitter cocoa. The throat smiles with a boozy warmth. 
A great representation of the style combined with an impressive aroma. I wonder if I am going to get a caffeine buzz. Highly recommended. 809 charactersjdoncbus, Mar 05, 2009

A: Pretty much the liquid equivalent of the "I'm Black, Y'all" song from CB4. Rather anemic tan-colored head.
S: Coffee, coffee, coffee. Pretty much a one-note espressso sledgehammer, but what a note it is. As it warms up, chocolate malt becomes more apparent.
T: Even more coffee. Difficult to tell where stout roastiness ends and espresso roastiness begins. Bitter and sweetened chocolate flavors also make an appearance. Not a whole lot of hop character, but that's OK. As far as stouts go, I prefer coffee bitterness to hoppy bitterness.
M: Thick and creamy. Kind of like an espresso milkshake.
D: An epic brew worthy of its cult following. I don't even like coffee that much, but this beer makes it work. 787 charactersBarrelO, Mar 05, 2009

The aroma is prominent coffee, malt, some hints of chocolate and an occasional whiff of sweet cream and butterscotch. Taste produces initial sweetness, the coffee is immediately apparent. This is quite complex with bittersweet bursts of taste weaved in between syrupy malt. This reminds me of Founders Breakfast Stout with espresso and some syrup. The last taste is a bit on the bitter side with a strong alcohol warming. This is thick and chewy just like I enjoy em. For me mouthfeel is hard to describe but when I taste them I know them. Drinkability is great for what this is but I'm afraid I am 1-2 and done for this one. This here is a tremendous offering but not at all sessionable. 803 charactersjstilwell, Mar 05, 2009

A: Completely opaque black when held to the light. Pours with 3 fingers of dirty brown head, which recedes slowly over a couple of minutes into a film on the top. No lacing down the glass. 
S: Espresso, a surprisingly strong amount of alcohol, and roasted malts. An extremely slight note of figs that I recognized after tasting. 
T: Espresso bitter, straight up -- blends seamlessly with the sweet malt roastiness. Those two flavors dominate the taste until the finish, which gives hints of smokiness, chocolate, and figs. A little warmth in the aftertaste, but much lighter than expected given the prominent alcohol nose. 
M: Silky smooth. Full-bodied, with light to medium carbonation -- maybe a bit high for the style. It would be smoother with fewer bubbles. Not too much alcohol warmth; well masked for the 10%. 
D: Not bad. I tried this mainly out of curiosity, because coffee stouts aren't my thing. However, on general stout terms it has a very good body and feel, and it certainly lives up to its claim of being a coffee-flavored beverage. If I ever get into coffee stouts I'll come back to this one. 1,143 charactersArbitrator, Mar 03, 2009

Coffee is the first thing to hit the nose, espresso-like, but it quickly gives way to a chocolatey, nougat-like sweetness, lots of bitter dark chocolate in there. Taste is dominated by the coffee, although there is a faint hint of banana in there. Has a nice roasted flavor with a dark chocolate bitterness capped off with a stout coffee aftertaste.
A very tasty brew that gives Breakfast Stout a run for it's money. Time for a side-by-side comparison. 607 characterssaintwarrick, Mar 02, 2009

Pours pitch black with a nice brownish head that quickly fades to a small wispy layer of foam on the top and around the glass.
Smells heavenly, big coffee notes, and chocolate come together to form a euphoric ambrosia of beery goodness.
It actually taste better than it smells. First I get the coffee, then the smoothness of the chocolate malts come in, and lastly a sharp bitter blast of roasted barley and the coffee come back for a nice finish.
Feels nice a creamy but the carbonation is a little much.

The smell is really strong of coffee and roasted malts. The taste is coffee up front. The coffee flavor is more like coffee-flavored ice cream than regular coffee or espresso in that it's sweet & not real bitter. Roasted malts, dark-skinned fruits, and spices are also there & stay with you at the end. Mouthfeel is a little carbonated but leaves thick & smooth. 
This is a drinkable beer that should be savored by sipping. The alcohol content is covered so well with the coffee flavor, it's almost like having a coffee drink rather than beer. Interesting. 710 characterstheghost3, Mar 01, 2009
4.22/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to fellow Beachwood patrons for bringing this in.
Appearance: Poured with a huge coffee-colored black head. Settled down a bit, with some transient but extant lacing. Body is a deep shade of jet black.
Smell: Espresso, nutmeg, caramel, coconut. Alcohol on the back end. The espresso is assertive, but not as assertive as something like Terrapin Wake and Bake, and blends fairly nicely. Others tasting thought it just pushed their limits of tolerance for coffee flavor in beer. I could see how one could go that route, but only if you naturally aren't much of a coffee person. To me, it was quite a fantastic and mostly balanced aroma.
Taste: Roastiness, cocoa. The espresso is a bit more subdued into just medium bodied coffee here. Alcohol on the back end. 
Mouthfeel: Thick, but a bit flat. The thickness saved it, though.
Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable - even dangerously so. A great stout. 911 charactersRidiculedDisplay, Mar 01, 2009

Bottle poured into Sam Adams tasting glass, beer pours dark as a moonless night with a nice two finger light brown dense head.
Aromas are complex deep roasty malt, tawny port wine, espresso, malted milk, bitter chocolate.
Flavor is big coffee and espresso upfront. Chocolate, melanoidins, dark rum, candied/caramelized apple and pear. Not much in the way of hops, assume either minimal or aged out, not missed either way.
Big body with sweetness balanced by roasted barley and dark roast coffee. Finish is sweet with some grain/coffee bitterness to lean toward some dryness. Alcohol is exceptionally well hidden in flavor but also helps to present some drier balance.
Absurdly drinkable and delicious. 726 charactersPBoegel, Mar 01, 2009

I don't even drink coffee in everyday life, but I love the smell of it. They have the smell down. Big espresso, and not old grounds like you get from some stouts, fresh ground. Chocolate and dark fruit lay underneath. The taste is the same espresso up front, dark chocolate, and hints of cherry in the finish. 
The 9.5% is not apparent, and mouthfeel is just right, not to thin not to thick. 
Péché Mortel is pricey, but well worth it. My new #1 Imperial (coffee) Stout. I can get FBS for about 11$ a 4-pack, so it will always be a great go to beer for a coffee stout fix, but Péché Mortel will be the one when I want to treat myself. 778 charactersjp62099, Feb 26, 2009

A: Pours thick dark brown with a huge creamy brown head, about 2-3 fingers with amazing retention. Leaves some nice lacing and a head that stays with the drink the entire way down. Wish the lacing would have stuck top to bottom, but still very impressive. 
S: Strong espresso accompanied by strong malts and some bittersweet chocolate. It's hard to find notes past the espresso but with some agitation they come out. 
T: Yum! strong roasted espresso dominates the palate overall. Strong roasted malts that turn into strong bittersweet chocolate. Overall a highly roasted drink in any aspect you take from it. The alcohol comes out just a bit at the end which almost produces a spiced rum flavor. Some might think it's over powering but I believe that this drink knew what it was going for an nailed it perfectly. 
M: Well carbonated and not an extremely heavy body. Just the way I like it for the style, not too carbonated but just enough to help bring out as much flavor as the drink can offer. 
D: Pretty drinkable for how big of a drink this is, its just light enough in body to stay a bit above "sipper" level. This is one of my favorite beers hands down. Pick this one up or trade if you're a coffee fan. 1,254 charactersAdmiralDiaz, Feb 25, 2009
4.05/5  rDev -8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into nonic pint glass.
A - Jet black, completely opaque. Three fingers of dense, dark brown head rise. Retention is decent with moderate lacing. Certainly one of if not the darkest beer I can remember seeing.
S - Espresso as others have pointed out is the dominant aroma. Perhaps a touch of roastiness and sweetness hiding out but this is unmistakably a coffee infused brew.
T - Expectedly, huge coffee/espresso taste. After the main flavor subsides a bit there are traces of caramel and earthiness. The alcohol quickly takes over and leads into a roasted and coffee-like bitterness that lingers for minutes afterwards.
M - Oily and full bodied with a moderate carbonation. I was surprised that the carbonation wasn't a bit softer.
D - Peche Mortel is an excellent coffee beer but in the end this isn't one of my favorite styles. However, I can certainly see how it excels over many of it's counterparts. Ultimately big strong coffee flavored beers with the added big ABV make this a little less than drinkable for me. Objectively the experience is an intense one, and personally these just aren't flavors that I care to gulp down too quickly. A decent beer, but not worth the money for my palate. 1,232 charactersPatrickJR, Feb 23, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Poured into a Charleston Beer Exchange pint glass from a bottle. Pours black with a thin brown head.
S - Espresso, not a lot else. That's not a bad thing.
T - Really phenomenal deep and complex coffee flavor. Espresso is the name of the game here. Dark fruits and a sort of dark rum/raisin essence are present as well. Underlying chocolate flavor that shows up a bit more in the finish. The coffe/chocolate finish sticks around for a good while.
M - Creamy, slightly viscous. 
Notes - Fantastic. Just fantastic. 519 charactersHeyItsChili, Feb 22, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours very black and viscous. The light brown head is made of very fine creamy bubbles. The smell is without a doubt coffee. Not so much of a smell from roasted barley, but more a definite authentic coffee. There is some sweetness behind there as well. The taste has much roasted barley along with the additional coffee flavor. Sweetened dark chocolate in the taste as well. Thick and creamy in the mouth but not tooo thick. Very good beer, although the roastiness/coffee left in the mouth would limit me wanting to have too much of it. 536 charactersMiScusi, Feb 22, 2009
4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4A- The color is of a black hole, I think it sucked up some of the light from my computer monitor. The 1" head was rather late forming but nice and dark brown/taupe. Left a little sludge in the bottom of the glass
S- Strong black coffee, hints of licorice and bitter chocolate. I don't have to trim my nose hairs anymore, nice pungent singe.
T- Fair trade coffee, liquid smoke, tobacco, and molasses
M- Viscous, a touch gritty and left a dry feeling in the after taste
D- I wouldn't drink this late at night, I'd be up all night. Personally I like my coffee in the morning but still very enjoyable and would drink again 622 charactersbrokenleadedcask, Feb 21, 2009
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5pours an oily, inky black with hints of brown at the edges. A bright brown one-finger creamy head has great retention, fading to a thin cap that leaves copious amounts of lacing. 
aroma is "holy crap that's a lot of coffee." french pressed french roast mixes with some heavy espresso notes and a hint of cane sugar. just a touch of malt... but the coffee is king. a touch of dark fruit and a smidgen of alcohol.
tastes like espresso with a healthy spoon of sugar. Rich, earthy, and inky. a hint of chocolate and a bit of dark cherry comes through. An intense coffee bitterness (in a good way) comes up to finish with a beautiful coffee bitterness with just a smidgen of hops. fairly one-dimensional, but I love coffee, so it's alright with me.
mouth is chewy, full, rich, and smooth without being overwhelming. A nice carbonation helps everything flow well and helps accentuate the coffee notes. A nice light airy note prevents this from being unnecessarily thick and gummy.
Impressive, to say the least. This one might make me drink coffee again. Fairly one dimensional... not as much depth as some of the other coffee stouts, but the beautiful roasted coffee notes makes up for it. This one is almost too easy to drink - the alcohol hides nicely... definitely worth seeking this one out. 1,293 charactersdjeucalyptus, Feb 20, 2009
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I'm glad to have the opportunity to try this legendary coffee beer. Huge thanks to beachbum1975 for sending this one my way. 
A - Pours pitch black with a small tan head that leaves no lacing. One could say that it is very similar to espresso.
S - Not as overwhelming as I expected but coffee does make up the majority of it. As the beverage warms chocolate and roasted caramel malts can be detected.
T - This one did not disappoint, coffee dominates with a very bittersweet chocolate complimentary flavor right along side. As someone that doesn't use cream or sugar, the extreme bitterness of this beer is definitely appreciated! I am taking my time drinking this and it just keeps getting better.
M - Thick and slick with enough carbonation to keep it lively with each sip. 
D - I am glad to have kept this on my wants. I have almost finished this one and am ready for another. A delicious stout that isn't overly sweet or filling like so many others out there. 968 charactersbifrostguard, Feb 20, 2009
4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Pours a very dark brown color with just barely there ruby hightlights. Nice fluffy brown head that dissipated into a cap. The aroma is of coffee and high grade chocolate milk, some vanilla/rum spice that lets you know there is going to be some booze in there. Very big roasted coffee bean flavor hits hard and often right at the bell. Bitter sweet chocolate makes its presence known throughout with a touch of raisins in the end. Exceptional feel, thick and chewy, smoooth yet has a light prickly carbonation that breaks up the body. Finishes bitter from the strong roasted coffee flavor, alcohol is well hidden. Great coffee stout, excellent flavor and feel. It is heavy and has a high ABV so that would limit me to one but very nice. 735 charactersGmann, Feb 19, 2009
4.41/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle into Sam Adams Lager glass.
Pours opaque black with a dense, rocky 1.5 finger head that doesn't want to go away. Eventually, and with much lacing, settles into a thick, dense cap. I can't imagine this beer looking any better if it were shooting off fireworks.
Nose is espresso, very roasty, bit of acidity; underneath, bit of cocoa, smooth. 
Taste is lots of espresso - full flavored and smooth up front, with a beautiful, rich cocoa note underneath, fading to a lasting dry, espresso bitterness. Almost smoky. Superbly balanced between the clear espresso and rich cocoa notes. A green, almost vegetal note from the coffee beans is the only thing between this and a perfect score - I've gotten the same taste from eating dark chocolate covered coffee beans before. That's almost a perfect analogy for what's going on with this beer.
Mouthfeel is fairly thick, but with a light, sharp carbonation. Pretty smooth overall. Delicious, even for a non coffee-drinker like myself. Very, very good. 1,001 charactersJohnQVegas, Feb 17, 2009

A - Beautiful shiny black color, with light brown head. It takes a long time for this to dissipate. 
S - Intense coffee beans, almost like burnt coffee grounds, actually. Not bad.
T - A little banana to begin with, then definitely coffee, coffee, coffee.
M - Nice and smooth, and a bit chewy for the first few sips. It does taste a bit like cold coffee, really.
D - This one's definitely a treat, and if it weren't my last bottle, I'd definitely be asking for round 2. 617 charactersraoulduke37, Feb 17, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: the pour was very nice and filled with deep reds, crimson, browns, and maybe some burgundy hues. Once settled in the glass a collective "black" color could be claimed. The pour produced a soft brown sugar colored head, fizzy at best and quick to dissipate. The inner walls of the glass contained a few erratic splashes of lace. Overall a good look
S: smells of deep, roasted, dark malts and coffee, mostly coffee. Coffee beans are of the strong bitter oily variety. They say Fair Trade Coffee...nice. I think I am gonna love it!
T: chockfull of coffee! As my nose mentioned before; bitter, roasted, and oily coffee. This has to be, to date, the most java based beer I have ever had. What makes things nice is it has a delicate sweet cream character, or sugary caffè latte based touch. Malts are deeply roasted and a touch on the burnt side, from what I can tell. If you love coffee, as do I, you owe it to yourself to try this and will be flown to paradise!
M: when I poured this brew I noticed that it had lighter dimensions. The body is a nice creamy and hearty mild, but not near some other stouts I have had. The body is a notch above thumbs up!
D: even though I am head over heels for this coffee bomb of a brew. I must add that it has a single goal and lacks in overall complexity. It is a stretch to include much else in this brew but...you guessed it, coffee! Oh yea, where's the alcohol???
I still give it high marks for the "bean" boldness that it puts forth. I really am floored by this brew! 1,511 charactersMagpie14, Feb 17, 2009
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thank you Bobby91w for this bottle!
Pours a nice black with an extremely thick foamy head that sticks around a while, leaving trails wherever it dies down.
Scent is prominent roasted coffee with hints of chocolate and cream in the background. Very appetizing and I can't wait to take a sip.
Taste is coffee coffee coffee, and quality roast at that, possibly more toward the bitter side of espresso. The hints of chocolate and other imperial staples are present, but this is coffee out front first and foremost. Amazing that they really mask the alcohol.
Mouth is thin/med bodied and med carbonation. Perhaps prefer my impys to be a little thicker but it may have been too much with that heavy espresso profile.
Drinkability is high, this is a quality coffee brew. If you don't like coffee brews, this won't be your converter, but if you do, it doesn't get much better. 873 characterssonicdescent, Feb 10, 2009
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Been waiting to try this guy for quite some time. Pours like a big stout should without as much head as I might like or expect. Some light shows through when held to a bright lamp. 
Scent is sweet and deep but not giving up any secrets as to what's in store.
The flavor is a big punch of surprise after the scent. Big, upfront coffee flavor with a texture that kinda reminds me of a good grape juice. Gives it a kind of red wine quality. Bitter dark chocolate with a molasses sweetness.
Very nice. Not hitting me as best in the world caliber but I wouldn't kick this out of bed... or out of my glass. 600 charactersommegangpbr, Feb 07, 2009
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4S = Very strong, rich dark coffee aromas with a little dark chocolate in the background.
T = Taste was all top-notch coffee upfront with a hint of caramel and chocolate in the middle and end. The finish was all roasted coffee goodness. Alcohol was truly hidden.
MF = Very thick and full bodied with low carbonation. Silky smooth and creamy.
Overall, the coffee flavors took the spotlight on this one. This had the most coffee flavor of any beer that I've had to date. Exceptional and easy to drink. Highly recommended. 521 charactersRiverwarrior, Feb 06, 2009

A: Pours dark black with light khaki colored head and lots of lacing on the glass. Almost looks like a guiness.
S: Mostly coffee smell with maybe a slight bit of chocolate that i could even be imagining. Some roasted malts.
T: Super coffee flavored...roast and bitter...tastes better as it warms.
M: Thick like an imperial stout should be
D: Pretty drinkable for the style...alcohol is well hidden.
Just a little too much coffee to keep me wanting to drink more and more of this. 543 charactersdukedevil0, Feb 06, 2009
4.13/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into a flute. This beer pours like black motor oil and is opaque when held to the light. A 2 + inch head forms that is persistent with extensive lacing.
The aroma is complex with notes of chocolate malts and coffee, but also dirt and leather. It was quite unique to me because this was the second time I had it and it seemed a little different than my previous experience.
The taste mimicked the aroma with chocolate malt, coffee, but seemed to overwhelm me with the earthy, dirt components. Hops is hidden in the aroma and taste, but minimally present.
The mouthfeel was on the medium-side of heavy bodied. There is a high level of carbonation with a bitter feeling that lingers on the tongue. It is quite smooth and the alcohol is barely noticeable.
Overall, this is a very drinkable beer and I think the complexity to the taste and aroma make it a very interesting beverage to have. I will hopefully get to enjoy it again in the near future. 969 charactersSykDoc, Feb 04, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 511.5 oz. bottle poured into a snifter.
A-Black beer. Black, black, and more black. Dark. Topped with a luscious brown head, moderate retention. The head reduced down to sparse bubbles, but continued to reappear with a slight swirl throughout my enjoyment of this brew.
S-Raisins and dark fruity esters. Coffee (duh!) runs away with this aroma... sooo much coffee, while still melding in well with a rich roasted malt aroma. A very full-flavored aroma overall.
T-Coffee is present and assertive, but it blends in well with the roasty black malt characteristics. Chocolates mingle well with rainy dried fruit flavors. A coffee bitterness is strong and pleasant, coupled with some hop bitterness underneath it all. This beer is very rich, with flavors flowing and playing off of eah other.
M-moderate carbonation enhances this full-bodied stout. Velvety feel moving over my tongue. It feels overly indulgent.
D-A very tasty beer, with a strong coffee character, but not even close to drowning out the other flavors. Exquisite! 1,028 charactersCHSLBrew, Feb 03, 2009
4.44/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 311.5oz. bottle poured into broad mouth glass
Appearance: Black. Black as the black sweatshirt I am wearing. Minimal tan head that dissipated quickly but decent lacing. I don't know for sure but I'm guessing this bottle is at least a year old because my local liquor store doesn't get this is all the time and they've had it on the shelves for a while.
Smell: The coffee is definitely there in a big way but there's a lot more chocolate aroma than I was expecting, a pleasant surprise. Alcohol is somewhat detectable through the smell. Smells magnificent.
Taste: I usually start reviewing after taking my first sip and keep sipping throughout my review but this one I had to take a second sip immediately. I already know this is a great beer and I've only had two sips. Ok, enough gushing. Coffee and chocolate are prominent but share the spotlight equally making each taste a delight. After that there is some bitter nut flavor, hazelnut perhaps. And finally it finishes with a decent amount of hop bitterness, bite, and surprisingly flavor. I don't know what kind of hops they use but you can taste the earthiness and very subtle fruitiness from them in the finish, which to me makes this beer not just good but great. 
Mouthfeel: Not overbearing but thick enough to meet style guidelines, very smooth.
Drinkability: High ABV but it's so damn delicious I would buy this in sixers if it was offered.
Overall: I put off trying this one for a while and now I have no idea why. This is an amazing imperial stout. I think coffee makes a nice addition to any brown, porter, or stout but in an imperial stout it might be the best because of the way it balances out the sweet malts. This is a must try and it's completely understandable 1,735 charactersoptiontwo, Feb 02, 2009
4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a tulip glass, a rich coffee black body, with a dark brown head. Head was about 2 fingers and had great retention, slapping the upper lip with great suddiness on every sip. Aroma is a big, buttery coffee. Unlike most stouts, this didn't have that burnt smell to it - quite elegant.
Taste is very luscious, very similar to coffee milk. Very little bitterness, with some hints of butter and dark fruit. Slight alcohol finish.. but is very masked and is more of a warming agent. Brew is very smooth, velvety feel.
Well this one didn't let me down. Certainly delivered on all fronts. Sweet, but not too sweet. Definitely recommend this. 646 charactersbigkahunas4, Feb 02, 2009

Pours out of the bottle as a thick dark brown brew. Slight ruby tinges around the edges. A massive dark sandy head forms and doesn't go anywhere for a long time. The head slowly condenses into a dark dense bottom with a fluffy crest of light tan.
Nose is great, with ample dark, bitter chocolate dominating. Burnt malts weave with hints of coffee. Some ethanol enters into the mix upon warming.
First sip is astringent coffee flavor and malts and dense chocolate like a gluten-free cake. Lingering acidic coffee flavors.
Mouthfeel is creamy and slightly milky.
Overall quite good, but over-rated. 734 charactersshivtim, Jan 31, 2009

A pet peeve of mine is getting a nice craft brew that comes in a twist top. Worst part was opening my last 22oz which was a twistie. I mean, if you brew craft beer, you more than likely home brewed at some point. If you home brew, you know you keep your bottles. So craft brewers, please oh please, no more twisties!!
/rant
Oil slick baclk black hole light muncher. WHoa thats a lot of head. Maybe it was my anxious pour. Solid and think mocha head. I bet I could lay a quarter on this. Lacing present. All looks great.
Wow. Deep, deep malt. Prolly the darkest ive smelt. Alcohol with some twist, cant make it out. Light, but rich espresso smell, no real sweet flavor which is nice. Smells ridiculously rich. Im getting anxious
My oh my. Now thats some coffee. Coffee, coffee, coffee. Malt, alcohol, and some rum raisin present. Alcohol is very warmimg. I made sure to have this at a solid temp of 50F and its paying off. Finishing hops, slight stoutish dry finish. Amazing
BTW ... the head ... still there.
Not perfectly balanced. Might be a little over the top alchol bite for the body. Sits well, great carbonation. Flavor lasting.
I could see some folks thinking the coffee is too much. Maybe it is, but I tell you, this beer is amazing. One of a kind in my book. I want more.
Ok, now its time to hit the cellar for marvins box!

4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 411.2oz bottle into a regular snifter for maximum scent possibility. Not sure the date on this but it could not be that old.
A- Dieu Du Ciel's Peche Mortel is an extremely dark and black beer and has a thickness to it as seen coming out of the bottle. As it coats the glass a nice one inch dark tan to brown comes up creating a nice cap that eventually fades. Some lines of lace but nothing special.
S- A nice amount of fair trade coffee is in the forefront with the all to regular (for this style) dark chocolate mix. I'm really digging the smell of the coffee blend used as it's quite pungent and inviting. Also getting the roasted malt bill and a touch of hops to round out a great nose. Very rich and complex.
T- The taste of rich roasted coffee hit me first with the kona beans working their magic. The roastiness of this stout is what set's it apart from other attempts at this style. Rich dark chocolate follows the fair trade coffee creating a tight bond with some vanilla aspects. Some cocco powder supplimenting the chocolate. Not as much caramel presence as expected and would probably distract from the taste. Also getting some bittering effects from the hops used and a burnt feeling.
M- Extremely cramy and smooth in nature for being such a huge stout at 9.5%. This mouthfeel improves vastly with warming so I wait 15 minutes before even pouring. Peche Mortel coats the mouth ever so gently leaving a somewhat warming sensation with just a bit of bitterness. No alcohol detected but a whole lot of sweetness along with rich coffee tones stick around. 
D- Sip, Savor, Enjoy! This one is meant to be sipped to really grasp all that it has to offer as the main flavors come out of hibernation with warming. I would have two bottles of this no problem if it was not so damn expensive. Bitterness may deter other's but i'm game. Would love to try this on tap. 
I've had a lot of high rated coffee stouts and this one takes the cake easily, without a doubt. 1,970 charactersBARFLYB, Jan 30, 2009

Smells of bittersweet chocolate,plums, dark coffee, roasted malts. Smells a lot like an expresso.
Starts off with a dark coffe flavor followed by a semi bittesweet dark chocolate with a minimal hop bitterness. 
Full flavored beer with a decent amount of carbonation, leaves a bitter aftertaste.
I could not manage to drink more then one of these. Its a little to bitter for my taste though. 442 characterstr4nc3d, Jan 30, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I loved this beer. A nice smooth black pour with a head of tinted cream on top. One of the best (if not the best) coffee/chocolate tasting stouts I've have had. I love coffee stouts but when I tasted this one, all others (except for Founders Breakfast) left my mind. A strong mocha espresso aroma with a hint of alcohol. The flavor was very rich espresso with chocolate waves and a bit of bitterness. I was amazed at how easy it was to drink considering the ABV. I will be keeping the other two bottles in my cellar for awhile!! This is a must try for every stout lover!!

Smell: Cafe Latte All The Way! Just a slightly milky creamy coffee aroma that entices you to take a sip :)
Taste: Well blended coffee stout. The coffee is never unnoticed but not overpowering either. I'm not even a coffee drinker and I love this stuff. Then again the bottle has been in my fridge for about 3 months so maybe I'm not having the freshest sample. 
Mouthfeel: Not very heavy and well carbonated. I'm happy this one wasn't thick or syrupy. 
Drinkability: Easy to down this brew although I wouldn't recommend drinking too many as too much caffeine is a bad thing. Especially when consumed in a mixed form with a depressant.

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this on a whim (pardon my ignorance) at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a jet black color, with a thin, off-white colored head. A rather unassuming appearance to the forthcoming smell and taste. The aroma is full on nasal assault of coffee, I think there is some chocolate in there, but this thing is loaded on the coffee. It smells delicious, and tastes equally so. The strong coffee flavor tastes so amazing, with a slight caramel & chocolate background. You'd never know how strong this imperial stout is by the taste, the coffee & malt flavor is almost all you taste. It now takes the cake for me on coffee stouts. I have had many versions, and thought I had a favorite, but this now wins hands down. This stout also goes down rather easy, not too thick or strong. Really, a perfect balance.
Edit* Upon a second tasting against Founders Breakfast Stout, I am further strengthened in my opinion on the high quality of this coffee stout. It is truly a exemplary brew. 968 charactersbhalter8, Jan 25, 2009
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A. Jet black with soft fluffy foam that is 1/2" tall and holds its own with any other beers retention. The lacing looks like tan snow sliding down a windshield. 
S Coffee, raisins, leather, currants, chocolate, and booze. 
T. The first taste is of coffee, then the hops kick in that attempt to balance this huge malt-bomb. Some roast and chocolate are nicely blended in the middle, but the its quite bitter which is also enhanced by the astrigency of the coffee. Just a little bit too much for this to have a better score from me. It is very complex and adds warmth deep down from the high ABV. 
M. Thick and creamy in the mouth and high carbonation for style. I actually like higher carbonation in all of my beers so this is nice. 
D. I really think I could session this 9.5% RIS with no problem. No, seriously. 816 charactersMMAJYK, Jan 20, 2009
4.87/5  rDev +10.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a solid opaque black color with a nice, frothy creamed coffee colored head and left some generous sheets of lacing down the glass. I've been enjoying several coffee stouts as of late, and this one has one of, if not THE best coffee noses I've come across so far. The aroma is all espresso back up by some light chocolate, lots of roasty notes and some alcohol. Upon my first taste, my first words were, "Oh My God!" This beer is rich in complex coffee goodness. It tastes exactly like those chocolate covered espresso bean treats. Flavor weaves in and out of chocolaty goodness and strong, bitter roasted coffee. This is easily the best coffee stout I've ever tasted. It's roasty, toasty, chocolaty, coffee goodness that just doesn't stop. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, incredibly smooth despite the large amounts of coffee and the bitterness. Alcohol is very well hidden and alcohol is barely noticeable. It's just way too easy to drink for it's strength in flavor and alcohol, which is dangerous considering the ABV. This beer is just fantastic. I'm glad I picked up two bottles, as one will surely makes it's way into the cellar area of my basement. Coffee stouts, or any stout for that matter, just don't get any better than this. SEEK THIS OUT. 1,256 charactersKeefD, Jan 20, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a bottle gotten via trade from jjazz. 
A: A deep black color with a nice one finger light brown head. Beer pours thick and leaves nice glass lacing.
S: Wow, so complex. Massive amounts of coffee and dark bitter chocolate. A hint of hops is detected.
T: Again, what a complex beer. I ran through a whole gamut of flavors. It starts with coffee but an almost burnt coffee and even some espresso and maybe charcoal or tar. I then get a real nice bitter chocolate flavor but not real sweet, it stays creamy and smooth. Towards the finish I pick up a hint of some vanilla and a touch of hops. Very nice, no scratch that, it's excellent.
M: Full and coating with a trace of alcohol but not overly so as one would think. Real bitter finish that is wonderful.
D: Not bad for a high abv beer. I could put down 2 if I had them, they are real drinkable.
Overall an exceptional beer that was just fabulous and oh so complex. Wow, I'll need some more of this. Excellent. 975 charactersKadonny, Jan 19, 2009

The aroma was dominated by the smell of coffee with chocolate also coming through. The taste was similar and balanced well and also had a bit of a nutty taste. Mouthfeel was proper for a stout. Drinkability was high for a beer of this abv. 330 charactersbiggmike, Jan 17, 2009
4.03/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Stumbled upon this beer at Belmont Party Supply in Dayton, OH. Picked it up due to it being so highly rated right here on BA.
Pours jet flippin black with caramel head. Excellent lacing as this beer disappears.
Smells of coffee, black coffee. No cream or sugar in it. BLACK COFFEE!
Tasts of roasted malts with a hint of creaminess. Aftertaste goes to coffee.
The mouthfeel is thick, just like a Imp. Stout should be.
Definitely not a session beer but extremely drinkable. 476 characterstburkhart, Jan 16, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours an extremely dark brown with a big, finely bubbled, brown head with excellent retention; that leaves rings as you slowly sip it down. Smell is very interesting: aromas of stale coffee (which is so interesting that I don't consider it a bad thing), dark chocolate, and burnt wood. Fascinating taste: roasted coffee loud and clear (but that was expected and isn't necessarily an endorsement), dark chocolate truffles, smoke and charry bitterness - I love it. Full-bodied but perfectly carbonated. For 4 dollars for an 11.5 oz bottle I was hoping for this kind of quality and I'm relieved that it delivered. I will definitely buy this one again and show it to friends. One of the most interesting stouts I've ever had. 721 charactersdroomyster, Jan 14, 2009

Pours pretty much black with a large tan head. Moderate carbonation. Aroma is pretty big milky cocoa, malts, oaky and slightly ashy. Flavor is bitter cocoa, light hops, molasses. The mouthfeel is dry, chalky and bitter, and I love it like that. This one was well worth the wait. Now I have to hoard my three remaining bottles. 446 charactersbrewbucker, Jan 14, 2009
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Aroma is absolutely magnificent - like unsweetened chocolate with an undertone of rich roast coffee. It pours like motor oil and comes out opaque sable, just a shade this side of black, with a thick, fine, persistent tan head. Fabulous flavor is chocolaty but not sweet, with tones of coffee and smoke, nutty hints, and a touch of hops. Texture is tingly and lively so it practically dances down the esophagus. Strongly recommended, especially to Stouties. 456 charactersCyberkedi, Jan 13, 2009
4.54/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5341 mL bottle, courtesy of DoubleJ, thanks Jon,
A: Pours a dark brown with a medium cap of literal brown head. Good lacing.
S: Smells like a strong cup of coffee, great smell, nothing more to say.
T: Has all the good flavours of coffee without being overly bitter. The coffee mixes well with the roasted malt, no burnt flavours. Dark chocolate and a light hop characteristic bitterness in the finish.
M: Does not have a huge, thick body, but is real smooth and creamy. The lighter mouthfeel gives it excellent drinkability for its size and style.
D: This is just straight up good beer out of Montreal, Canada. If you don't like it there's something wrong with you. Quite deserving of its top 100 status, a treat. 717 charactersHalcyondays, Jan 12, 2009

Smell: In a word - espresso earthiness, with hints of chocolate and toffee, and dark fudge.
Taste: Smooth, not harsh or bitter, coffee and espresso, with a touch of chocolate and caramel malt. It seems to be an essential part of beer, unlike other stouts where it seems imposed. Too many coffee beers taste of burnt coffee and used grinds, this one does not.
Mouthfeel: Smooth, nice carbonation. 
Drinkability: Best coffee beer I have had. 570 characterscraytonic, Jan 12, 2009
3.06/5  rDev -30.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 311.5 oz shoulder bottle from Vidalia in Lansdale (before it closed). Purchased for around $6. Split the bottle with a friend.
Pours a pretty sludgy looking black with a cocoa powder colored head that sported fairly good retention and some nice lacing. Good looking stout.
Smell was mostly burnt dark malts and alcohol. Not bad, but I think they forgot to put the coffee in mine.
No coffee taste either. Tasted like burnt malts, faint chocolate and booze. Not really much else going on. My friend didn't taste any coffee either.
Mouthfeel was fairly rich, viscous, medium low carbonation. A bit of a burn from the alcohol.
Drinkability is just average. Not exactly undrinkable but it certainly didn't make me want to drink another. This one really didn't live up to its reputation. I wish I had tried it when it was more fresh, but it has been in a fridge since I bought it. We were so disappointed that we had to make some coffee afterwards to make up for the disappointment. I have another bottle in my cellar and I am regretting shelling out the money for it. The Derniere and Route de Espice were much better. Maybe I can trade my second bottle to somebody that would enjoy it more. 1,190 characterswheelinshirt, Jan 11, 2009

A - What you want from a RIS. Thick and pitch black that settles with a milk chocolate head which leaves a web.
S - Just like my double espresso with a packet of raw sugar. 
T - More black coffee, I'd be damned if this doesn't taste like the carbonated version of what I drink in the morning.

4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a US tumbler pint glass. 
A: The beer is a deep dark brown color, with a large light brown head that fades very slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma is of strong roasted coffee, dark malts, some dark chocolate and a faint touch of alcohol.
T: The taste as expected is very malty and full of black coffee along with some creamy chocolate. It's not as intensely sweet as some other big stouts. There's not much of a hops presence but it's really not needed in this type of beer as it retains a good balance without it. The alcohol is very well-disguised. The after-taste is slightly sweet.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium-to-heavy body, medium carbonation, finish is very clean for the style.
D: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easily, slightly filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is definitely one of the better coffee-flavored beer that I've had. It's certainly one that is worth sticking with for a long time. 997 charactersTheManiacalOne, Jan 09, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I purchased this single bottle at State Line Liquors in Elkton Md. Poured chilled into my snifter.
A - Opaque, black w/ a med tan band of tightly beaded foam. The surface is wavy from a somewhat hard pour. The had becomes lace rapidly as the cap condenses. A beautiful tan like crema atop an espresso shot. A mocha would envy the appearance of this stout in the glass.
S - The odor of strong black coffee and yeast rise to my nostrils. The smell is like an espresso shot in intensity w/ raw sugar generously added. The aroma is malty and not overly so as the coffee aromas really stand out w/ nicely roasted bean quality and subtle spiced scents - possibly an earthy hop aroma somewhere in there to boot.
M - Very smooth at 1st, then the feel gets roasty and dry. The creamy oily texture unravels to a spiced and slightly alcoholic texture - a bit like coffee's astringency toward the end of the cup. The texture has an almost herbal/mildly medicinal quality.
T - the taste is biiter cocoa and tinges of anise w/ a cocoa covered espresso bean flavor. The malt pushes the roasted beans bitterness in the flavor. There is subtle dark malt in the taste and fruit w/ plum-like essence and slight elements of black pepper. A hint of molasses and bready yeast combine to make a dessert-like taste which at times tastes like coffee mousse and other moments seems like a smore w/ extremely dark chocolate and coffee soaked marshmallows. The flavors linger w/ both sweet and bitter attributes well into the next taste. A great quality to have when the beer tastes this darn good.
 D - The drinkability is top notch - I like the dry approach w/ the beans adding more bitterness and there is less sweetened coffee taste - more or less good if you like your coffee w/out the sugar this will suit you. Peche Mortel has more spice and java than most + yet still a great Imperial stout underneath it all. 1,894 charactersSlatetank, Jan 09, 2009

dark, roasted, acrid, charcoal aromas emanate from the beer. I very very minor downfall comes about that a faint malt aroma linger between coffee aromas. 
sweet almost bready malt character clings to an eye awakening fresh pot of coffee taste. no detectable hop flavor but a bitterness protrudes through layers of sweet malt and dark roasted coffee. 
boarderline thick almost viscous put the mouthfeel in a category that i would call a RIS. possibly due to lower attenuation, but i really don't mind, this beer is neither cloying or too sweet, it is however a complete experience. 728 charactersJettanbass9, Jan 05, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A big thankyou to Maximum12 for sending me this brew in the BA Secret Santa '08 BIF. Served this at nearly cellar temperature, in a snifter, from an 11.5 ounce bottle. I've been wanting to try this for sometime now. 
Appearance: Peche Mortel pours out a thick looking, spent motor oil black that not a single ray of light could pass through. A rather easy pour resulted in about two fingers of fluffy, coffee brown colored head. Head had pretty good retention, slowly faded into a thick gob of foam that sat atop the black mass of beer. Each sip left ring after ring of soapy tan lace behind on the glass.
Smell: This beer has a thick, full nose on it. Coffee is the big powerhouse in the nose. Nice roasty/toasty coffee and malt aromas. Some definite hints of chocolate, toffee and black licorice. Also haze a spicey booziness. Awesome nose on this beer.
Taste: Great flavor as well. Strong, roasted black coffee is matched up with some sweet roasted malt. Coffee leaves a mellow bitterness behind. There is a slight hoppiness that is pretty well hidden behind all of the other flavors. Spicey black licorice, with some faint chocolate and wood. Small touches of toffee are in there as well. Finishes with a coffee bitterness that is overtaken by a shot of booze and some hops. Quite a complex yet smooth flavor.
Mouthfeel: Smooth, silky, full bodied mouthfeel. Almost thick and creamy. The level of carbonation is just about perfect. 
Drinkability: Pretty drinkable for such a big stout. This one is a sipper for me. I'm pretty impressed with this beer. 1,560 charactersjaxon53, Jan 04, 2009

Giant pour. Jeezers. I thought I was pouring it slow but the head it just unstoppable big and soapy brown atop an almost perfectly opaque body.
Smells of very strong coffee and wet stout. I say wet because it smells like the planar opposite of a dry stout--the malt doesn't leave the bitter taste on the back of your tongue. Instead, it hits up front. Same with the hops, which taste more American than European. 
Tastes like soft, smooth chocolate up front, raw porter in the back, some coffee in the middle, and then an excellent aftertaste that's a combination of green west coast hops and dark, black coffee. 
Excellent combination, very nicely balanced. 747 charactersmynie, Jan 01, 2009
4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Inky solid, deep brown color, bordering on black. Head is taupe, tinted with warm brown. The lace is the nice tight sheety looking kind and the retention is pleasantly reminiscent of a frothy cup of french pressed coffee. Aroma is quite tasty in my nose. Rich roasty, toasty coffee, bittersweet chocolate, creamy sugary cocoa and caramel. Simple aromas that are very pleasant in their subtle, smooth combination. I like the taste a lot also. It begins with lactic milkiness that weaves into earthy roast coffee, cocoa and velvety chocolate. The texture is thickly smooth yet slick. Drinkable chocolate comes to mind. The carbonation is spot on as well.
A pleasure to consume. 676 characterstastybeer, Dec 30, 2008

Nice sized chocolate colored head with good retention and sheets of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is of sweet, dark chocolate and fresh roasted coffee. 
Taste is more of the same as the aroma. Loads of fresh coffee here. There is a nice roasted bitterness from the coffee, along with a some chocolately sweetness. I would prefer a touch more viscosity in the mouthfeel, but really that is nitpicking. No sign of the nearly 10% ABV in this beer. 
By far the best coffee stout I've had, and one of the best beers I've had overall. Here is a beer that lives up to its hype. Exceptional. 663 charactershckyfn9999, Dec 26, 2008
3.88/5  rDev -11.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2.5Served from a bottle looking exactly like the one pictured here into my clean, clear Samuel Smith pint. No observable "best buy" date but I don't really think that it matters. I bought it a few weeks ago at Rozi's Wine house in Lakewood, Ohio for $5.99 for the 12 oz. bottle.
A Jet black ink body with actually a medium to DARK brown head. This is one mean looking beer. It poured in very thick indeed and its head stayed around for at least 3 minutes, taking its good sweet time to dissipate. In fact, it has been about 4 minutes since pouring and it is still hanging on.
S Ineteresting. First impressions are of a freshly opened package of coffee...French Roast. Repeated smells reveal a musty sense that I do not really like. It is not unlike smelling fresh coffee for too long and starting to get some bitterness in the smell.
T/M This might be the deepest, darkest, bad attitude stout that I have had. Certainly the dark coffee smell carries over into the taste as does that musty smell but there is a nice syrupy feel that carries the taste on for a bit. Suprisingly, the after taste is limited to about one minute and I am left with only a hint of the taste. Suprisingly since it is such a big beer I guess I expected the thickness to linger much longer than it does.
D I really do not think that stouts (and especially Imperial Stouts) are supposed to be particularly drinkable and this is no exception. IMO it is to be enjoyed one at a time (and certainly one per night as far as I am going to be doing).
Notes: A great, big badass stout with obvious coffee smells, tastes. 1,587 charactersadamette, Dec 23, 2008
3.85/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This one pours out black with a giant, sticky brown head. The head falls back slowly, and is gone by the time you finish. You get decent lacing, as much as is expected from bottle-conditioned beers. The smell is coffee, but its not quite as coffee rich as some other similarly styled beers. You get a note of the roasted flavor, like the soy sauce flavor that accompanies the darkest of malts. The taste is really great. The backbone for many coffee beers is usually a bit sweeter, but this one is dark and roasty. Very interesting. You get the bitterness shining through, but there's also a very silky feeling to it. I'm a bit afraid that without the coffee you would get all soy sauce without the saltiness. But it's a flavor that I enjoy (though I doubt most other people would actually like it). You get quite a complex burst of flavors, that make you want to sit around and think about it. There's coffee and bittersweet malts, and the roasted flavors, all with a kick of silkiness, and you always want the next drink. I don't think this is as good as some other coffee stouts, but it's still good. I can't say I would buy cases of this and continue drinking it (which is quite normal for in my case most of the stronger stouts), but the likelihood of me finding it over and over again is rare enough that I would probably buy it if I see it again. 1,353 characterstaylorhamrick, Dec 23, 2008

4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A great looking stout. Black as a starless night in the Darkness goblet. A nice tan coloured head, a finger thick (would have been more except the volume of the glass caused me to take it easy at the end of the pour) with excellent retention. Nice, sticky, thin sheets of lace. This is a beautiful looking brew.
A nice nose on this one too. Creamy nougat, roasted malts, dark roasted coffee, a hint of anise, and earthy hops.
Wow, this is a tasty and incredibly rich brew. Creamy caramel nougat meets a good dose of earthy, rich dark roast coffee. Roasted malts hint at bittersweet chocolate and a whisp of smoke. A hint of anise appears near the finish before the earthy hops reminiscent of decaying leaves are revealed.
This is big on coffee as well as a rich, nougaty accompaniment. Almost full bodied and quite mildly carbonated, as it should be. Almost more coffee than roasted malts, which is surprising, but quite satisfying to this coffee lover. A very well crafted brew, with an interesting balance that is slightly coffee forward.
This is going down pretty easy considering just how big this beer is. A great treat on this bitter, windy winter night. I could knock a few of these back quite easily in one sitting, although the alcohol would catch up to me sooner rather than later. It does reveal itself with a palate and belly warming quality that is just what this bag of bones needs on this frigid winter solstice. Highly recommended for fans of coffee stouts. Im glad i have a few more bottles of this one to enjoy later when the mood strikes. It wont be too long. 1,582 charactersdemcorhip, Dec 22, 2008

4.83/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to rustydiamond for this one on a recent trade. I've been looking forward to trying this for a long time but never seemed to be able to get it. On a cold San Diego night, poured into my standard tasting glass. 
Perfect pour, honestly. I am instantly excited when it hits the glass, great color, great thickness, superb head retention (been in my glass now for almost 45 minutes and still coating). 
Big coffee smell, almost like the place I stop every morning on my way to work. Like a place that roasts their own coffee, sharp almost espresso like darkness. Not sure what coffee was used, but not your wimpy Starbucks fare. 
In the height of stout season, I have been moving through some serious heavyweights. As good as some of the greatest imperials are, this beer has become my new favorite stout. I think what clinches it is the excellent balance. You can expect the coffee up front, but thats exactly what it is. Upfront coffee, but then mellows out perfectly on the palate and reveals deeper flavors. I wont pinpoint, but what comes through is perfectly complementary. 
Not too thick. I would say somewhere in the vicinity of 50 weight. No idea at all what that means. Just imagine that it is thick enough to coat the mouth, but not to the point where it feels syrupy. 
I wish I had another. I will definitely be seeking this out as I would like to have two back to back. Slowly of course given the strength, but it is just that enjoyable that I need more to satisfy the craving. 
Awesome. Really a great beer. I expected good, but not to take the front spot on my list of favorite stouts. Thanks again to trading, one of the most enjoyable things I have gotten into. 1,691 charactersgoodspeed94, Dec 21, 2008

Roasted coffee beans dominate the palate with a nice hop bitterness in the finish. Thick and smooth texture. Alcohol is nicely balanced.
This is a fine coffee stout. However, I find it somewhat one-note with regard to the flavors. Fantastic appearance, aroma, texture and alcohol balance, but the flavors are slightly short of my expectations. Strong roasted malt and coffee flavors, but it mostly stops there. 536 charactersTheDoorman, Dec 20, 2008
4.08/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Reviewed on 6/15/08. Bottle. Pours black with a thick tan head that persists somewhat. Aroma of coffee, roasted and sweet malt. Aroma is weak (not as in not strong, just not very rich and robust). However, the flavor is a bit richer: lots and lots of burnt coffee (even stronger than in the aroma), bitter roasted malt, and peanut brittle. Strong, thick mouthfeel for a 9.5%. Not my favorite coffee stout (Beer Geek Breakfast is more balanced, less bitter and roasted), but still quite enjoyable and a very interesting beer to drink. Definitely try this one, it is quite unique!

4.57/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours nearly opaque, and black by all appearances. Head is medium brown and doesn't last long.
Nose is chocked full of dark chocolate, 3 Muskateers nougat, and espresso beans.
Palate has more dark roasted coffee, espresso or Vienna roast perhaps, bittersweet chocolate, and some roasty malt flavors. Hops are there but you can't get past the joy of the dark roasted coffee flavors.
Great example of the style. Few coffee stouts pull off this dark roast profile so well. 472 charactersyemenmocha, Dec 19, 2008

A - Pours opaque black. Huge 3-finger brown head has insane staying power. Thick, chunky lacing is left behind, with a fluffy cap and thick collar. Pretty!
S - Nose starts with sweet, caramelly espresso. Toffee, chocolate, fig, and smoke come through as well.
T - Huge espresso, followed by caramel, toffee, and smoke. Slightly sweet, but balanced by roasty bitterness. Light alcohol burn.
M - Soft and creamy, medium full.
D - The alcohol brings it down a notch, but I keep wanting to go back for more.
Absolutely delicious and deserving of the accolades. 626 characters0110x011, Dec 18, 2008

Smell is of cocoa, espresso, caramel, ripe dark fruit, black grapes, and vanilla cream.
Taste is of the aromas with a plum flavor thrown into the mix of the cocoa, and wonderfully brewed espresso, and brown sugar.
Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy, with mild mocha bitterness coming through.

3.73/5  rDev -15.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5As a coffee industry professional, beer's like this one are tough for me to evaluate. 
As a beer, this is good enough I suppose. The flavors mesh nicely, the finish evolves and shows new complexities, and the overall palate impression is a good one.
With that said...the coffee flavor is not at all what I was hoping for. Lots of dark roastiness, but little of the nuance and characteristic aromas that I love to find in my favorite coffees. I suppose that would be a bit much to ask for from a beer; the delicate flavor of good coffee is incredibly unstable, and perhaps there is no way preserve it in a finished beer.
This is a style I'll be staying away from in the future. 679 charactersjjazz, Dec 15, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +13%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 511.5 oz/~340mL bottle poured into a nonic glass
A - an inky black mess, as can be expected for this style of beer. The head was slightly lighter than dark brown, 2.5cm in height, and it dissipated rather quickly a small foamy halo.
S - coffee, dark chocolate, coffee, and some coffee. The chocolate/coffee aroma provides a nice mocha-like scent heretofore unsmelled in similar brews.
T - prior to an explosion of coffee flavor, there's something sweet, fruity, and barely there...I'm thinking banana. It disappears as the beer warms. The coffee is followed by a roasty dark chocolate flavor which cascades into a bitter ending complete with a touch (and I mean a touch) of alcohol. The alcohol is barely noticeable, and for a Imperial Coffee Stout, this beer is not as one dimensional as I thought it would be.
M - thick, nearly creamy as a good Imp. Stout should be, but it seemed to have a little too much carbonation. (I'm thinking on the mouthfeel scale, it would be a 4.8, but I didn't want to put a 4.5 because that would be subtracting too much for a minor imperfection.)
D - great, the alcohol is well hidden and the flavor, which is very strong, isn't that overpowering nor as one dimensional as some coffee stout and chocolate stouts can be.
One of the (if not the) greatest beer I've ever had the privilege to drink. 1,333 charactersbowersdm, Dec 14, 2008

Very nice roast coffee and roast malt aromas. Med/full bodied with a descent amount of small carbonation, not quite creamy. Coffee, coffee and some mocha or bakers chocolate, coffee bitters in the finish. A little bitey, but mellows nicely as it warms. No messin around, very good straigh forward, yet slightly different than the norm Imperial. More of a good java stout than a straight Imperial. Not quite a good as the Bell's or Southern Tier I've had. Still worth finding however. 572 charactersBung, Dec 11, 2008

4.01/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: 11.5 oz bottle into a snifter. 
A- Very deep mahogany, and completely opaque. Sturdy pour yields ~1 1/2 fingers of brown head, which settles slowly fades into a thin, incomplete cap.
S- Earthy, burned, alcohol infused coffee. Try as I might, I am unable to cull anything beyond this for description.
T- Sweet crispness on the front, with a bit of raisin/fig/cherry cordial. This sweetness seems to increase slightly as the drink warms. Finishes with a nice, bitter coffee/espresso taste. Alcohol heat on the back of the back of the tongue/ throat is distinct at the first drink, though not overwhelming, and decreases quite perceptibly throughout consumption.
M- Surprisingly crisp on the front of my tongue, with moderate/low carbonation. Finishes very creamy and smooth. Slight numbing effect on front/middle of tongue noted towards the end of my serving.
D- A nice slow sipper, though smooth and easy drinking enough for it's 9.5 % ABV to go down a bit quicker than you might wish....

4.21/5  rDev -4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured into my Lost Abbey tulip. Péché Mortel is black with a two finger, light brown head. The head lingers for 5 minutes, and thick lacing is all over the glass.
The aroma is dominated by coffee. I'm having a hard time detecting much else. Some roasted malt and bitter chocolate.
Taste is of bitter coffee. Tastes like a cold iced coffee with very understated alcohol flavor. Surprisingly bitter. The finish is long and bitter with a slight sweetness to it.
Full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is very good. I can't fault a beer for tasting like coffee when that's what was intended, but I've never been a big fan of coffee dominated imperial stouts. This seems more like coffee than like beer. I can definitely dig it and appreciate it for what it is though. 
That being said, I just realized it's getting late and that this beer probably has a lot of caffeine so I don't think I'll be finishing it. Damn...why did I open a coffee stout so late. 967 charactersHopHead84, Dec 08, 2008

The aroma and taste are full of sweet coffee - really nice blend with the other ingredients. Alcohol is hidden perfectly. This was more carbonated than most really good stouts I've had, but it was still really full-bodied. Straight 5s for me - one of the few best stouts I've ever had. 343 charactersprsguitarsr4me, Dec 06, 2008
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pitch black pour at exactly 55 dgrees. in a 14oz snifter, all space above the beer is filled by a dark tan head which sticks to the glass as it dissipates.
Coffee smell fills the air. Tough to identify much more than coffee on the nose, but in its defense, I am a touch stuffy. There's a little sweet malt.
First sip - coffee everywhere. This is the most coffee flavored beer I think I've ever had. That's good, but I've got to say, it's just a bit much. There's a nice bitterness - from hops or from the coffee? There's a little heat, but the alcohol is well hidden under the flavor. There's definitely some complexity here, a little nuttiness: walnuts. There's definitely some bitter chocolate as well.
The mouthfeel is smooth, but not very thick.
If you're a coffeehead, I imagine you could drink this one forever. I like coffee - good coffee - but I don't drink it very often.
I wish there was more complexity to this one. If speedway stout didn't come in 750's, I'd pour one to compare head to head, but I appreciate the complexity of the SS over this one. The bitterness, nuttiness, chocolate are all nice, but I have a hard time thinking I'm drinking anything other than an alcoholic cup of joe here. That said, SS is one of my favorite beers - and this one is *very* good.
Most people say not to age this one (coffee flavor will weaken) - but I think I may put 1 or 2 aside and see what I think in a year or two. I'd like to see the coffee die down just a bit and some malts come forward for some additional complexity. Fortunately, I was able to pick up a 6-pack.
This is a great one, but my expectations were high - and not quite met. 1,651 charactersjpiper, Dec 03, 2008
3.8/5  rDev -13.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - Pours jet black, small brown head.
S - Strong java aroma hits me before I even get my nose near the glass. As I move in for a closer smell, that is all I can pick up is a very strong java coffee bean aroma and a tiny hint of chocolate malt.
T - Along with the smell, a strong java taste and a slight hint of chocolate malts. The 9.5% is very well hidden. For all of the coffee stouts I've had, this one is strong on the java presence which I'm not a huge fan of. 
M - Medium carbonation keeps away that sticky palate.
D - Nice sipper here on a warm night, for coffee lovers. 582 charactersYesac, Nov 30, 2008

The smell is like chocolate and fresh ground coffee beans.what a great taste. Different than any stout I've had. A very complex rush of flavours washes over the palette. I'm not too good at describing these things but it's all roasted malt and dark chocolate with a soft bitter slightly burnt after taste. The alcohol definitely is there but doesn't overpower. A perfect beer for coming in out of the snow and sitting in front of the fireplace. Mmmmm. 528 charactersshamus, Nov 29, 2008

Taste is bold and creamy. Rich dark roast malts combine with distinct coffee flavors. Some bittersweet chocolate as well. Semi-sweet up front with a somewhat dry finish. Slight alcohol in the finish, too.
Mouthfeel is insanely creamy and chewy. Perfect match to the flavors. A nearly 10% ABV beer should not drink this easy. Incredibly smooth. 465 charactersbobbyc881, Nov 28, 2008

4.52/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: Poured from a 11.5 oz brown bottle into a large snifter. Label depicts A lady with snakes either wrapped around her head or possibly as hair? Medusa? Can't tell. No freshness date, but not too sure that matters. A twist off top, which I found interesting on a beer many people (myself included) are going to age.
Appearance: Pours with 1 1/2 fingers of almost brown head. This settles to a thin coating of foam with an island in the center. Decent lacing. The beer itself is absolutely opaque and seems to absorb light like a black hole. Looks to be more brown than black. A thick layer of well compacted sediment in the bottle.
Smell: Extremely strong smell in general, I can smell it well before I get my nose down to the glass. Notes of licorice, anise, chocolate, and bitter coffee all wrapped up with strong alcohol sweetness. This just smells like it is going to kick your ass.
Taste: Decent carbonation bite helps to deliver the flavor and prevent the cloying feeling so often present in big beers. An immediate slightly sweet chocolate malt flavor on the front of your tongue. Middle flavors of raisins and figs with a fairly mild roastiness. Finishes with a definite kick from the high ABV and warms you quickly. Slight hints of vanilla and cherries in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Average carbonation level, just right to cut through the bold flavors. Body is incredibly good, thick and viscous.
Drinkability: A big, bold, impressive beer that is meant to be sipped and savored. Well blended, with great body and a nice balancing carbonation. I look forward to slowly pulling these out of the cellar. 1,623 charactersbeveritt, Nov 25, 2008

4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured this 11.5 oz brown bottle into a Duvel glass. Difficult to discern but maybe notched 0 0? Created a very tall head which eventually faded to a lumpy film. The head was chocolate milkshake brown and the body was glossy jet black. Served about 50 degrees F. Happened to be listening to Arcade Fire (Canadian band) while drinking this Canadian beer on a cold night in Kentucky.
Smell was roasty, acrid, and chocolaty malts. Steel. Cocoa powder and fresh brewed coffee grounds. 
Taste reflected the aromas very well. Espresso beans. Some sweetness from the rich malts. There was a lingering dark chocolate and coffee bitterness that was never cloying. 
Mouthfeel was a bit numbing. Zing on the tongue from carbonation. Alcohol was well hidden. 749 charactersCresant, Nov 23, 2008

The taste is full of dark chocolate, coffee, graham cracker, and nuts. The finish is a nice lingering roasted malt bitterness. It is a lot like the aroma, but not quite as nuanced. The mouthfeel is wonderfully chewy with a silky texture, and low carbonation. Overall, this is one beautiful beer. I really appreciate how balanced this is for an Imperial Stout. I like how all of the gorgeous malt flavors are allowed to express themselves without tons of hops getting in the way. I would love to have this available in my area. 756 charactersKarlHungus, Nov 20, 2008

Smell: Smells deeply of dark fruits, a little coffee in there as well. A little reminiscent of Aventinus. 
Taste: Here's where the Aventinus comparison ends. Traditional stout flavors present first, with deep roasted malts and balancing hops. The coffee pulls midway trough the tasting. Some cocoa also noted. The coffee bitterness is well-controlled and is a little less dominant (eg- KBS). Alcohol presence is there, but is not 'boozy'.
Mouthfeel: Creamy and thick, clean at the finish.
Drinakbility: I'm not a big coffee guy, but this brew can convert me. Not at all overpowering- adds to the drinakbility. A sipper nonetheless due to its complexity and ABV. 734 characterscoalcracker, Nov 17, 2008

Is this the best imperial stout I've ever tasted? No. But it's definitely the best one in Canada.

This is minor quibbling though, it really is a fine beer. 763 charactersmarkaberrant, Nov 16, 2008

1" head dies back very fast.. no lacing.. but a descent film/cap.
Initial aroma is coffee and little else.. cold brewed java.. some significant vanilla as it warms.. with a milk chocolate... 
Flavor is no where near as sweet as the nose lets on.. big coffee .. some chocolate.. reminds alot me of chocolate coated coffee beans.. more of a carbonated rich French Roast than beer with a shot or two of Starbucks liquor.. wow.. I am even sure what to say as it hits room temperature.. more coffee than beer... I am struggling to pick out beer flavors.. I like great coffee (and obviously beer)... and this is far and away the best of both worlds. there is just enough sweetness to make sure the flavors mesh well... the brown sugar flavors emerge alot more as it hits room temperature.. finish is loooong cold brewed coffee. it's the beans without too much astringency.. I've had many .. many... many crappy cups of coffee with less flavor... really this is pretty badass.
Body is like a fairly thick milk stout.. but for this ABV.... I am very impressed.. lite for the style and a sorta prickly carbonation.. 
I must again thank Alex.. this is my first time for the Péché Mortel and I am very very impressed.. I would not ever think for a second that this would age well.. there is just too much going on... very nice.

4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Had the luxury of this one on tap over the summer at Eulogy in Philly, and it was very impressive. Profuse thanks to tpd975 for giving me the chance to savor it again. 
So far so good, as it looks quite nice in the snifter. Poured out like oil. Utterly dark as hell, yet somehow not what I would call black...almost like the darkest shade of brown naturally possible. The head is thin, but what's there is light brown and it dissolves to a crown quickly. Brown splotches of lace look like candle-wax drippings.
Nothing but roast in the nose. You better dig coffee if you come near this. It's almost hard to glean anything else from it other than the mighty roasted bean. A light layer of frothed cream ekes through, but ultimately it's all about the coffee.
Flavor is enormous. That's not to say it's complex, but it's highly unique. In fact, when I would think of it over the past few months, after my first and only meeting, I could always recall the flavor. And here it is. It's bitter, like coffee--not like hops; it has a bite, like a killer dark roast; it thrusts itself forward and screams "coffee!!!" And like a good cup, it's got balance. I hope I'm not imagining this, but Dieu Du Ciel even remembered the sugar and cream--nice lactic tones and a hint of sweetness. Black licorice appears with warming. And wouldn't you know, there's some coffee in the finish... 
The mouth is just a little too tingly and a little too thin for what's going on here. In some way the carbonation matches the intensity of flavor, but thicker and creamier would've really done the trick. Then again, if they were really trying to go for a true coffee stout, the watery element kind of works. I could grow to like the texture in this case, but ultimately I think big stouts should also be as smooth and creamy as possible (see: Bell's Expedition Stout, standard bearer of all stout greatness).
I find this comparable to Founder's Breakfast Stout in terms of a stout you actually could enjoy for breakfast. Otherwise it reminds a Southern Tier's Jah-va in terms of flavor. In the end, Peche Mortel is its own intriguing beer. As for the 9.5% alcohol, I have no idea where it's at, which increases drinkability to a dangerous degree. But this stuff is pretty pricey, so it probably won't be replacing the morning cup of joe anytime soon. If I could find this in our area, I'd buy on sight again with no hesitation. 2,406 charactersMetalmonk, Nov 04, 2008

The head rose well above the beer and was dark tan in color almost brown. Creamy with some decent retention, once it started to recede then lacing was left all over the inside of the glass.
Aroma is of espresso, slight alcohol.
Smokey, roasted, creamy, espresso. Really an amazing beer. I've certainly fallen in love with Imperial Stouts. This is a great one.

A: Pours pitch black. Blacker than I have ever seen in a beer. A large tan head forms with great retention (very impressive considering this has such a high alcohol content) and stays as a ring when it finally does recede. Some spiderweb lace is left along the glass. 
S: A huge aroma of coffee/espresso. Roasted malt is dominate. Some chocolate, vanilla, and rum like alcohol.
T: Follows the nose. Lots of roasted malt, coffee and espresso flavors. Some bitter chocolate flavors. Just a huge malt profile that is to die for.
M/D: A full and rich body that is a bit chalky. Creamy and exceptional. This is so smooth and easy to drink. I usually find that coffee beers are a bit harder to drink. This is just incredibly rich and inviting. I can't get enough.
Without a doubt the best coffee stout I have ever had. Well worth the hype. In the words of Homer Simpson "You would step over your on Mother just to get one." 999 characterschamp103, Nov 02, 2008
4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours an utterly opaque black with a bubbly, light-cappuccino coloured head that is quite foamy and large, settling to a thin ring and leaving plenty of lacing around the glass.
Smells of espresso, dark, bitter chocolate, with just a hint of sweet but roasted caramel.
Dark espresso and chocolate flavours throughout. Some muted dark fruit and caramel sweetness. Alcohol is felt on the finish. A lot of coffee, but balanced nicely by the chocolate and dark fruit/grains.
Body coats the mouth nicely, creamy, soft and full feeling, yet light with nice carbonated bubbly feel.
Drinkability is only slightly dampened by the alcohol felt on the finish. This beer goes down well for its size.
A delicious brew, well deserving of its high rating, and one I will enjoy as often as I can. Edited to change appearance rating, as subsequent pours had significantly better head production/retention. 893 charactersnighthawk, Nov 01, 2008

TEMP: Cellared @ approx 45 degrees
Thanks to upsjeff for this bottle!
No light can penetrate the blackness that this liquid has. Truly black. Very nice dark tan colored thick two-fingered head of dense foam. Good retention. Excellent 'curtain-like' lacing. Not so much 'lace', as it is more like a solid sheet of film. Excellent!
Very nice hefty malt nose. A small swirl brings out notes of dark fruit. Light coffee scent is present, though not as much as expected.
Big dark malts mixed with espresso shots hit you first. Chocolate notes mingle with dark fruit sweetness. An ever so light hint of vanilla kind of levels things out to a very nice balance.
Very nice and silky in the mouth. Creamy smooth, yet light.
Excellently drinkable. I can't argue with so many before who have rated this brew so highly. It truly is worthy of it's praise. 874 characterscoldmeat23, Oct 30, 2008
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours an elegant black with off brown head. Enticing scent of roasted coffee, black licorice, a bit medicinal but sweet overpowers. A wonderful taste awaits full of dark roasted coffee flavors, earthy notes, and chewy dark chocolate covered hops to finish the drink. The alcohol is hidden extremely well behind the full bodied taste and density. One of the best stouts I've had, definitely worth experiencing. 409 charactersJRed, Oct 30, 2008

Carbonation bubbles are very compact. Smell is strong of roasted coffee beans, malt, chocolate, with a touch of tartness. First taste bolts out huge expresso flavors with a slight coffee ground bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel has an oil like film on a dense, viscous dark liquid. There is a medium and somewhat sharp carbonation. Sticky bitter coffee chocolate like resin lingers on the gums. This is extemely sticky and dense. Overall this is an exceptional brew at the top of its class. Tons of coffee expresso flavor with a fantastic finish. 630 charactersAMo, Oct 29, 2008
4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed with my girlfriend and given to me so generously by my good buddy Victor.
A: Poured black and viscous with a thick amount of head; stuck to the glass for a long period of time.
S: A generous amount of coffee and cocoa aroma. Very rich!!! 
T: The coffee flavoring is more definitive with the taste, varying between a strong espresso and cappuccino. There is also a sweet characteristic, which in this case may be some sort of dark chocolate. The alcohol also seems to numb the tongue a bit, and the after taste leaves that cocoa powder feeling on the palate. 
M: Almost perfect! 
D: Alcohol is somewhat hidden....tasty and could probably enjoy all night. 
Overall: An amazing beer. A perfect example of a coffee stout...a must try. 743 charactersOlieIPA, Oct 27, 2008

A- For a beer that has a dark, dark brown complexion, the head on this baby could not be more beautiful. With every sip the head that gathered on sides of the glass were so defined with hundreds of tiny sparkling ringlets (almost reminded me of my favorite fireworks on the 4th of July)...absolutely mesmerizing. 
S- Coffee! With a nice hint of sweet, burnt malt coming after.
T- Follows the nose. The taste buds initially detect a lot of coffee flavor, but this is backed up by a sweet malt flavor...possibly some dark chocolates as well.
M- Smooth and viscous. Perfect texture, nice and creamy.
D- If only this were a sessionable beer, it would be absolutely perfect. High alcohol content and texture of the beer keep it from being so, but still very nice.
Top quality. May have to make a trip across the border when I head up to Vermont for my ski trip. Reminded me a lot of the FBS, but a little better. 957 charactersrhinos00, Oct 25, 2008
4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Yamar18 for this BA Top 100. Really, incredible brew!
Appearance: Pours pitch black with foamy brown head. Initial 1.5 finger height slowly diminishes down to a thin cap. Totally opaque.
Edit: The first glass we poured it into was wet and did this beauty wrong. It's easily a two finger head that drags sticky lacing down the side of the glass. One wiseman said that if it was poured into a coffee mug in the early hours it would be indistinguishable from coffee. 
Smell: Espresso, straight up. Maybe some dark chocolate in there too, but make no mistake, this smells like strong gourmet coffee. 
Taste: Wow! Starts off a bit spicy (peppery, citrusy even?) before transforming into espresso and milky creamer, with a touch of chocolate and mild burnt malts. Incredible masking. Just... awesome!
Mouthfeel: This was an instant 5 for all of us. So f*ckin creamy with good carbonation and incredible mouth-coating. Extremely rich.
Drinkability: More of a dessert beer, but then again it's so ridiculously rich and smooth. Definitely not something you could drink all night (due to body and sweetness), but very suitable for after dinner or anytime you need a hug.
Note: All three wisemen rated this beer. It was so delicious and had such a unique and amazing mouthfeel that we opened the only other bottle - we had to get at some more. 1,352 charactersThreeWiseMen, Oct 25, 2008
4.77/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Dark, very dark. Really opaque too, no light goes through. Pours a nice mocha colored head.
Smell: Eventually, coffee is very present in the smell of this beer. Even if coffee is dominant, we still can catch some vanilla and cocoa aroma. 
Taste: That's where this beer really shines. It has an intense coffee taste. The vanilla and cocoa seems a little muted if compared to the smell but they are still present. Nice bitterness from the hops that adds to the complexity of the beer.
Mouthfeel: Full, but not overly full. Really round and smooth, almost cream-like.
Drinkability: Very drinkable, but the high alcohol level and the intense coffee flavor helps us to escape this mortal sin. 703 charactersflipper2gv, Oct 24, 2008
4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Wow! This is easily one of the finest looking beers these eyes have ever seen. It pours a pitch black, onyx color. There's absolutely no light getting through. The head is immaculate. It's a dark, mocha brown color and stands roughly two and a half fingers deep. Retention is excellent. It will probably outlast the beer. Very thick sheets of lace clung to the glass. Spectacular. This one couldn't look any better.
Smell: There's a very dominant coffee aroma here. It's in your face from the first whiff and does not go away. As a coffee fanatic, that's just fine by me. There's a sweet, dark chocolate malt aroma on the secondary level that complements the coffee aroma very well. If you stick with it, a fine aroma of roasted malts emerges. While it doesn't strike me as incredibly complex or deep, this is one hell of a fine smelling beer.
Taste: The coffee flavor is every bit as strong here as it was on the nose. It smells absolutely delicious. Perhaps I should qualify that by saying it smells delicious to a huge coffee fan. If you're not into coffee, you probably won't appreciate all that it is. A nice mix of roasted and chocolate malts add some sweetness and character. They complement the strong coffee flavor very well. Surprisingly, no alcohol is noted. While coffee is the predominant flavor, the other components really drive it to being an excellent beer. The nose advertised it pretty well. It's not really deep or complex, but it does have a lot of character and a damn fine flavor.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's full bodied and has a very nice, creamy feel. Carbonation is active yet it retains a very smooth feel. Drinkability is good, but it's limited a little by the high abv and perhaps the strong coffee flavor. It's just a little too big in terms of strength and feel to warrant more than one or two. At least that's the case for me.
Peche Mortel...Mortal Sin...FTW. This is a flat out excellent beer. Perhaps my view of it is a little skewed by my love for coffee. I believe it'd be difficult for someone who's not into coffee to get into this beer. Coffee is just so central to the flavor that you almost have to like it to like this beer. But, I'd recommend this to anyone. It's truly an epic beer. 2,244 charactersprototypic, Oct 22, 2008

Retention is decent, and it eventually dissipates to leave a foam film with nice lacing. Smells of roasted coffee which dominates the slight chocolate malt and a syrup/molasses presence. Dark, sweet fruit esters in the background. The taste is more coffee, but this time the roasted notes are more evident. Chocolate earthiness comes through, making it slightly bitter. The feel is thick and verging on oily. Overall, a really impressive beer that I quite enjoyed in spite of the fact that I'm not a coffee drinker. 555 charactersphilipquarles, Oct 21, 2008
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Picked up a 11.5oz bottle of this beer at Valley Wine in Steubville OH @ $5.99 a bottle for my 500th review. Served in a large Delirium snifter poured opaque black with a generous creamy fluffy mocha colored head with good retention leaving a constiant creamy layer and sticky ebby lacing down the glass.
Strong roasty,dark fruittyness lots of chocolate with strong black coffee throughout with a slight touch of heat.
The aroma was more complex than anticipated.
A nice velvety creaminess leads to a strong sharp roastyness with some dark sweet fruitiness in the mix. Strong burnt tastes almost metallic like very woody with a dry nuttiness with a dusty chocolate coating and intense expresso and fresly roasted coffee throughout finishes with a mouthfill of dark freshly ground coffee beans. Quite drinkable just too flavorful to be followed by another.One to sip, suprizing how well hidden the alcohol was. 500 is now in the books! 936 charactersjcdiflorio, Oct 21, 2008

Not a hint of light coming through the edges of the glass, but a billowing head of surprisingly light ochre puffs right up, leaving substantial webs of lace as it slowly subsides. Bright fruitiness, grape and cherry, is immediately apparent in the nose. The coffee is irrepressible though, and there are darker notes of treacle and currant as well. Taste is assertive and deep. The coffee is more obvious, and there's a mild note of dark chocolate that I hadn't yet picked up. The fruitiness is subdued, but still present, the cherry notes getting a bit lost. Mouthfeel is only a shade flat, the body making up for it. Drinkability is very, very good for such a big stout. Revelatory and truly imperial, this is a beer that is worth its reputation. 795 charactersMandrake, Oct 21, 2008
3.02/5  rDev -31.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Don't forget the umlauts. Pours a rich black midnight color with a soft tan head and lacing. Moderate viscosity. Good head retention and lacing through out the tasting.
The nose is mostly coffee notes with some mild malt undertones. To start there is a thick coffee aroma with noticeable roast and earthy undertones. Not like a latte or espresso, but coffee straight up. Would have liked more of a malt characteristic has it is really lacking the depth. Noticeable yeast notes but figs and other tropical fruits. Some lighter esters, rose mostly, and a touch of alcohol.
The taste is bit more in tune but still over emphasizes the burnt coffee characteristics. A more rich coffee note again, but some roast and chocolate notes are a tad more detectable. The yeast/esters come out even more than the nose. Has a Belgian characteristic with some dry plums, fig notes and big rose notes. The alcohol is really noticeable and if more of a deterrent than anything.
The body is moderately full to full. Some creaminess texture and noticeable astringency in the malt. Overall even for a coffee beer this is really out of balance and way to yeast for a stout. IMHO this beer is over rated. 1,184 charactersOxymoron, Oct 20, 2008

Pretty thick pour, very viscous. Immediately roast coffee hits my nose. This is unlike any other beer I have had. There is no joking around with the coffee aspect if this beer. It smells like the spent grains from an espresso shot...wonderful. The taste follows the smell but also brings in more complexity. You get a lot of burnt and roasted coffee, along with ample amounts of dark chocolate and burnt sugar. The bitterness and balance of this beer are incredible. This is addictingly good. 584 charactersDouglas14, Oct 20, 2008
4.24/5  rDev -3.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Excited to finally try this out. Thanks to Yamar18 for this as an extra. Poured into my Stone RIS goblet. Served at 50°F and let stand for 15 minutes because it still seemed too cold.
Looks like a stout. Not too much notable; tan foam that recedes from less than one finger to a faint ring. Almost pitch black with chocolate corners. Minimal lacing.
Aroma is fabulous. Very strong coffee presence, like the smell that fills your mouth biting into dark chocolate covered espresso beans. Faint alcohol and roasted barley come to mind. Guessing by the smell, this beer needs to be served at room temp to fully express itself.
The flavor profile is a slightly muted version of the aroma. Lots of coffee and dark chocolate, and lots of bitter roasted barley, but they steered way clear of being tart despite the acidity of the ingredients. The coffee flavor is much more subtle than the aroma. Very mildly sweet with a subtle lingering bitterness.
Great mouthfeel. Light carbonation (always a hit for me). Low carbonation risks exposing the acidity, but once again all danger has been skillfully averted. Sublimely rich and sticky, and simultaneously light enough to quaff. A big beer for sure, but not too big.
Another great example of "just right." Not a monster to be tamed, but a classy, civilized work of art. Westy 8° and Kate the Great also come to mind, as these are all beers that achieve similar depth but remain perfectly balanced and drinkable. 
A welcome beer in my cellar. Cheers to this achievement! 1,517 charactersrayjay, Oct 20, 2008

Aroma is big coffee mixed with nice sweet malt and mingled in chocolate notes. Some underlying bitterness like old coffee noted. Nose is very nice and very aromatic.
Taste is big loads of malt loaded with coffee, lots of coffee. Nice sweet chocolate notes that try to mellow the coffee out, but fall short. This is a big stout loads of flavor, malt, coffee and chocolate notes mingled through out. Some bitterness in finish but can't really tell if its coffee or coffee bitterness the way its perfectly blended together.
Mouthfeel is nice big smooth almost chewy just falling a little short. Carbonation is just enough to let you know its there.
Drinkability is great a very good a huge stout full of flavor so damn good. Only down side is its a little pricey but next time I see any I will be buying several to hold on to for those special occasions that demand a great stout. Highly recommended. 1,055 charactersmntlover, Oct 16, 2008

Cola brown pour, with a big 3 fingers of semi fizzy froth. First whiff brought strong aromas of coffee. As she warmed a little, the phenol became apparent. Roasty chocolate malt and somehow it seems this has a nice hoppiness to it. Hint of vanilla, some nice marshmellow gooey sweetness. A touch oily but what a beautiful blend of coffee and hop oil.

4.32/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours slowly from a 11.5oz brown bottle (twist-off cap) into the center of my globe glass. It's black and opaque, even around the edges, with a nice inch of tan head. The head settles and leaves a little lacing behind.
Aroma is intensely roasty with bitter dark chocolate and coffee, somewhat sweet.
Flavor is nicely bittered from all the roasted malt and coffee. It starts more sweet and roasty before going quickly, almost sharply, bitter. It's a fun experience but I don't think I would enjoy more than one. I also think it would be better at cellar temperature instead of straight from the fridge. I'll be sure to drink it slowly to see how it develops as it warms.
Mouthfeel is a thick, bitter, and a little over carbonated for my tastes. Drinkability is good but that's all relative. I wouldn't want a growler all to myself.
Overall, very solid. It makes me think that there really should be a category for coffee stouts. There certainly are many good ones available. 977 charactersGilGarp, Oct 10, 2008

Appearance: This brew is a deeply opaque black colour with a huge tan head that lasts until the bottom of the glass.
Smell: The aroma of this brew screams Espresso. caramel, and roasted malt notes hidden beneath the mound of espresso beans.
Taste: This brew tastes like a dream. First the fresh espresso notes hit hard, followed by a nice dark chocolate flavor. Than the roasted malts and the subdued but caramel-like sweetness come into play in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Smooth as silk and as creamy as a milkshake. 
Drinkability: How can a 9%abv espresso assault be this easy to drink. This is easily the easiest drinking coffee beer that I have ever consumed. In fact this is one of the easiest drinking strong stouts that I have ever had as well.

Black with a monstrous mocha head. Daunting. Sinks into a marshmellow depression.
Alcohol smell is a little strong. I get a small hint of other scents but to me the nose is predominantly alcohol and not very pleasing at all.
Taste is of strong coffee beans. Real strong actually. Thankfully the alcohol presence in the nose is not in the taste. As a matter of fact, this stuff tastes great.
Even though I start out with it a little cold, the carbonation is already laid back and lax. Mid to full body.
I never really did appreciate the smell, but the taste and the feel were awesome.

A - Poured out an opaque, dark, dark brown color with scarlet hints. It had a thick, long lasting, caramel-colored head that left sticky, wide rings of lace on the glass.
S - Aroma was amazing. I could smell the coffee notes without even putting my nose near the glass. Also, notes of molasses and maple syrup sweetness.
T - Coffee is the dominant flavor mixed with chocolate, toffee and roasted malt.
M - It was soft, smooth and creamy. A medium-bodied beer that is a slow sipper.
D - This beer was worthy of the hype. I am not a coffee drinker, but this was outstanding. If coffee tasted this good I might take up the habit. 672 characterszeff80, Oct 05, 2008

The taste is much better than the aroma initially suggested. Even more coffee comes out now with a deep roastiness and it sticks around. Finishes bitter, mostly from roast and coffee but there are some hops in there as well.
Mouthfeel is medium and very smooth with the perfect level of carbonation.
Very good flavor with this one but the aroma seemed underwhelming. I always see people saying that this one used to be better. I wish I could have tried it back then because this stuff is pretty damn good now. 863 charactersroadhouse, Oct 04, 2008
4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Got this beer from northyorksammy, thanks! It pours a pitch black color with a creamy off-white, beige head.
Smell of coffee, just on the edge of spent coffee, or how is that called in English. It's smell is full of dark malts and blends well together with the coffee. I also get a chocolate flavor. 
Taste is roasted malt with coffee. Basically this is the concept of the beer. This beer deserves a 5 for execution. The roasted malts add a nice maltbiterness and some chocolate notes. There is little carbonation, which is good too. Mouthfeel is superb, smooth and creamy. I wonder how they do that. The coffee never gets sharp or astringent and unlike my own coffee beers, it's aftertaste is smooth. Bitterness is medium and hops are a bit American, not sure if it is, but they appear a bit citric. 802 charactersAbsumaster, Oct 03, 2008
4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Tried for the first time on bartender's recommendation at Moan & Dove a couple months ago and thought it was a pretty good coffee stout.
Have now had 3 bottles of it, and am a huge fan. Definitely one of the top 5 beers of any style I've had.
Appearance is basically black, and in the light maybe could be called the darkest brown, a half shade this side of black. Dark tan (looks like a cappuccino) head that lasts and lasts. Nothing unusual here, but for what it's worth, lacing was covering the glass at the final sip each time. 
Strong overtones of coffee, slight (pretty faint) chocolate, very malty and definite presence of hops. Coffee dominates for sure. 
Taste is amazing. The blend of coffee, chocolate, malt and alcohol meld together amazingly. Nothing hits you so much that it kills the others, the whole thing just works. Very balanced.
Mouthfeel is very good, but not something I think particularly stands out when you drink this one. 
Drinkability... I'd generally say a high abv brew isn't something you'd want to hammer down all night, but this one I could literally drink 4 or 5 of over several hours. You don't want to rush it, it's something to enjoy and savor -- but as soon as you finish one, you will want another.
This is the only Dieu du Ciel brew I've had, but very impressed. 1,309 characterschuckd123, Oct 03, 2008
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Dispensed from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. Emerges pitch black with a cocoa powder colored head of about two fingers in size. Great retention and tons of lacing. The head lasts for nearly theentire session. 
Aroma is coffee with dark fruits, chocolate, and a bit of alcohol. Fresh ground coffee definitely stands out the most and is a wonderful aroma. Some vanilla and figs are present as well.
Big coffee flavors. Actually, huge coffee. Tastes as if I am sucking on a sweet coffee bean. A touch of vanilla but mostly coffee in this one. 
Mouthfeel was a little thin, in my opinion. Bubbly and slighty thin but a very nice overall. Glad I was finally able to purchase a fresh bottle of this. A bit expensive for drinking often a very nice celebratory or "special evening" type beer 786 charactersSaCkErZ9, Oct 01, 2008
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Purchased a 11.5oz brown twist-off bottle for $4.99
I remember when this beer began to buzz around the beer circuit a few years back. I saw it on the shelves a few years back and I was surprised to see it priced at $19.99 for a small bottle. Well, here it is, years later, and greater distribution provided me with a more reasonably priced bottle. I poured this into my Delirium snifter and the midnight black body formed a mocha colored head of medium sized carbonation. The body is totally opaque and the head provides wonderful lacing. Heavy carbonation lines the rim of the glass. The aroma is wonderfully expressive with massive espresso and cocoa bean notes. The sweetness is fresh ground coffee fills the nostrils and provides a wonderful entry point to the taste. There a remnants of malted milk balls that add anticipation. I am not sure if it is the odd or perfect. Just one of those aromas that seem familiar, yet so unique. The taste is filled with coffee and roasted malts. A big dose of bittering hops adds a wonderful balance of bitterness to the heavy malt body. The high abv is hardly noticeable although it adds a slight warmth to the mouthfeel. The body is rich yet thinned out and dried by the high carbonation. As this beer warms up, the delicate flavors open up a bit more and the sweetness comes out. This is a wonderful beer that is worth the hype. Not your everyday beer, but definitely one that should take up some space in your cellar. 1,463 charactersALESwhatCURESya, Oct 01, 2008

Scent of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, sugars and some dark sweet fruit. Great strength with great balance and depth, I could get used to this.
Taste of coffee starts and finishes this beer, there is no escape from that, but it is balanced very well with chocolate, roasted malts and dark fruit balancing out the bitterness of the coffee.
Mouthfeel is creamy smooth going down equally smooth, lovely.
Drinkability is great, but this should be enjoyed at a reasonable pace. 558 characterspaco1029384756, Sep 29, 2008

S - Very strong, yet one dimensional, aroma of coffee. Roasted coffee beans with the slightest hint of a spicy hoppiness linering underneath.
T - A creamy sweetness initailly, quickly overcome by an overwhelming fresh roasted coffee taste. A spicy hop bitterness provides just a smidgen of balance but the coffee is the star here. If you enjoy coffee-centric beers this is the one for you.
M/D - Very full-bodied and smooth, almost creamy. Easy drinking despite the high ABV. The only thing holding this back is the dominating coffee taste with little to balance it out. 755 charactersckeegan04, Sep 28, 2008
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is big boozy beer, and I knew that looking at the label, but I'm a little sorry I let that stop me from drinking it until now. It is quite balanced and refreshing, like port with the freshness of the stems included (rare), or Mas des Chimeres 2005 as it warms on the patio of Slows.
Really, refreshing. Not sour at all, but full of lift. Some of this must be attributed to hops, but I sense nothing hop-monolithic. Bitterness is burnt sweet seed, fine grained, fresh and herbal, no terpene assault. Hooray! It sucks to relate such an obviously fine beer with descriptions of what it is not. This is truly excellent. I could easily drink a case. It tastes like 80% chocolate, but fine enough to eat, which is possible but rare.
Begs to be related to Expedition Stout. This is better i think. And I'm sad to say it. (Keep in mind, I have an irrational aversion to mass, weight and alcohol unnecessarily present ...) 920 charactersputnam, Sep 26, 2008

Not a very strong nose. Sweet chocolate and coffee, roasted malt character.
Very sweet up front with slightly bitter chocolate notes. Next comes the coffee, lots of coffee notes. Coffee dominates the finish.

Coffee beans, dark chocolate, tons of cocoa nibs, and some roasty/smoky malt. Flavor is more dry coffee, espresso, and cocoa. Higher carbonation and lower viscosity than other big stouts results in a beer that's more drinkable and more like some sort of coffee/beer hybrid than just a beer with coffee added. More intense coffee flavor and aroma than any other coffee beer I've tried. 486 characterstrill, Sep 20, 2008

S: Coffee, dark fruit & chcolate in abundance
T: Much coffee, a touch of baker's & iron up front. More coffee & coffee grounds as this warms, along with charred grains, & richer chocolate as this warms. Finishes with mocha, dark chcolate & subtle coffee

Smell was light with hints of coffee and roasted beans. the taste is what caught me, it was quite light and sweet with a very subtle yet noticable coffee flavor. It was pretty much dead on perfect.

4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle from Capone's in Norristown, PA. At $7, this is the cheapest I have ever seen or heard of this beer being sold. So that's a good start. Pours extremely dark brown, almost black, with a short tawny head. Very little light makes its way through this beer. Smells strongly of raw dark chocolate, carob beans, espresso, rum. Taste is a big roasted cocoa bean punch, burnt and black and bitter, mixed in with a strong deep-roasted coffee bean smack, aggressive and grainy. Definite alcohol presence on the finish, along with a restrained dark fruit flavor. Nice mix of flavors, very well done. Maybe a step away from being full bodied. Overall very interesting and not just a one-note coffee stout. 700 charactersaforbes10, Sep 17, 2008

it tastes almost like an ice coffee. the most coffee I've ever had in a stout. I should've had this for breakfast. 
Mouthfeel is a bit creamy but could be better. A bit light.
Drinkability is fair. It is a bit of a strong coffee taste for me -- and that's saying a lot. I'm a one pot with fresh ground beans in the am kind of guy. 554 charactersJonathanL7890, Sep 16, 2008

3.83/5  rDev -13%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3Thanks to EmperorStan for this one; a new addition to the lineup available in KS. Poured into a snifter and paired with some 70% cacao Lindt.
A: Ridiculously beautiful. Pours an opaque near-black, with a medium dark tan head which leaves exemplary lacing and a perfect little crown. Streams of carbonation continue to be visible, and they constantly rise up to maintain the remainder of the head. Really, this is pretty much a spot-on example of the archetypal stout of my dreams.
S: COFFEE. Pretty bitter coffee, actually. I'm also picking up some juicy peach as well as some very dark chocolate (although maybe that's just my pairing). There's also a bit of a scent which reminds me of rotting bio-waste... I suppose it qualifies its strange name!
T: Again, COFFEE. It's overpowering, really; I can still distinguish the other tastes that were also present in the nose, but the bitterness of the coffee is so omnipresent that it makes the beer kind of unbalanced. The bitterness recedes to make way for a more candy-sugary sweetness as the beer warms, but the coffee taste is still just overwhelming.
M: Pleasantly creamy, yet with a bitter aftertaste. Great body; very substantial and hearty.
D: I want to like this beer, I really do, but the bitterness is just too much. I'm a big fan of stouts, but I'm also a big fan of balance. It's kind of a struggle for me to get through this, but its redeeming qualities make the drinking experience enjoyable if not entirely easy. 1,480 charactersjenitivecase, Sep 15, 2008
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Quite black, about as inky a beer as I've seen this side of Speedway stout. I didn't elicit a lot of head with the pour, but I was using a chalice. A sticky collar retains, and there's a lot of lacing. 
Roasted malt, black coffee, and a little bit of sweetness on the nose. Tons of power. 
Bitter chocolate and coffee flavors. I love coffee, and I drink it quite frequently. This tastes to me like the iced coffees with soy milk that I make with my leftover morning joe. That's a good thing: I drink them because I love the taste. This tastes like a cool, mildly sweetened and thickened cup of strong coffee. 
The coffee is most noticeable, but there are plenty of other things going on, from the chocolate to the black patent malt flavors. Very impressive and chewy, and since the hops are much in the back, the mouthfeel is very well done: chewy, thick and creamy. 
Awesome beer for a coffee lover. 904 charactersBretSikkink, Sep 15, 2008
4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the 11oz bottle into a Maudite snifter. Body is a deep dark black, crowned by a huge dark tan head that doesn't lace but rather leaves a solid layer of foam on the glass. Aroma is heavy on roasted malt and mocha, with a good dose of vanilla bean in the background.
 Palate is heavy on roasted malt up front, with some nice hoppy bitterness to balance things out. After the initial burst of coffee flavor a rich sweetness emerges, with vanilla and a touch of maple. The roastiness wins out in longevity, though, lingering long after the swallow.
 Body is big, rich, and smooth, with a good creamy mouthfeel. While a slow sipper, this is a very drinkable high-gravity stout. Super tasty and rich, one of the best stouts I've ever had. 744 charactersElGordo, Sep 14, 2008
4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Oddly, this beer seems like a combo of a couple other beers. Deep and dark, basically pitch black until held to the light, which still doesn't let much through. A rich, creamy tan head rises atop the darkness and remains nearly through the entire beer. Steady, slowly rising carbonation. Smell reminds me of Breakfast Stout mainly but mixed with the Baltic Porter from DR. Not sure what it is but that's what it reminds me of. Bitter dark chocolate and definitely a huge dose of coffee. Piney hops underneath, becoming more noticeable as the beer warms. It's funny, the flavor pulls a switch up on me every once in a while. Usually, a healthy coffee flavor is the first thing that comes up but sometimes bitterness before it. It's definitely there in the finish every time. There is a little more sweetness in the flavor than the smell, reminiscent of an espresso, though at times the roast comes full force. It's never smokey or burnt tasting, though, which I'm thankful for. Pretty good mouthfeel, nice and round, nearly full. The bitterness takes away from the fuller stout mouthfeel that I'm used to, keeping it from being creamy and rich as many others. As a hop head, this touch of bitterness isn't a terrible thing, just a little out of the norm. The carbonation was on point. Yes please, may I have another? Maybe just one more but that's about it. 
I remember when this wasn't available in the US yet...or maybe you lucky bastards had it in PA at times? Either way, I had two trades; one with papat444 and the other with mattt, both very generous Canadians, thanks guys! ;-) 
It's almost cheaper to trade for a sixer or two of this stuff from Canadia than to buy singles in the US...hell , I think it is for sure! Regardless, I'll probably find myself splurging on a single every now and then...damn, maybe not. Founders is coming! 1,842 charactersncvbc, Sep 13, 2008
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3Luckily I picked up six of these hard to find brews at a local shop. I've had them before, but this is my first review after a few go-a-rounds with it.
It pours dark, rich head (only for a bit). Quickly after the pour the nose is of coffee and dark chocolate, but as soon as the head dissipates, not much scent unless you get your nose really close, then of coffee and tobacco.
One very important note, you MUST drink this beer near cellar temps. If you don't, you are missing out on everything this beer is meant to be. I think I've only read one other review that mentions that...and it's 100% true. Maybe it's common knowledge, but just thought I'd bring it up again.
The first taste...as you would expect, COFFEE! It is a very refined coffee taste, with a malty sweetness, along with just a little dark chocolate flavor. This flavor lingers a LONG TIME on the palate. The mouth feel is creamy and with just a touch of carbonation (here's why I recommend the higher temp enjoyment, drinking this right out of the fridge destroys the mouth feel, WAY too bright on the tongue IMHO), but with just enough hop to cut the cream to an enjoyable level. A slight bitterness on the tongue at the finish.
I do feel a little kick of alcohol, but in this brew it adds to the enjoyment for me.
I rate this beer highly in all categories except drinkability, where it's just average. I struggle with this rating, is high drinkability necessarily good? This isn't a beer you're going to chug down a six pack in a couple hours...it's a beer to savor throughout, the complex interaction of coffee, malt, dark chocolate, and tobacco flavors is far more satisfying that pure drinkability.
If this isn't on your top 5 of all time favorite stouts (or even #1), you seriously need to reconsider you selections! Top notch in every way! 1,819 charactersmjrtoo, Sep 13, 2008

4.87/5  rDev +10.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Got this one from my buddy BeerTruth. Thanks man.
Pours a thick black, no light getting through this baby, with a dense and creamy tan head that fills two plus inches of the tulip and spills slightly over the sides. Settles very slowly leaving a great lace and lots of stick.
Smell has just an awesome coffee aroma, deep and powerful, along with bittersweet dark chocolate and even a hint of dark fruits.
Taste is rich and creamy and incredibly tasty. Coffee and bittersweet chocolate are the dominant flavors, but some roasted malt lends a bit of bitterness through the finish. There's a touch of dark fruits in there, too. Coffee is intense but the chocolate provides a great counterpart with just a bit of sweetness. It's a deep, espresso sort of coffee flavor, but it is not harsh and bitter like Beer Geek Breakfast. Awesome balance, great depth of flavor. 
Mouthfeel is viciously creamy, full bodied, thick and chewy, a delight on the palate.
Damn, this is an incredible beer. Between this and Founders Breakfast Stout it's pretty much a tossup, but the Founders is easier to get and more widely available, so I'm not quite sure this can knock it from its perch of best coffee stout in my book. But it's damn close. Incredible beer I will certainly seek out again. 1,275 charactersnumber1bum, Sep 09, 2008

A- Body is a thick, deep, opaque dark brown-nearly black. Pours with a 2 finger tan (coffee colored) creamy head. One can constantly see tiny bubbles being added to it. Head retains wonderfully but eventually fades to a very thick collar and plenty of lacing is left behind in the glass.
S-Nose is very rich in chocolate malt. A hint of roasted toffee and caramel sweetness can also be gathered. Smells like a good cup of blended coffee in the morning.
T-Upfront is a toffee and caramel like sweetness and a deep, rich chocolate malt backbone. Roasted malt bitterness and a touch of alcohol are added for the finish. Some alcohol warmth lingers but overall the alcohol is very well hidden. 
M-Low carbonation and thick body that is smooth as silk. Its not too thick though. Perfect for the style.
D-This is a great beer and I am happy I was able to find it and have the opportunity to try it. This beer definitely gets better as it warms so give it a chance to after you pour it. I really like this stout and will have it again. 1,100 charactersPittBeerGirl, Sep 09, 2008

Nose is straight up, very intense, coffee grounds. Not brewed coffee, but like you just opened a can of coffee and are taking a huge whiff. It's a very dark espresso coffee smell. Dark dark dark chocolate. It actually has this earthiness about it, almost a green coffee sort of smell. Interesting.
Oh my god. This beer is like drinking espresso. Extreme espresso bitterness and tons and tons and tons of dark bitter chocolate and espresso beans. It literally tastes exactly like eating those chocolate covered espresso beans you get at fancy candy shops. Extremely bitter, but pure espresso bean bitterness. Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter. Espresso, espresso, espresso, espresso. Ends with a long lingering espresso bean bitterness.
There are beers out there that taste like coffee, and others that taste like chocolate. This beer tastes like your eating espresso beans. Not drinking espresso mind you, I mean actually eating raw(well toasted dark, not green), but eating raw espresso beans. Very interesting. Could go amazingly well wtih vanilla ice-cream. Although.... chocolate or a coffee desert might pair really well, I'd just be afraid it's complete and total overload. A great beer, but it's such a one trick pony, I'd really find it hard to drink more than one in a sitting. 1,348 characterstaez555, Sep 07, 2008

Pours an absolutely beautiful pitch black color with a deep tan foamy head. Aroma has lots of roasted coffee aroma, with a faint alcohol note. Wow, smells more like coffee than beer. Taste has a slight initially boozy flavor, but that quickly fades to a heavy black coffee taste. Amazing. The darkest roast coffee you can imagine. Mouthfeel seems a bit thin for all the flavor that is crammed into this one. Hmm. Also seems a bit fizzy. If you like coffee stouts, then this can preety much hold it's own against the best. Well done. 668 charactersBigJTrucker, Sep 04, 2008

S - Coffee, and I mean coffee. Not necessarily fresh coffee, but ground coffee that's been sitting in the freezer for a couple weeks... or the bottom of a grinder. Alcohol on the back end, as well as some roasty malts that add a nice complexity.
T - Tastes a tad like the stale coffee I mentioned. Also noted is powdered cocoa, actual coffee beans, bittersweet chocolate, light vanilla. Reminds me of tiramisu. Hops play lightly in the back in the form of lasting bitterness, but could also have a bit to do with the coffee and dark malts. 
M - The mouthfeel sorta blows it for me. I was hoping for less-carbonated, much heavier, and creamier. What I got was a medium bodied, not-so-creamy, overly carbonated coffee drink. To its credit, when I swirl it in the glass, the carbonation is cut to the point where it's no longer sparkly.
D - Drinkability is good on this one, as it goes down easy, and has a wonderful taste. Another good transition brew for those that like coffee but don't really like beer.
Notes: I've had better coffee stouts... Not to say this one's bad, but for the price, I'll take Breakfast Stout for $12 a 4-pack as opposed to the $5 a bottle for this. 1,280 charactersSaucyA, Sep 02, 2008

I'm a big fan of stouts & coffee beers, so was looking forward to this one. Pours an expected black with a smell overwhelmingly of coffee, with a bit of vanilla as it warms a little. 
Taste is large part coffee, with the vanilla underneath & not much else. I like my beers a bit more complex, & this one fell short of a couple of my favorites. Good, not great. 
Mouthfeel is rich & full, with that thin coffee veneer overtop. Didn't live up to the hype for me, but a good beer, & I'm glad I got to try Peche Mortel 637 charactersmaximum12, Aug 29, 2008

Huge coffee aroma. Where's the cream and sugar? Also had notes of vanilla and roasted grains. Very nice aroma.
Taste was big, fresh coffee with notes of vanilla and chocolate. 
Very tasty beer. Definitely one I'd track down again. 410 charactersdrumrboy22, Aug 27, 2008
4.9/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I was looking forward to trying this beer for awhile. I loved it in the bottle but it was as close to perfect as you can get on tap. Excellent pour, jet black in color with a dark brown head thats on Viagra. Great lacing, everything you could ask for in a stout.
Smells of strong roasted coffee, bitter chocolates and more coffee!
Tastes of dark bitter chocolate, some hop bitterness (but the bitterness mostly comes from the malts) and obviously loads of coffee. This is easily one of the best beers I have ever had. 519 charactersirishkyle21, Aug 26, 2008
4.52/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Purchased a bottle at Julio's Liquors in Westborough, MA.
A: Opaque black hue. This beer looks dense and attractively opposing. Topped with a thin, though long lasting, dark tan head.
S: This beer has a huge decadent aroma. Pronounced roasted malt aroma. Has a distinct coffee and espresso character. Either the coffee or the hops add some specific bitterness in the aroma. Some perfume/floral alcohol notes, which isn't surprising in a beer of this strength. Esters add some dark fruit notes.
T: Quite boozy with perfume like fusel alcohols - but not hot. This does not get in the way of a well roasted malt flavor. Coffee like character is strong - espresso. Quite bitter on the back end. Very light but long lingering after taste that is dry. 
MF: Smooth velvety mouthfeel. Very low carbonation. Dry. Alcohol warming.
D, notes: This is a serious sipping beer meant to be savored slowly. Very smooth. The coffee character enhances all aspects of the beer and through the flavor. Smooth flavor shifts. bitterness is not acrid or harsh. I think this is a beer that lives up to its substantial hype. 1,103 charactersNipitato, Aug 25, 2008
4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Black, black, black, black, black. Humong-o four finger mocha-colored head that's foamy on the sides and puffy on top. Foamy lacing as it disipates.
S- Based on the nose and if I wouldn't be fired from my job, I would probably drink this in lieu of my coffee every morning. The nose is straight up coffee grounds.
T- (Copy the notes on the smell)Coffee + rich roasy stout = Peche Mortel. ...If I could start my day off with this, my job would be a hell of a lot more interesting.
M- Not nearly as full-bodied as I'd expected or hoped. Its like when you were a kid thinking that coffee was as thick as tar, but then you found out it was essentially just like tea, but with coffee beans. This is the one short stroke of this beer.
D- Like my coffee, I like to savor this one and enjoy it to the bottom of the glass. 820 charactersAvryle, Aug 25, 2008
4.6/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Just about jet black with some minor brown highlights when help up to light. Poured with about a half finger of mocha head. Decent lacing especially for the style.
S: Jesus christ this is all coffee. There is some roasted coffee behind it as well. Just kidding. Normal roast is there as well. Beyond the coffee you get espresso. I don't like the taste of coffee but I love the way it smells.
T: Starts off white a blast of chocolate which is did not see coming given the nose. Then it goes into the roasted bitterness from the coffee. Nice little sweetness break before it goes back into the bitterness.
M: Medium to heavy body. Not as thick as you would think. Carbonation is spot on.
D: Split the bottle which is fine. This is a great dessert/ eye opener beer. Not quite up to the Big Boss coffee stout but damn fine. Just want to shout out two traders who sent me this within a week as extras. RustyDiamond andswnicholson. Though the bottle I am drinking I got on my own as this is finally (sort of) available in NY.

Typical black color where a slight amount of light shines through on the edge of the glass. Great lasting head which coats the glass like a blanket. 
Coffee with cream is the predominant smell here...lots black patent malt. 
Like the smell, this is a milked coffee beer. Great body; simply superior in every way in that it provides a blend that, at a slower pace, is exquisite. 510 characterssmcolw, Aug 23, 2008

Poured an 11.5oz bottle into my New Belgium globe glass. This beer pours a jet black with a big 2 inch tan head that leaves just a little lacing on the glass. This beer is really dark. It reminds me of what coffee looks like after you've left the pot on the burner for 24 hours. The aroma is straightforward espresso, with just a hint of cream. The taste is spectacular. It reminds me of Starbucks Espresso Ice Cream. Huge coffee taste with cream, chocolate and just a hint of vanilla with a slight alcohol burn at the tail. This is a great tasting brew. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, leaving a nice coating in your mouth. This beer is so drinkable, I think I'll start popping one every morning instead of the pot of coffee I normally drink. This would go perfect with any breakfast. 824 charactershwwty4, Aug 23, 2008

A: One inch thick head coffee and creme colored head that leaves some nice sticky lacing. After a bit the head fades into a thin cap and ring but the lacing still remains. Black as night what else is there to say.
S: At first sort of just smells like wet coffee grounds but opens up a bit and lets loose with some nice vanilla and chocolate notes hints of nutmeg brown sugar and molasses, really some amazing stuff. 
T/MF: Wonderful blend of vanilla chocolate and fresh coffee, mouthfeel is just heavenly, creamy but balanced with the perfect amount of carbonation and coffee bitterness. The finish is almost as good as the initial taste and brings fresher and even chocolaty goodness. The longer you let this sit and breath the more these flavors become pronounced, the coffee becomes fresher and richer as does the chocolate and vanilla, a smoothed over beer geek breakfast and a much better beer in my opinion.
D: Just and amazing beer, not a five in taste as I feel there is just a pinch of room for improvement but it is something to behold and to drink, incredibly tasty and only Founders Kentucky Breakfast surpasses it for sheer coffee goodness. Just a joy to drink. 1,215 charactersbluemoonswoon, Aug 20, 2008
3.8/5  rDev -13.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours a huge 2 finger head with good retention and a very nice dark brown color. The retention is pretty exceptional as well.
Huge whiff of coffee on the nose that overpowers the dark malts underneath. There is a tiny bit of mint and citrusy underneath.
There is a pale sweetness and citrusyness/ minty throughout this beer. With that there is a swet chocolatey flavor and a roasted malt characteristic as well that provides a bittersweet chocolate flavor. There is a caramel malt sweetness in there too that creeps up as the beer warms. On the finish is a coffee bean bitterness and a bit of citrusy hops. The citrusy minty sweetness does die out a little bit, but I'd prefer a more robust characteristic to dominate.
There is a tiny bit of astringency to this beer. I want a more robust and creamy malting. There is too much citrusy/minty characteristic going on.
This beer is a good double stout, but I would like to have more robust malts and maybe more coffee going on. That's two for two on this style that I've had this problem with. Still it's not overly bad and I'd have this beer again.
Thanks to Deuane for the sample. 1,134 charactersjasonjlewis, Aug 18, 2008
4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours to a thin, creamy tan head and virtually opaque ruby-black color. Aroma is of freshly ground dark-roasted coffee, roasted barly and caramel malts. There is also vanilla and yeast esters peeking through in the smell. Flavor is coffee and chocolate malt dominant with some hop and roast bitterness balancing the sweetness of the generous portions of malt in this recipe. the flavors work well together and are very strong. Mouthfeel is full-bodied. aModerately low CO2 enhances the coffee experience. Finishes with a strong espresso aftertaste. This is s beer for coffee-lovers and one of the finest beers to have with dessert, or as a dessert itself. 655 charactersBrewAskew, Aug 17, 2008
4.6/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from the 11.5oz bottle into a Belgian style wine glass.
Appearance- Beer pours a just brighter than black brown tone with a substantial one and a half finger head of creamy mocha foam. Lacing clings to the sides like nobody's business. Foam looks to be a bit darker round the edges than in the middle.
Smell- Lots of high quality coffee esters in there, they must have used a more premium blend of coffee than most java stouts. Rich milk chocolate (plausibly Belgian chocolate), Dark chocolate as well, hints of vanilla and coconut as well strangely enough. 
Taste- Oh, god in heaven. Creamy coffee and chocolates are amplified much more than in the smell. Hints of caramel linger at the back of the tongue. Bitter hoppiness that is not overdone, very smooth, I clearly chilled it too much, it tastes better the longer I hold it in my mouth. Slight vanilla bean and some sweetness, almost lactic? Perhaps raisins.
Mouthfeel- Thick and sticky, but I would still like to see it a little thicker. Still, the carbonation levels are excellent, and the body is full and big.
Drinkability- This is a great and drinkable beer, and worth the hype here on BA. If I had many more, I would drink many more. It's almost a perfect excuse to go to Quebec. 1,252 charactersblakesell, Aug 16, 2008

Smell- COFFEE. The coffee aroma dominated but there were slight hints of chocolate.
Taste- Again with the coffee. More pronounced as an espresso style coffee with subtle hints of chocolate and perhaps raisins and toffee. Had a nice smokey flavor as well.
Mouthfeel- Thick and creamy. Little to no carbonation.
Overall- A great brew that is well suited as an after dinner beer. I don't like coffee but I couldn't let that cloud my judgement of this beer. Overall this beer was fantastic but something I wouldn't drink again because of my personal dislike of coffee. 729 charactersBeerbuddha, Aug 16, 2008
4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks so much for this bottle Kegatron! I did not expect this one to show up!
12 oz bottle poured into a snifter at 45 degrees. Deep dark abyss of black coffee with dark tan tiny bubbled head. Very frothy and pillowy. Good lacing with a small ring of lace that stays present all the way through.
The aroma is quite simply AMAZING. Coffee is in the forefront, but there is more depth. We get roasted malt and smoke here as well, with a bit of a sting from the hops. There's some alcoholic cherries here as well.
Tastes outstanding. I am very impressed with the complex nature of this beer. Yes, there is a ton of coffee, it's true! I love bitter coffee, but it's not all bitterness! There is a lovely sweetness up front like a mocha, followed by smoke that melds things into the coffee bitterness. This combines with the alcohol taste to form a tart cherry vanilla finish.
I love the feel as well. It's a little fizzy at first, but quickly fades into a smooth and robust feel without being overly oily. Feels soft in the mouth almost like velvet.
Drinkability is quite good. It's a very strong flavor so it's nice to savor it slowly, but the alcohol flavor is never apparent in raw form. The finishing swallow is surprisingly roasty and there is almost no sting or warming sensation here.
A real winner of an Imperial Stout! 1,330 charactersBubba83, Aug 15, 2008

Opaque ~ no light passes through this beer when back lit. Solid, foamy coffee colored 2 finger head that sticks to the side of the glass. Drippy, oily lacing..
S ~ Coffee, roasted coffee beans, coffee, espresso, coffee followed by dark chocolate, sweet malt, & smokey vanilla bean.
T ~ Spot on. Possibly the zenith of Imperial Coffee Stouts. A potent alcohol presence without the burn. BOLD, dark roasted coffee beans, bittersweet chocolate, smoke. For me ~ everything I was hoping for. Lots of depth.
M ~ Smooth & Creamy - Thick & Chewy.
Slightly bitter, with an astringent finish like a French Roast coffee. Ample carbonation with a touch of lingering resin or smokey oil on the lips.
D ~ Very pleasant & approachable for anyone who appreciates good coffee & good beer. Unfortunately, The ABV limits the drinkability.

4.28/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a deep black with brown highlights. Head is a thick coffee brown. It really looks like coffee... actually looks exactly like coffee. 
I found the aroma a little toned down for the actual flavours in the beer. Mostly you get a deep, burnt roasted aroma. Coffee certainly, but I found there was alot of roasted malt in there as well. 
Flavour is a bitter french roast. Coffee beans burnt to a crisp releasing a pungent roasted flavour. Amazingly the malt is able to poke its head through, providing a surprisingly fruity (albeit dark) backbone. The blend produces a pleasant almost vanilla flavour that brings everything together.
Excellent mouth feel. Carbonation was surprisingly high. Quite creamy and full bodied.
Right on stylistically no doubt... unfortunately the style isn't my favourite. Even so, I wouldn't turn this one down. 844 charactersCanuckRover, Aug 10, 2008
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at Dieu du Ciel Tuesday, August 5th, 2008. At 9.5% alcohol it's served in a tulip glass.
I arrived in Montreal at 11:30pm Tuesday night and after checking in to my hotel headed right over to DDC, hoping with all hope that this was on tap. Sure enough, beer number 15 out of 15 was Peche Mortel. This was the first time in many trips to DDC that they had the Peche running, and I wasn't about to squander my chance to thoroughly enjoy this beer.
Poured pitch black with the thickest, heaviest head I've ever had the privelidge of seeing atop a beer. The head stayed perfectly intact for what seemed an eternity, even as I swirled the beer around and took a few sips. Rich coffee aroma with some deep malt and tastes much the same. Mouthfeel was very smooth with some alcohol at the end. Very easy to drink, which was pretty dangerous due the high alcohol content and me coming off a five hour drive. A few hours of drinking these at the bar hit me pretty hard come last call, but it was all well worth it. 1,013 charactersfdrich29, Aug 09, 2008

4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A - Pours black and opaque. No light is able to get through on the sides. The tan head rose to just over half inch in height and stuck around for a bit. The resulting lace was nice. Looks like a good stout but could use a little more retention.
S - First to hit the nose is a a mix of espresso, smoke, and bittersweet chocolate. Once those start to fade, some roasted aromas make an appearance. The chocolate and coffee seamlessly blend to more of a latte aroma toward the end. Not very complex but quite pleasant.
T - Starts out big with coffee and a smooth smokiness. Roasted flavors are also big and contribute alot to this beer. Bittersweet chocolate and some dark fruit show up midway. Picked up some dried cherries. Warming alcohol finishes up the flavor. 
M - Pushing full bodied with good carbonation. Finish is thick, dry, and sticks around for a while.
D - Drinkability is good. It goes down easy enough for a beer this "big". Limit for me would be one bottle at a time given the abv. The alcohol could stand to be hidden a little more - which would shoot drinkability through the roof. Still, This is a very tasty brew that I will have again and again. Highly recommended. 1,187 characterscsmiley, Aug 08, 2008

today. Poured into a chalice (all I got).
A: Poured a thick, beautiful, black pour of goodness. This looks amazing. Got a burnt caramel colored head that has amazing retention and the damned stickiest lacing I have ever seen. This is all I ever wanted and more.
S: Smells of deeply, carefully roasted malt, great rich coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, a touch of hops and molasses. Good Christ.
T: Almost exactly like the nose. The big player here is the coffee. Stout coffee flavor well rounded with hops, semi sweet chocolate, honey, molasses, malt. This is truly great.
M: This is the definiton of a full bodied brew, made with love. Thick as oil, with a great after taste of coffee and chocolate. Can't taste an ounce of alcohol. The balance is damned perfect.
D: I could drink many of these right now, but I feel that may be a mistake. This beer is damned near perfect. If this beer was a woman, I would ask her out. She would absolutely turn me down, but I would buy her a car for her time. Ridiculous. 1,059 characterseveretends, Aug 07, 2008
4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle from ryscott in a trade - thanks! Poured into an Ommegang chalice.
Appearance: A gorgeous, deep black brew - perhaps some hints of brown - with a fairly fast-fading, deep, coffee-colored head. Very inviting (especially since I didn't have my coffee this morning!).
Aroma: Pungent. Grassy in places - either from the hops or the lightly roasted coffee beans - and chocolatey in others - not sweet, milky chocolate but also not bitter chocolate, just a really nice in-between chocolate flavor. Everything reeks of coffee, however, in a good way. Light alcohol notes.
Taste: Heeere's coffee! A full range of notes, really: light, grassy, acidic, and citric half-roast; slightly darker, fuller, Viennese roast; and smoky, highly roasted (even burnt) Italian overtones. Some sweet chocolate bitterness, but it's also milky and creamy in places. No alcohol, no bitter astringencies - like a delicious coffee java milkshake in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Big bodied and fluffy, even and creamy. Medium-sized bubbles. Near perfect.
Drinkability: Turns out I didn't need my coffee this morning! The best coffee-infused beer I've ever had. Absolutely delicious, and it really covers the full range of potential coffee notes you can get from a beer, from dark to light, sweet to bitter, refreshing to warming. A really excellently crafted beer. 1,340 charactersCrellMoset, Aug 07, 2008
4.09/5  rDev -7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance - Was expecting much more. Poured very thin and syrupy. Not much head to speak of at all, maybe half a finger at most. Beer is a midnight black with a tan miniature topping. Small circles of lacing cling to the glass when you tilt.
Smell - This beer does not hold back in the aroma catagory. Huge boot to the head with an espresso shoe. Chocolate flavors are noticeable as well, but it's a very bitter chocolate.
Taste & Mouthfeel - A surprising amount of layers to this one if you can somehow make it past the robust and palate crushing espresso taste. Very tight amount of carbonation gives a nice bite before the sweet smoothness wins out. The longer it warms it balances out to intertwine with the sweet chocolate very well. Don't get me wrong the bitter espresso never leaves, but it does have a nice sweet side to it. Awesome as hell how the burnt taste numbs the tongue after awhile.
Drinkability - There is no doubt that this beer achieves it goal as the mother of all coffee stouts. Yeah it can be overwhelming at times, but thats exactly what this beer is about. Could I have one every night? No, but when the mood strikes for a coffee infused beer there are no substitutes. 1,198 charactersryrust5301, Aug 06, 2008

4.41/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Not sure when it was brewed; just says "Peche Mortel was born in a Montreal brewpub in 2001."
Pours pretty much black as can be, no hints or hues, a huge fluffy three inch head, slightly bubbly, lacing in bubbles and blobs. The first hit in aroma is fresh roasted coffee beans, and very good ones too. Add in some milk chocolate, some more roasted malt, a shade of caramel, and you've got aromatic wonder.
The mouth is nicely carbonated, yet smooth and silky, works just right with the roasted malt and coffee interplay. And its just slightly warm, just a hint. The bitterness of the roasted malt and coffee jumps out at first, then settles in with the milky chocolates rolling past the palate, and some faint, sweet caramels coating, and the bittering never quite ceasing, but leaving its impression.
My impression is that its just a tad too bitter for its own good. I like it a ton, but it just isn't quite right for me. But, for all the effort it took to finally haul in this one, it was worth it. A fine, fine beer. 1,022 charactersobjectivemonkey, Aug 06, 2008
4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Picked up a couple of bottles in Maine when I was there, JUST before they became available in Georgia. Oh well. Poured black with a healthy dark tan head that settled to a cap. Some lacing as well. Nice aroma of ground coffee in the nose, as well as a touch of dark fruit. Taste is similar- lots of ground coffee, some dark fruit, and a tiny bit of molasses sweetness. Overall, though, this is more bitter than sweet, and much more like black coffee than some with cream. That is unfortunate, because I really like the coffee stouts with a touch of creaminess to round out the coffee bitterness and acidity, and because the quality of the coffee used in coffee stouts, while often good is not always absolutely top notch. I'll drink my coffee black if it is something like Batdorf and Bronson Sumatra Tarwar, but if it is something less robust and more acidic, I like a little cream. Perhaps it is that the freshness of the aromatics in coffee are even more fleeting than those in hops, and that almost no one gets it just right and captures the balance and complexity of a really great cup of coffee in a stout. Those that do tend to have a creamy finish and more noticeable malt than this one has, or to have a winey complexity that goes beyond just "dark fruit". This is good, but for me it is not the alpha and omega of coffee stouts. Mouthfeel is substantial, but overall this brew is a bit too one dimensional- though it does have power. It also nicely disguises the alcohol. 1,481 charactersGeorgiabeer, Aug 06, 2008

He only comes out when I leave the good stuff unattended. Full bodied with a roasted malt, bitter chocolate and coffee finish.

A nice roasted burnt aroma, some coffee, aroma is not strong though.
Nice roasted flavors and burnt flavors in this. Coffee, dark chocolate and roastedness abound. A bit of alcohol present. 
Mouthfeel smooth and silky. 
The tastes and mouthfeel come together for a really pleasurable experience here. However I wasn't as blown away as I thought I would be considering how highly this beer is rated. On par with some other excellent stouts I've had, actually reminded me of Bell's Java Stout, which I also enjoyed immensely. 577 charactersStrix, Aug 04, 2008

Smells of roasted coffee & a distinct cocao aroma. Nice.
Rich chocolate flavor & a huge coffee presence. Nice bitterness balanced by the roasted/toasted flavors. Delicious.
A bit more carbonated than I expected. Doesn't effect the feel for me. Still quite smooth with a lingering bitterness.
A fine example of a coffee stout. From Montreal huh? Look forward to trying more from this brewery. Seek this on eout. Stands up to all from the style IMO. 537 charactersbbothen, Aug 03, 2008

Appearance: Foamy thick tan head that looks like froth almost, concentration of bubbles in the center, slowly bubbling almost looks like its alive. pitch black, medium looking viscosity and somewhat thin lacing.
Smell: The smell of coffee is overwhelming, the first noticable thing like raw grinds fresh out of the grinder. THere is also some tobacco in here, a little smoke. im not getting any fruit at all.
Taste: Extremely rich and dark, big time coffee obviously this tastes like a dark coffee beer shake. Well balanced with coffee throughout the whole experience then some leathery flavors on the finish.
Overall: This is a hell of a coffee beer, it reeks of coffee and coffee flavor just runs throughout it. As one of the best in the world.... well it is if you like coffee, I do so I found it very enjoyable. 893 charactersYankChef, Jul 31, 2008

Pours thick and pitch black, producing nearly two fingers of soft chocolate brown head. The head receded slowly leaving behind some nice lacing around the glass. Intense aromas of chocolate (both milk and dark) and roasted coffee/espresso. Incredible.
The taste follows the aroma quite nicely. Up front are flavors of sweet milk chocolate and roasted coffee. The back end is bitter dark chocolate, more roasted coffee, and a faint bitter hop presence. The coffee flavor really is quite amazing, as is the chocolate that joins in.
The feel is also very nice. The carbonation is a tad high, and it's slightly thin. But it's still very smooth and creamy with a fairly full body. As it warmed, it got smoother and didn't seem as thin. Drinkability is also great. The high ABV (9.5%) is very well hidden, and the bitterness doesn't overwhelm.
Excellent coffee stout. The only downsides are the feel (when cold) and the high price (~$5). If you like coffee or stouts at all, definitely try this - it's amazing. 1,065 charactersbkilpatr, Jul 29, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +13%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Recommended by the bartender Joe at David Copperfield's in Manhattan.
As dark as a beer can be with a quickly dissapating head. The aroma is all coffee as is the taste. Very complex and very creamy without an overwhelming roasted character. So complex, that I can't really provide details. The mouthfeel is smooth with low carbonation, and the flavors get better as the beer warms. There isn't much of an alcohol presence, which along with the intense flavors, makes the drinkability ridiculous. If you enjoy coffee, this stout cannot be missed. One of my favorite Imperial Stouts so far and very unique.
Unfortunately got scammed into paying $18 for the 12oz. bottle so that's the last time I'm drinking a bottle of beer at a bar. Anywhere. 743 charactersGatch, Jul 28, 2008

This beer pours dark black with a small head that disappeared quickly. The smell and taste is overwhelming complex and it is difficult to pick out the various coffee flavors. The mouthfeel is creamy and nicely carbonated. The after taste is bitter. The drinkability is high on this one considering the high abv. I could easily see drinking two or three of these if this was readily available to me. By far my favorite coffee stout. 469 charactersjohnd513, Jul 28, 2008

A- Pours thick and pitch black with a thin, but persistent head.
S- Coffee! and roasted malt. Hints of unsweetened cocoa come through as well.
T- Intense roasted coffee flavor. The roasty-bitterness blends well and integrates into the mild hop bitterness. Cocoa and caramelized sugar also have a clear presence. As the beer warms, the cocoa becomes more pronounced and the flavor sweetens slightly.
M- Thick, carbonated, rich, and fantastic with a surprisingly dry finish.
D- Surprisingly drinkable, although you need to sip at it 607 charactersJoeMayo, Jul 27, 2008
4.57/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours opaque jet black, with the merest hint of the suggestion of red highlights at the edges. Tan, almost reddish head that disappears into a lingering film. Aroma: notes of coffee, rum, port, roast malt, with hazelnut and dark chocolate as it warms. Flavour: strong coffee flavour, complemented by a nicely balanced sweetness. Plenty of dark roasty bite, but not unpleasantly astringent. Finishes with plenty of dark chocolate nuttiness. Port. For a beer this strong, it hides its alcohol well. Until it warms up, I would never have put this beer at 9.5. Not at all harsh, even when the alcohol starts to come out. Chocolate milkshake mouthfeel. Just enough carbonation to enliven it. Wonderful. 697 charactersKaiMiller, Jul 27, 2008
3.85/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5I debated pouring it into a coffee mug, but ultimately decided on a snifter (Please note that this is extreme sarcasm). I've been looking forward to trying this one as I am a black unsweetened coffee fan.
This double stout pours an opaque motor oil black. I can clearly see a reflection of myself as I hold it up for inspection. A fairly vigorous pour releases a large frothy head that manages to hold a sharp looking cap. A good amount of thick rings left on the glass, which is rare for these big stouts.
My nose is filled of roasted malts and a bitter coffee. Further inspection reveals chocolate. The aromatic hops blend well with the coffee characteristics and it's difficult to separate the two.
Bitter coffee and roasted flavors dominate here again. Very dry taste, with a bitter cocoa quality. It must be mentioned that there is a lack of depth and complexity. The flavor is short, up front and very bold. This said it isn't some sort of coffee alcoholic drink. The hops and roasted qualities are unique and interesting, but everything happens quickly and fades fast. I did have higher expectations.
Mouthfeel is creamy and the carbonation consists of many fine bubbles. Really enhances the coffee bitterness. Drinkability is tough to rate for such a big and bold beer, but given the relative price and expectations the drinkability is only a shade above average. I can't complain overall, but I expected more. Worth a try for its unique qualities. 1,460 charactersJmamay22, Jul 26, 2008
3.27/5  rDev -25.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 2It's like pouring motor oil from a beer bottle. A bottle with a cool label I might add (artsy medusa lady on the front). Rich mocha aroma with lots of black malt in there as well. Short, dense, light brown head covers the beer. Rich, potent, bitter flavor. Lots of astringent dark malt, coffee grinds, and even some cocoa. Finishes with a bitter ashy flavor. The mouthfeel is crisp and faily light for such a strong beer. Not to be a whiner, but it's too damn bitter. It wasn't that cold, but I'm going to let it warm up and bit and see if it mellows because it's pretty harsh right now...
Ok, well it's almost an hour later and it has mellowed quite nicely. The flavors go together smoothly and don't bash your tongue. All except for that bitter/astringent flavor that still dominates and leaves an ashy aftertaste. Even without considering the price I think this will be my last Peche Mortel. 895 charactersHappyHourHero, Jul 24, 2008
4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This one pours very dark, with only a hint of light on the fringe. It also has a reasonable brown head to it. The aroma is coffee all over the place. There is some dark-malt roastiness to it as well, but strong coffee is really what this beer is all about. 
Bitter coffee is what this is all about as well. There is some warming alcohol to it as well especially on the finish, and a hint of sweetness underneath it all which does just enough to prevent the coffee from being too pervasive. It's definitely a good coffee stout, but it doesn't overly impress me. It has a very creamy mouthfeel with excellent carbonation. For coffee fans, this is excellent. 656 charactersASymon13, Jul 24, 2008

S: Coffee is quite strong, with hints of smokiness. There's an underlying hint of sweetness, fig perhaps?
T: Strong french press coffee flavors up front, dark malts and a hint of malt bitterness in the background.

 Opaque darkness with a two-finger deep crown, clumpy and dense brown froth that is active in the middle, thick and rocky around the edges. Massive clumps of lacing.
 The nose has peanutbutter, smokey coffee, heavy chocolate mocha with vanilla, chocolate cheesecake with a slight hint of blackberries.
 The flavor is a big, chunky and sweet chocolate and peanutbutter malt at first and a big current of semi-bitter ground coffee and cream. More sweetness pops out, with honey in the malt which is balanced with subtle earthy hops. Chocolate covered coffee beans and a rather woody, smokey heat rides in at the last minute. Overall, thickly sweet and roastie around the edges.
 Big-full bodied, thick and creamy with a medium middle and smooth finish.
 This one has a very authentic coffee flavor that plays with the chocolate currents very well.I don't think you'll find this one hard to drink. 934 charactersGratefulBeerGuy, Jul 23, 2008

4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I could have had a bottle of this for $2 at Whole Foods, but decided to be honest when they wanted to charge me that much and had them do a price check. Maybe wasn't "worth" it, but I probably would have felt guilty afterward.
Poured into a Duvel tulip. Suitably viscous, opaque black with a wonderful mocha head that fit to the rim of the tulip perfectly. Ring of mocha maintained well and left intermittent lacing. 
Very nice aroma of medium espresso, but not too acrid. Good blend of chocolate and a little smoke.
Slight bitterness up front, and again pronounced coffee flavor, but well blended with the roasted bitterness and sweetness. For a heavy brew, the mouthfeel is lighter than it looks, though not thin. After a few sips, the alcohol begins to accumulate in the esophagus, but still quite appropriate. Adds a nice layer. Finishes pretty clean all considered.
Does not require extensively slow drinking, as the balance is very nice, but obviously should be. The flavors don't "open up" as much as I might expect as it warms. Preferred the flavors on the slightly colder side on this one. 
I wanted a change of pace after months of drinking lighter lagers and IPAs. This was a nice welcome interruption. 1,218 charactersunklesyd, Jul 22, 2008

A smooth special dark roast, vanilla, a splash of real cream, chocolate sauce and a kick of whiskey. I wanted a square of cake. It all comes together so well.

Appearance notable by the very thick body, leaves a light brown coating on the glass as it is swirled.
This beer has a huge roast aroma, like an American stout but without the hops. Big coffee note behind the roasted malt.
This one stands out from the others in the round by the intense coffee flavor. Hard to detect anything else, and that's not in a bad way.
It's got nice, thick body and substantial carbonation, superb mouthfeel.
This beer is really a treat. Can drink it all day, despite the dense body and strong coffee dominance. A real stand-out. 665 charactersBattleRoadBrewer, Jul 19, 2008
4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Dark sludgy maroon chocolate brown. Or fudgey black unless there is strong back-lighting involved. The head is an impressively tall and thick mocha brown that dwindles semi-quickly to a lowly skimming. 
Intense creamed coffee nose, with elements of acrid espresso, molten fudge confections, boozey port and Bourbon notes, and nuances of blackberries, liquorice, and charcoal. 
The malt slides across the tongue. Silky at first with vanilla-tinged, caramel-chocolate candies. Coffee slinks close behind, rasping bitter beans and dark roasted suave abrasiveness. The middle finds burnt heavy cream and a coagulating dark fruit muddle, with cherries, multi-colored berries, and prunes, along with a pervasive smoked everything. This segues into a very like-minded booze-drenched closure full of whiskies of various national origins (but primarily maritime peat-rich Scotland and Kentucky, USA), and a more potent and defined port fortified grapiness. Spent coffee grounds are picked up again on the finish, and go on seemingly forever 
This strikes a crucial balance amongst its bitter coffee, fruity sweet, and boozy traits. None can claim superiority or dominance, as each is given it's full turn, and each makes the most of it.
It's not the thickest of Imperial Stouts, but the nearly full body is given some lift and support by the low-level, steady carbonation. The potency of flavors (including, especially, booze) might point this towards slow, savoring, sips. But the body perks it up enough to make it nearly downable and dangerous. 
This delivers the goods, and while not cheap at slightly more than $4 a bottle (11.5 oz), it's not the bankbreaker it once was when bombers pushed upwards of $15. In fact, it's close to a steal at this price, as it rivals the best in its class. 1,784 characterscokes, Jul 18, 2008

Big thick chewy mouth. This one smacks you across the face with the coffee smell and never lets go.

This beer pours pitch black with a tan colored head that recedes at an average pace, leaving a thin cap on the beer till the glass is empty. 
Wow. Coffee, coffee, and more coffee. This might just be the strongest individual aroma I've come across in a beer. Smells like I'm walking down the coffee aisle at the market. 
Same thing in the taste. This is carbonated coffee. Whatever else is in this beer is completely dominated by the coffee, including the 9.5% alcohol. Very good stuff. 
Mouthfeel is pretty thick and viscous, but still has a nice carbonation bite.

deep aromas of dark roasted coffe a bit of bourbon and maybe hints of unsweetened coacoa
vanilla, LOTS of coffee flavor but they sit on the roasted malt and declare "I AM COFFEE" there is beautiful complexity to this beer, there is an awesome complexity to this beer. just a bit of dark chocolate. Peche is a dark and mysterious mistress, she will lure you in and then damn you to hell. Amazing 
the mouthfeel is as smooth as silk, nicely carbonated, full bodied but doesn't even feel that way. 
so drinkable, I wish I could wake up and drink this every morning. I would love to try pairing this up with some good breakfast items I'm thinking french toast, sausage, hashbrowns.
If I where going to go to hell for drinking this beer I don't think I would care, it's that good. 832 charactersDonnie2112, Jul 17, 2008

This beer is black as black can get. Pours with a nice thick tan head, that stuck around quite a while, and leaves some lacing on the glass.
Smells like coffee. And not Folgers Crystals. This smells like good roasted coffee beans. I smelled this for a good full minute before I even managed a sip.
Tastes like coffee, with stout in it, but not in a bad way. In the way that they belong together perfectly. This is the best coffee stout I've ever had, by a landslide.
After I was finished with this one, I didn't want to lose the flavor in my mouth. I waited a good half hour before finally moving on to something else. I put a few of these in the cellar, and can't wait to pour another one of these on a cold winter's day. 776 characterscubbyswans, Jul 16, 2008
4.36/5  rDev -0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams tasting glass.
The beer pours out a very dark brown that is almost opaque expect for the edges. There is a fairly substantial medium brown head that later falls to a thin beige layer of bubbles. Belgian lace is left all along the glass. The aroma is all about coffee and roasted grains.
The taste is smooth and creamy dark fruit and bitter chocolate up front with a strong roasted grain and coffee bitterness at the back of the swallow. Even though coffee stouts are not my favorite, this one does not blast you with so much coffee that you lose everything else. This beer has a nice mix of coffee and roasted flavors.
The mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation.
This is a very drinkable and pleasing coffee stout. I remember this going down easy last April on a cold Dark Lord morning at Three Floyds. Very nice. 869 characterswestweasel, Jul 16, 2008

This pours a deep pitch black with a finger of beige head when poured into a large snifter. Lace sticks to the sides of the glass like boil over foam on the sides of a brew kettle. Head dissipates down to swirls and contrails of bubbles. The aroma is of sweet malts and iced Sumatra coffee; it's like mixing sweet wort with your morning brew then throwing it in the fridge to enjoy once it's cooled. The taste is like the aroma, sweet coffee with bitter hints of espresso. I pick up very faint chocolate flavor, but for only a split second then it evaporates away like somebody threw a quad shot of espresso at an ethereal apparition. This is outstandingly well balanced between the caramelized sugar flavor & coffee, with the coffee riding out the taste buds for an outstanding aftertaste. Wow, it's hard to imagine that there's any alcohol in this brew, let alone 9.5%. This is one of the smoothest drinking stouts that I've had, and that's helped with a nice medium mouthfeel and light effervescent carbonation that sticks around till the end. This amazing stout has truly lived up to my anticipation, it's not just hype, it's damn near perfect in my opinion. 1,353 charactersirishmoss, Jul 15, 2008

4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I've been anticipating this one for a little while now. Traded one in person with CBA while up in Canada, and then ended up finding a bottle while in DC, so I've cracked that one for review while the other sits in the cellar. 
A: Jet black... suitable for a 'coffee stout.' Head on here is HUGE and lasts into eternity. Medium sized bubbles are the only thing that keep it from being a silky cream. Very nice. 
S: A nice, smooth, iced French Roast. A nod towards espresso aromas, and a fine, creamy chocolate scent. 
T: A prime example of what a coffee stout should be, as far as I'm concerned. I don't know if I'd go QUITE so far as to say espresso, but certainly a fine dark roasted coffee. Little hints of the malts beneath it all sneak through, offering a touch of flavour diversity. Some hints of raisin sweetness and a light chocolate to top it off. Outstanding.
M + D: Rich, and just creamy enough for the style / flavours. The finish lingers on the palate forever, allowing each sip to be savoured for quite some time. An excellent beer, I prefer it over some others of a similar style such as Alesmith's Speedway Stout or Southern Tier's Jah-va. ABV makes it a sipper, but it's a challenge! 1,203 charactersProteus93, Jul 14, 2008

regal, rich, and oh so inviting aroma of perfectly balanced coffee and malt, with subtle hops
starts with the roasted malt, then the coffee begins and never lets go, yet never gets aggressive or overpowering; it just creates a silky smooth coating on your tongue. the dry malt, slight dark (bitterish yet delicious) chocolate and caramel notes and accentuated by a crisp slight slight citrus hop notes to finish it all out. i feel like some dried fruits are trying to come out as well
silky smooth, medium bodied or so, no trace of the alcohol, and just lasts and lasts with all the flavors and sensations righteously sticking to your taste buds. every sip leads to more discoveries
by far one of the nicest stouts I've had in recent memory. a silky smooth layer of rich yet balanced coffee starts it all out and continues to the long finish all the while never losing any balance with the malt, hops, and other delightful undertones. if you see this beer, buy it! 1,011 charactersbitterthebetter, Jul 13, 2008
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I see why this beer is so highly regarded! It has a very nice thick rich sweetness that mingles with the coffee but is never overrun by it. The problem with large coffee beers, in my experience, is that they tend to become Starbucks drinks. This one teeters near that edge but doesn't fall over it, which is impressive. The malts are incredibly thick and rich, the mouthfeel is just luscious. There is a nice sweet malt backbone providing a bit of dark chocolate that mingles with the nice coffee flavors to produce a fine drink. The alcohol helps the acidic coffee finish dry the very sweet beer out, allowing for the next sip. A very nice concoction that, despite everything, is fairly straightforward. There is a slight note of oxidation in the bottle, which possibly suggests that it is a bit older, but the liquor store I bought it at is known for its quality control so I am forced to conclude that it is the brewer's fault. A very good beer, though ultimately a little one-dimensional. 992 charactersshbobdb, Jul 13, 2008
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4The beer pours a deep black color with a thick frothy tan/brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a nice coffee infused earthiness that lends itself nicely with the black malts. It's quite dry and bitter. The taste is good. It's smooth, but with a dry earthy finish. The coffee and patent malts create a very bitter flavor that would be a little easier to swallow with some chocolate malts. The mouthfeel is decent. It's a full bodied beer, but I would have liked a bit more body. It seems a little thin for a BIG beer. This is a very tastey beer. I love that Canada is brewing some world class craft beers. My hats off to them. Thanks to jjayjaye for the opportunity to try this one. 711 charactersWesWes, Jul 12, 2008

Pours black and completely opaque with a large mocha colored head sitting on top. Good retention.
Aroma is delicious. Black coffee, roasted beans, A slight sweetnes and some alcohol.
Taste is great. A big black coffee bitterness throughout. Like chewing on coffee beans, alcohol is hidden extremely well.
Mouthfeel is full bodied and lightly carbonated. Would have liked it to be slightly thicker.
Drinkability is fairly high. Great flavors make for easy consumption. I could drink coffee all day, but I'd rather it be beer so this works out great. 598 charactersGoliath, Jul 12, 2008

Another perfect replica of one hell of a giant shot of espresso. The head is thick and clings very tightly to the side of the glass. We are off to a great start...
Smells of fresh coffee grounds and sweet cream. There is also a mellow smoky vanilla smell that reminds me very much of the pipe tobacco my grandfather smoked. Dark chocolate bitterness also hits the nose. Lots of strong inviting smells really draw you in!
Taste is fresh, strong, bitter Italian espresso followed by semi-sweet chocolate and rich cream. Amazingly smooth on the tongue and although the alcohol instantly warms you, it is in now way noticeable and in fact hides extremely well. All those great smells come out in the taste and provide for a very enjoyable and satisfying beer. 
Actually, that is an understatement. This beer is truly incredible. Péché Mortel is one of those rare beers that lives 
up to all the hype. Santé! 980 charactersindiapaleale, Jul 12, 2008

Smell is amazing fresh coffee, chocolate, and earth. This beer is very different from other coffee beers I've had. The coffee is dominating, almost to the point of eating a coffee bean. Flavor is roasted and it grows quickly and powerfully. Bitter chocolate backs up the java nicely. The taste of coffee stays and is a welcome guest; this beer rocks it. 534 charactersgonzogambler, Jul 12, 2008
4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured to a pint glass from an 11.5 oz. bottle. Notching code on the label's right edge seems to indicate '0' and '0'; of course, I have no idea what this means. This one came from the fridge and warmed about 30 minutes before serving.
A: Pours completely black, not the faintest bit of light penetrating. An ill-advised vigorous pour filled the glass with little beer and over four fingers of frothy sandy-tan head. Then the waiting begins...very s-l-o-o-o-w-w-w-w to recede, with each passing second the head becomes denser and rockier, like a fluffy meringue. Finally settles to concave half-finger of cream and trails in wide sheets of fine sparkling bits. A masterpiece.
S: Robust and chocolate-filled, dark and bittersweet. Nose is intensely roasted (coffee builds), but has a light blanketing sweetness, like powdered sugar, and hints of ripe pit fruit and vanilla.
T: Oh my - what a beautiful melding of dark chocolate and rich coffee! Not a bit of sticky sweet syrupiness or acrid coffee, this is all about the finest, richest cacao and freshest ground beans. Vague taces of vanilla and a touch of woody sourness come and go, and harsher bitterness lurks at times (but is vanquished temporarily with each new sip). 
M: Thick and luscious, blanketing the mouth with a lasting bittering. Carbonation isn't noticeable, nor is the alcohol. Well ok, the alcohol IS there, but it's refined and subtly warming. 
D: Sure it's a big beer, weighing in at 9.5%, but its remarkably drinkable. Wonderful appearance, complex yet balanced flavor - it's a gorgeous and special beer. Highly recommend and one I'm glad is finally accessible here in Oregon.
Merci beaucoup, Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel! 1,693 charactersmsubulldog25, Jul 08, 2008
4.67/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Appearance - very dark pour, no light getting through the glass. A creamy mocha head that forms a rootbeer float head on top, lots of lace columns around the outside glass wall.
Aroma - rich roasted coffee leaps from the glass, in aromatic form that is. Zoing, another caffeine bomb just before midnight, when will I learn?!? Nice chocolate syrup aromas coming out with some warmth.
Taste - burnt grain smacks the tastebuds around right away along with a jalepeno pepper flavor I often associate with the burnt-tasting beers. Followed up by a rich intense coffee with a warm alcohol rider. On the swallow, a touch of sweetness, some returning malt flavor that has an element of roast to it instead of full on char. Roasted coffee aftertaste, very lengthy and what stuck in my mind from the smallest of sips at Flossmoor station the night before DLD08. Bitter chocolate shows up before long, adding to the profile nicely. Aside from the excessive char, over-burned brews usually top out at 4.0 for me, but there is such an intensity of other things in here that I like, that I find myself dwelling on those elements despite.
Mouthfeel - very carbonated, smooth but not the bigger body I had in mind.
Drinkability - the other bottle will get some cellar time. I know it will affect the coffee flavors but I want to see what it also does to the char. As is, a fine brew that earns its rank. Disappeared way too fast for me, palate adjustment and warming make this one outstanding. 1,481 charactersbrewdlyhooked13, Jul 08, 2008

A-Deep, dark and mysterious! Served with a HUGE billowing mocha head that reduced to nice cap that left behind generous lace.
S-Rich roasty malts swirl with COFFEE and hints of chocolate....sniffing hard as the head kinda gets in the way!
T-KA-BOOM!! Rich and luscious! Massive blasts of dark roast coffee collide with roasted malt and bites of bitterness from the hops and a bit of dark cocoa chocolate in the background. This has just about everything in a coffee stout I could ask for.
M-Medium-heavy body with smooth creaminess one cannot began to understand till you have it from the tap.
D-What can I say...the ONLY beer during our marathon tasting evening that I had TWO of! This stuff is crazy good...but you best be ready for a coffee and roast assault.

4.05/5  rDev -8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours out a murky, pitch black with a good-sized brown head. The head is very slow to fade, and leaves copious lacing.
Aroma is noticeable coffee, a slight hazelnut, dark chocolate, roasted malts. The coffee is dominant, but not dominating - you can tell it's the lead, but it doesn't suffocate the other aromas.
Coffee is the main taste, but not the taste of warm, fresh brew - it's more of a reheated, half-day-old coffee. Some roasted malt taste, but it is overwhelmingly coffee, a lasting bitterness that, if it were coffee, would lead me to pour it out and brew a new cup. It's unfortunate the taste did not match the aroma, or else it would be a quite impressive brew.
Nice, solid, heavy body. Higher carbonation than usual, but not so much as to knock it far out of whack.
Overall decent drinkability. Not something I'd drink on a daily basis, but a good treat every once in a while. 894 charactersDrewcifer, Jul 03, 2008

Sticking my nose in the Rapscallion sniffer results in a nice roasted coffee smell and a bit of vanilla.
I've been looking forward to this beer for awhile to see how it holds up to other big Imperial stouts. Nice full mouth feel. Taste is initially a bit alcoholy, giving way to expresso and chocolate notes. It finishes with some vanilla and more alcohol. This is a big malty beer. There is a strange estery bitter taste that hangs on throughout. The 9.5% alcohol is definitely there throughout. 
I think this beer will mellow a bit with age. I would love to try this again in a years time. Im a little torn on Peche Mortel, its a good beer, its a big beer but it needs some time to balance out before it can be considered in the same league as the big boys. 891 charactersthe_beerist, Jul 03, 2008

4.44/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4After a slow pour a black brew with hues of ruby is topped off by a thin dark tan head that fades fairly quickly with some jagged and clingy lacing left behind. Plenty of complex aromas here with deep roasted malts and burnt wood up front, roasted almonds, cigar smoke and dark chocolates in the middle, and some caramel and a bit of breadiness in the back. The taste is incredibly smooth yet complex and fulfilling with big roasted malts up front that are mixed in with dark and sweet chocolates, coffee, some dark fruits, and a sweet and spicy middle. The palate is left with a nice lingering essence of hops and maybe a slight bit of cream for the coffee. Mouth-feel is full bodied yet drinkable despite the alcohol content and somewhat crisp at times despite the aforementioned creamy quality. Carbonation is active more so than most stouts of this magnitude. This is a brew is one to be savored and respected. 914 charactersstephens101, Jul 02, 2008
4.03/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle into wide-mouth glass, like most everyone else.
Let me start off by saying that this is a wonderful beer, and I have very little to say in the realm of criticism against it. However, it really did nothing for me beyond the level of "very good" to take it to the level of "outstanding".
A - The beer looks wonderful. Deep black with a fetching mocha head. Lacing is present but not overwhelming.
S - Coffee and roastiness, are the dominant aromas, but nothing is too overwhelming here. It certainly doesn't smell like it's a beer, or a cup of coffee, even. Extremely mild aromas overall. Couldn't quite figure out what was going on.
T - Stout sweetness prevails here, with coffee bitterness being the main complimentary flavor. Very pleasant, but nothing like FBS, BCS, DL, or other imperial stouts that I've fallen in love with. There's chocolate, maybe a little caramel or molasses here.
M&D - Thick, but not as thick as something like ST's Choklat or Dark Lord. Certainly not thin, either, but with a decent amount of carbonation. I'd compare it to Left Hand's Milk Stout as far as overall body goes. This is certainly a drinkable beer, but if I'm in the midst of a night of fine beer sampling, I don't know if I wouldn't want to try something else instead of having another go at this. Again, a mighty fine beer, but nothing that I would place in the highest echelons of beerdom, or stoutdom. 1,407 charactersbainard, Jul 01, 2008

Pours a solid black that lets no light through. Has a large fluffy mocha/tan head that subsides quickly, but laces the glass on the way down. Aroma is roasted coffee with some flowery hops distant in the background. Taste is heavy on the coffee, with some mocha hiding in there as well. A roasted bitterness consumes your mouth after each sip. Carbonation is a bit high for the style, but lends to a creaminess that offsets the bitter coffee. You need to like coffee flavors to like this one because that flavor is intense here. I enjoyed drinking this. 620 charactersjohnnnniee, Jun 29, 2008

Pours a rich black color with a thick, creamy, brown head. Thick lacing on the glass.
Aroma is rather sharp and initially smells like burned coffee. Gives way to a large herbal hop smell and some lesser roasted malt and chocolate tones.
Huge bitterness upfront, both from the hops and coffee astringency. Lots of herbal hops and coffee and only a hint of the roated malts. Bitterness rages to the finish and well beyond.
Full body, mild carbonation.
I'm wondeirng why this beer is so well regarded. Extreme excess of both hops and coffee, no balance whatsoever. 581 charactersMaltyGoodness, Jun 27, 2008
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4It's always a shame when you feel disappointed by a beer that you supremely enjoy... but alas, that's my experience with Peche Mortel, a fantastic, well-crafted strong coffee stout that compares favorably with Founders... and yet seems nothing at all like a beer worthy of discussion as among the top 25 or 50 beers in the world, let alone number 14 (where it resides at the time of my tasting).
It is, perhaps, the best looking Imperial Stout I've ever seen... not shying away from an assertive carbonation that lifts a few gorgeous fingers of deep creamy head over a pitch black and viscous brew.
The aroma is a pungent lift of coffee with a mocha twist... but it manages to meld a nice roasted malt character that seems like a blessed combination, and not like a cheap trick.
The taste is very good, but not wowing. There's a sharp mineral character that reminds me of cold brewed coffee... and it seems to push itself in front of the malt character and hold off the beer for a moment. It's a character I was intrigued but ultimately put off by in Founders KBS in a similar manner... so I suppose it's something others latch onto and appreciate, but it seems out of touch with the rest of the beer.
Conversely, that same mineral (almost... a freezer burn, or stale refrigerator) flavor imparts an impressive drinkability onto the beer... almost in the same way bitterness does in an IPA. You just want to keep drinking to stay on top of it, and get to the base beer underneath.
As you can see from the score... I still very much enjoyed this... the higher carbonation didn't seem to make the beer spritzy, or unduly heavy or thin.... it aided in the creaminess, to my tastes. But I think they should reign that mineral quality in just a tad. 1,749 characterserrantnight, Jun 26, 2008

Pours an opaque darkness with better than a finger deep foamy dark tan head that fades fairly quickly, leaving spotty patterns of lacing. The smell is amazing deep dark gooey chocolate, roasted malt, a bitter coffee and some of the alcohol in the form of a cherry-vanilla. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is silky smooth, medium bodied. The flavor is big and chocolaty java. The coffee bitterness lingers along with the kiss of vanilla from the 9.5% ABV. Nicely done. A little lighter than i expected. Highly Recommended. 571 charactersjjayjaye, Jun 25, 2008

T&M Very thick rich and cramy. Excellent balance of esspresso and sweet malt. The coffee is not over powering at all. At the swallow the coffee really comes around, with a nutty character as well. At the swallow, a zing of carbonation, a little too much carbonation in my oppinion. The finish is creamy coffee, sweet malt and the fading of sweat into a dry hoppy/ coffee overtone, that lingers for a good amount of time.
Wow, delicious beer. One of the best coffee infused beers I have had. No alcahol warming to be found, which is not a suprise. As this is one full bodied, full flavored beer. I'm glad I still have another bottle. Gonna let this celler for a few years and update the review. 1,119 charactersBuebie, Jun 25, 2008
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A: Black with a thick tan/brown head. Thought about saying -.5 pts for the weird screw top, but the cool label makes up for it.
S: Coffee, roast, licorice and chocolate aromas are excellent.
T: The taste follows the smell. The chocolate seems more noticeable as the brew warms. The finish is bitter.
M: Full and creamy with a carbonation bite.
D: Velvety delicious. This should be a sipping beer, but is so flavorful...I had to use restraint. 446 charactersbarefootbrewer, Jun 24, 2008
4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 411.5 oz bottle, pours a nice dark to opaque color. Has a huge head of tiny fine bubbles. Has a mocha brownish head also
Aroma is pure roasted coffe with hint of sweetness and choclate. I also got some raisin and dark fruits in there.
Body is pretty full to me with some nice carbonation
Taste is rich and silky. Maybe some oatmeal in there for that. After the initial taste as it rolls on the back of the palate you start to get the dark fruits and hops to come through. 
This is a nice coffee stout. Thanks to jonathan for sharing this.

4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from the bottle to a Unibroue Tulip glass. Pour looked like cola - dark brown/black and completely opaque. A finger of head supported by perfect, fine bubbles which formed such a neat order they looked like stacks of pearl necklaces. Smelled like it tastes - fine quality coffee and roasted malts. The hops come out and linger after the initial coffee and roast flavors subside. I can feel the warmth of the etoh only slightly. A little syrupy on the tongue but can still feel the mild carbonation. Has a bit of a bitter bite. Definitely a beer to be sipped - would probably only want to have one due to high alcohol content and fairly big flavor. Delicious. 665 charactersdaftafne, Jun 22, 2008
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.511.5 fl oz bottle into a Meantime snifter (listed at 9.5% ABV).
Pours darker than a moonless night, a pitch black hue with a finger's width of dark tan head that quickly recedes to a thin cap of foam. Thick rings of large bubbles bound to the glass' edge. The aroma is heavenly: rich espresso, a surprising amount of earthy hops, and dark, roasted chocolate malts. 
Tremendous coffee and dark chocolate notes lash at the palate upon the first sip, and continue until the very last. Balancing the onslaught are notes of gooey caramel, dark rum, and raisin. A well-carbonated finish of warming booze and hops round out the velvety-smooth, thick body. Peche Mortel leaves a sweet, bitter coffee aftertaste in its wake, although the body is a touch on the over-carbonated side. All in all, this is a heavenly beer, and well worth the $5.00 price-tag. *kicks hisself for only buying three bottles* 894 characterswagenvolks, Jun 22, 2008
4.72/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 511.5 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, it pours dark brown/black with about an inch brown head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The aroma is great, it smells like roasted malt, coffee/espresso and a bit of chocolate. The taste is similar to the aroma, the roasted coffee/espresso taste is strongest, but bittersweet and milk chocolate are noticable too. There's also a lingering bitter coffee aftertaste. The alcohol is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is medium/full, it's rich and silky with average carbonation. It's also very smooth, which along with the taste makes the drinkability very good. I think this is an excellent beer. I definitely recommend this to others to try, especially if you like coffee. 715 charactersbluejacket74, Jun 22, 2008
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.511.5 oz bottle served slightly chilled into a snifter. Pours dark and opaque with an impressive brown head that disperses some sheets of satiny lace. 
Aroma is somewhat subtle but very inviting. Dark roasted malts evince some coffee bean and bittersweet chocolate notes but the smell of fresh black currants really sets off the nose.
Body is medium full with an ideal soft but prickly carbonation.
Taste is quite rich. Coffee dominates here but with plenty of bittersweet chocolate. Currants show up here too, lending a leasant fruity berry note. Alcohol is well hidden. Seems like there is some oatmeal underneath as this has an incredible smoothness.
Excellent! Certainly one of the better coffee stouts around. 717 charactersmerlin48, Jun 20, 2008

Poured into my Stella Artois chalice. Pours a deep brown, nearly black color. Milk chocolate head that leaves just a little residue along the side of the glass. Smells like roasted coffee beans and tastes like a deep, rich espresso. Some chocolate undertones come out as well. Mouthfeel is silky smooth going down. Overall, I wish I had picked up more than one. This is an outstanding beer. 484 charactersjdubjacket, Jun 19, 2008
4.49/5  rDev +2%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I've had this brew on my Wants List for quite some time but I never really sought it out. Now..thanks to tayner and Yamar18, I get to drink a few bottles.;^) Thanks Dana and Kevin!
I pour this slightly chilled bottle and I get a near pitch black liquid; there's some reddish brown hues in there, especially at the bottom of my glass. The tan head is a good 2 fingers and this puppy is loaded with lacing. Great looking brew!
The smell is a bit on the light side for me. I'm getting some coffee and chocolate and some fruit but I really have to sniff hard for them to register.
The taste, now *that's* another matter entirely. Mmmm, big notes of roasted coffee, providing some bitterness. Nice milk chocolate sweetness that doesn't try to dominate but rather takes some edge off the bitterness. Some toffee, some dark fruit, the latter of which adds just the right touch of tartness and...I'm just starting to notice a bit of smoke.or am I? It sure seems like it. Wow. Medium mouthfeel that's just a hair away from being thick. So drinkable...yeah, where's the 9%abv? lol. Don't tell me!
All this time drinking and the head is still a solid inch in my glass. Is this some fine stuff or what?
Bottom line: This is a world class example of the style and I'm super happy that I got to try it and....I have a few more bottles so I can revisit at my leisure. A must try for anyone that's a fan of the style! 1,406 charactersBitterbill, Jun 18, 2008
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.511.5oz bottle purchased from New Beer Distributors
A_This is how I would like all my stouts to appear. Rich thick and black looking, this delivers. The huge cafe au lait head resmebles the crater ridden surface of the moon as it is dotted with the remnants of big bubbles from down below. As I sit here admiring the beauty, it is taking a long time to recede, from the sides at first leaving an Ayers Rock like appendage from the charred liquid below. The sides of the glass are laced with brown clouds of foam.
S_The aroma that wafts up at me is boozy at first and slightly acidic. This is followed by a megadose of coffee, much like in a Manhattan Espresso Soda. The coffee lingers in the nostrils even as the mug is placed back on the table.
T_The first sip is very good, much like a shot of espresso. This is followed by a bittersweet chocolate richness. The acidity that is shown in the nose lurks ever so slightly in the background here as well. The aftertaste is a mixture of espresso like caffeine and a creamlike sweetness. The alcohol is less ecident in the taste as in the aroma.
M_On the thicker side but not too much. There is actually some restraint here for the style as it does not venture into the chewy category. The carbonation is soft but present enough to push the liquid around the mouth.
D_I am generally somewhat skeptical of the high intensity stouts that are rated so high on BA. To me it almost seems as if anything big gets rated highly and a sort of cult of personality following takes over. As this was my mindset going in, I have to say this delivered the goods. A wonderfully full bodied stout redolent of coffee flavour. At $5.35 a single, it is a bit pricey, but to me well worth it. I am glad a bought a few more. 1,753 characterssleazo, Jun 17, 2008
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This and Founder's Breakfast Stout are the top two coffee/imperial stouts in my opinion. Founder's has a thicker body that lends itself more to winter drinking, while this one is a bit thinner and more suitable for the humid chicago summer day i enjoyed it.
An espresso-crema head quickly dissipated but left a remarkable lacing on my brandy snifter throughout the rather long period of time it took me to finish this. As it warmed the coffee became more evident and the beer continued to shock me in its complexity. 
This is a definite example of perfection in its style. 574 charactersphilberinghele, Jun 16, 2008
4.28/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5a: This was jet-black, no highlights. It poured with a huge, creamy, dark mocha colored head. Decent retention and lots of sticky lace.
s: Surprisingly mild, but enticing nonetheless. This smells like a mocha latte with the addition of some moderate alcoholic warmth.
t: Interesting transitions here. Upfront, this tastes like a mocha latte. Raw, unsweetened cocoa flavors come next before yielding to some strongly bitter, but damn delicious, coffee flavors. The bitter tingle lingers while the gentle warmth of alcohol closes things out.
m: Great body on this one, but the carbonation is more readily seen than felt. Minor flaws seem all the more glaring in such a fantastic brew.
d: Big, big thanks to abankovich for the chance to try this one. Comes in a notch below Founder's Breakfast Stout, but it is still one of the best I've tried. 845 charactersDIM, Jun 14, 2008
4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4200th BA review.
12 ounce bottle with freshness dates notched '0,0' poured into a tulip yields an inky opaque body impervious to even direct sunlight. Not even any highlights that I can see... anyway, it's brown-black with an excellent sticky, creamy mocha head of two fingers with excellent retention that leaves sheets and rings of sticky lacing despite the substantial ABV.
Smell is rich dark-roasted espresso with a silky tinge of dark chocolate that persists despite all the smoky, winey, burnt, roasty coffee notes.
Flavors? Well, well. No surprises here, except how well the potent alcohol is hidden. Black French Roast coffee with a twang of Columbian coffee-light, plus an oily Italian espresso note with a hint of Seattle mocha make no quibble about what flavor is in charge of this beer. Bittersweet chocolate raises its head, no doubt, but is bitchslapped into stunned silence by a bold roasty note of Arabica. Caramel peeps out, probably looking for help, or maybe trying to escape, but is stomped flat by a big black rip of Kenya AA.
Smooth, rich, and full-bodied... I'm a coffee lover, a stout lover, and a big fan of beer for breakfast. This is the one for me. If only I could get my Braun to dispense this in the morning instead of Maxwell House... well, Hell, I'd never leave home!
Beer. It's not just for breakfast any more. 1,348 characterscvstrickland, Jun 14, 2008
4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Decided to crack one of these newly aquired bottles to start off the weekend.
Poured into a snifter, jet black with an attractive medium pillowy brown head, and chunky lacing. Smell is strong espresso, touches of chocolate, and thought I even picked up some banana in there for a minute. Taste is very much espresso, and dark chocolate, backed by a little bit of a alcohol burn in the throat. Mouthfeel is slick and not too heavy, espresso lingers. Drinkability is nice, but I'll savour this one for a while, or atleast I'll try.
Reminds me of Founders BS. 558 charactersamiles, Jun 14, 2008
4.65/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5thanks to ph2001 for this in a trade!
A- poured a thick black oil that looks pretty delicious, and a milk chocolate head on top that built up huge and left huge lacing and solid retention as well. pretty damn solid
S- actually a slightly sweet scent to it which surprized me, strong malty characteristics that are nice, actually reminds me of a milk stout, however it is very tastey smelling, the coffee scents are kept to a minimum actually, much lighter than i was expecting.
T- huge black roasted characteristics, the maltyness and roasted characteristics are really nice, an expresso flavor is present, and the slight lactose flavor is present as well. as the beer moves on in the mouth the coffee flavors really come out giving a great smoothness and roundedness to the beer. the coffee lingers forever which is really nice and gives a great all around characteristic. i love the way the slight sweetness and coffee work together
m- thick low carbonation, and again the coffee lingers forever
D- awesome sipper, thanks for the trade 1,042 charactersAtron67, Jun 14, 2008

4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A: Poured into a goblet a very black pour with thick tan head. No light is going to be piercing through this. Good amount of lacing left along the side of the glass.
S: Very strong smell of coffee, oatmeal, molasses, hints of chocolate. You don't have to get your nose very close to catch the smell of this beer, it emanates out of the glass very easily.
T: The coffee taste is strong in the beginning and dissipates into the maltier stout side afterwards. The taste is very full and complex. An aftertaste of chocolate, malts, and an almost brown sugar linger. This is a very smooth taste considering the look and smell of this beer, not too overpowering.
F: Full bodied beer to be sure. Some alcohol feel, but nothing that would deter from the experience.
D: A great beer to have on a cool or cold night. Wouldn't want this anywhere else. Very rich and complex, one of these is enough for me in a night. But a wonderful beer and great representation of a stout both in look and taste. 990 charactersScrumtralecent, Jun 12, 2008
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Dark and black with a thick tan head. Bubbles are small and dense giving it a creamy texture. 
Coffee, cola, prune, dark chocolate, grain of paradise, and some carbon aromas. Slight molasses smell in there too. 
Starts with some sweet chocolate flavors, almost like a chocolate chip cookie. The coffee then hits you in the mouth. Beautiful and complex coffee flavors too, not just roasted/acrid flavors. Fruity plum like flavor towards the end. The finish is roasty and bitter. Beautiful flavor profile. 
Mouthfeel hits a nice balance with me. This is definitely one of the finer examples of an Imperial Stout. Balance is what makes this beer great. Highly recommended. 672 charactersbosco7, Jun 12, 2008

"Imperial Coffe Stout Brewed With Real, Fair-Trade Coffee" on the artistic front logo sticker...
Beautiful appearance... pours a midnight, jet-black, ebony hue with a gigantic foamy, and reddish-tan head that lingered on for a while before slowly receding and leaving behind a copious amount of lacing around the edge of ther serving glass...
Intense aroma replete with fresh, roasted coffee beans, dark-chocolate, super-sweet malts, and a hint of alcohol...
Taste was immense, thick, rich, and strong, literally bursting with rich, creamy, dark-chocolate... Certainly up there with some of the best Imperial Stouts I've tried, including Great Divide's Yeti... Taste was super-sweet, loaded with dark molasses, honey, candied sugars, rich, roasted malts, tons of coffee beans, latte, rich mocha, and dark espresso...
Creamy, super-thick and rich mouthfeel, and the alcohol was also very well-hidden...
Drinkability wasn't bad for a beer this intense, full-bodied and strong...
Excellent stuff...

4.65/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle received from Viggo at Dark Lord Day. Thanks a bunch! Bottled in November 2007. Poured into my Duvel tulip
A: Pitch black with a dense dark brown head. Dark ruby highlights. Excellent retention. Surprisingly, this one leaves some lacework too!
S: Coffee, heavily roasted espresso up front with cream, bitter chocolate, and a little bit of dark fruit sweetness - figs, raisins and grapes. Definitely a coffee assault but very well balanced
T: A quandary of a coffee assault with the force of a juggernaut and the delicacy of a ballet dancer. Neither as strong nor as heavily roasted as the nose might suggest. Starts off with a strong coffee note and then takes on a complex malt profile with roast, creamy sweetness and almost some nuts. Delicious, probably my favorite coffee stout.
M: A tad overcarbonated but the long, bitter finish is excellent.
D: It's 90 degrees and i'm enjoying this more that i should. Lives up to the hype
**Edit 13 June 2012**
I'm drinking my last bottle of this beer. I received this from Viggo, making this 4.5 years old.
The coffee is still surprisingly potent, making me wonder what this was like fresh (I haven't had it in a while). A touch ashy/tarry, but in a way that I welcome and thoroughly enjoy. The palate has some creamy dark chocolate, a moderate coffee presence, if a little stale, a mild acidity, a nice roasty malt character. Bitter finish with stale coffee, a touch of char and soft carbonation. Still quite nice. 4.5/4/4/4.5/4
**Edit 28 Jan 2013**
This bottle I picked up at Healthy Spirits back in May 2008. The slow purging of the cellar continues...
Still solid, can't add much to my notes above. 1,667 charactersDefenCorps, Jun 10, 2008

Dark, black liquid poured from the 12 oz bottle, and left a frothy, creamy, mocha head that lasted. In the nose, I got freshly brewed black coffee, rich dark chocolate, some vanilla, with a touch of wood smoke and hops. The flavour profile was quite enjoyable to me, as I love coffee. Fresh dark roast with loads of bittering hops, vanilla, dry, bitter dark chocolate, some smoke. Bitter with long lived coffee aftertaste. Creamy, and very drinkable considering the ABV. Quite a treat. Thank you Harry! :) 538 charactersmrmanning, Jun 09, 2008

Black light proof beer with a tall glass filling brown head.
Strong chocolate aroma and just as strong coffee. Extremely strong coffee aroma as strong or stronger as Founders Breakfast Stout. Kahlúa and coconut round out the aroma.
The taste starts out sweet and bitter like coffee liqueur one of the less sweet ones. Long lasting coffee aftertaste here and it is quite nice. Vanilla flavor possibly from charred white oak. Very much a coffee beer, anything else here is just a nuance.
Mouthfeel is good.
Great sipping beer here, not to rich and not too weak. Completely a coffee beer and if you don't like coffee you won't like this. 689 charactersZorro, Jun 07, 2008
4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Wow, so psyched to have had a chance to try this.
Poured from a 11.5 oz bottle into a pint glass.
Appearance was as of any Imperial worth its merit, pitch black with a frothy tan head with great lacing and retention. No light gets through this whatsoever.
Smell was of roasty bakers chocolate and espresso. Think Old Rasputin with a double espresso shot poured into it.
Taste was consistent with the smell, amazing blend of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla bean. Every sip, it gets better.
Mouthfeel was great, a tad on the high end carbonation wise but still drinks incredibly smooth. 
I would give the drinkability a 5 but the 9.5 abv limits that for sure, as does the intensity of the flavor. This is definitely one to sip and enjoy after dinner or as a night cap, not at all something you'd want to quaff to get drunk off of. 
Overall an amazing beer and i'm happy I got a chance to try it given that I found it by accident at the local shop. Seek out and enjoy! 971 charactersBejogle, Jun 07, 2008

4.41/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Gets a 5 from me because I love it when a huge stout has great head and head retention. noce and black with a fluffy two finger oatmeal colored head that slowy fades down to 1 finger.
S: Lots of coffee, gorounds infact,with some milky sweetness. Roasted malt with some vanilla. Slightest amount of cherry, but not as pungent overall as I expected.
T: Well it's super smooth, as an oatmeal stout should be. Great mouthfeel, though a tad bit heavier would have been perfect.Coffee and dark chocolate dominates the flavor giving way to vanilla, some oakiness comes in and overtakes the flavor, moving in to a smokey flavor. Hops push through in the end delivering some spice, and the long finish is all hop biterness and some slight alochol sting at the very end. I was surpised by the amount of hops coming through at the end, but this is pretty fresh, and probably mellows over time.
Ovr: This is an extremly good beer. I found myself comparing this to Devil Over a Barrell becuase I had it recently. This beer has mucuh more of a hop spice to me, and is a bit fuller tasting, though Devil is technically a porter. Overall fantastic. 1,138 charactersejquin, Jun 06, 2008

This is simply a tremendous beer that lives up to its following. Appearance is deep brown with a dark head. The head retention is amazing, even after just 2 oz. sits for ten minutes. Yes, I'm savoring this one.
Aroma is sweet grounds and berries. Slight alcohol edge. Nummy.
Tastes rich and full. No bourbon type fusil or butteriness. Complex and seamless integration between the bean and grain. body is perfect. This is a beer that I would spend the night slowly drinking two of these. I was fortunate to have this on draft also, along with several other beers from this brewery and Hopfenstark (maybe the best saison I've ever had) at Spuyten Duyvil. Sorry, i had to brag a little. What a night! 797 charactersbarrelman, Jun 05, 2008
4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours out an opaque black darkness with two fingers of tan suds. Probably just a tad too warm.
Smell was coffee and sugary toasted malts with lots of sugary caramel to mellow out the hoppiness that lays in the back there.
Taste is superb like Ten Fidy or malty like a Blackout stout. Very drinkable.
Mouthfeel is very dry as one would expect but some oils were left behind on the tounge to even things out.
Hard to come by but when and if I could have a lot of these, I would drink four or five right in a row. 510 characterspeabody, Jun 05, 2008
4.89/5  rDev +11.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5660ml bottle from April 2005
Having just tried one of the new batch last week at Monk's Cafe, I thought it was time to crack open the old man in the cellar. Thanks to BuckeyeNation for the bottle, many moons ago.
A - A bubbly tan head quickly dissipates leaving a wisp of color on a dark brown background, much like a cup of black coffee with suagr residue on the surface. Very little lacing.
S - Smell is of a Paris cafe - espresso and tobacco.
T - Very well balanced flavors. Coffee bitterness dominates but the acidity is just right to keep the bitterness in check.
M - Very light carbonation on this bottle complements the flavors well. Texture is not creamy, but not watery either. Overall, a good platform.
D - Very high drinkability on this one, especially for coffee fans. Alcohol is not present at all. Could easily pass for a 5% beer, except for the obvious symptoms of intoxication as I near the end of the bottle. 931 charactersscthaden, Jun 05, 2008
4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Got this from my folks in celebration of getting a new job. Awesome gift - thanks Mom and Dad.
Poured a 12oz. bottle into a snifter.
Appearance - It pours an opaque black - like motor oil - no light penetrates. It produced a 1 1/2 finger tannish, frothy, creamy, latte foam head. The head slowly dissipating to a thin crown - and the crown never leaves. A quick swirl of the glass brings the head right back - this brew has great head retention. The head leaves behind a light lacing. Overall, this beer looks really good. 
Smell - This brew smells delicious. One of the best smelling coffee stouts I have come across. It has a huge espresso component - huge, but not artificial like many other coffee stouts I have tried. There is a hint of creaminess in the scent - perhaps a hint of lactose, but I could be wrong. There is a strong cocoa powder presence at the end of the scent. The scent is pretty bitter overall - a near perfect mix of coffee grounds dark chocolate. 
Taste - This is one of the best mixes of coffee and chocolate I have ever had in a beer. The espresso huge and unartificial. There is a delicious bitter cocoa powder and dark chocolate finish. The flavor has a creamy transition between the coffee and cocoa. But perhaps what I love most is that the ABV is completely hidden - I can't detect any alcohol in the flavor at all. An awesome feat of brewing prowess. I don't know who the brewmaster of Dieu Du Ciel is, but he should be proud of himself.
Mouthfeel - Moderate carbonation level. It is incredibly smooth and creamy as it washes over the tongue. Medium to full bodied. There is something slightly astringent in the mouthfeel, assumingly from the coffee. My only complaint is that I would have wanted some finer textured carbonation to liven up the beer a little.
Drinkability - The smoothness of the mouthfeel makes this brew extremely drinkable - it is so easy to quaff. The smell is incredibly alluring. Taste is over the top - one of the best coffee stouts I have ever had. The ABV is completely undetectable. Simply an awesome beer. 2,072 charactersMiguelMandingo, Jun 05, 2008
4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Drank this one to celebrate passing my 1st kyu test in Aikido. Served in my DFH snifter. Poured an opaque black with a half-inch, tight, tan-colored head consisting of copious tiny bubbles. Dissipated into a fairly consistent cap within minutes. Sheets of lace; some legs, but somewhat spotty. Scent of roasted coffee dominates the nose on a malt background with just the slightest suggestion of sweetness. Taste consistent with nose with the roasted flavor more pronounced without being burnt; just the slightest suggestion of hops expressed at the finish. Mouhfeel is not quite medium-bodied with quite of bit of effervescence across the tongue, revealed as a slight burn. Faintest hint of alcohol and hops bitterness lingers at the finish between quaffs. Good drinkability, but not readily available in my area. Definitely need to make the trip to Montreal to sample more offerings from Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel 912 charactersJwale73, Jun 05, 2008

incredibly smooth and velvety, an amzing texture to it, medium body. slightly creamy with a good carbonation at the front of the mouth. the coffee flavors are very strong and do not let up on the aftertaste. sweet, roasty full flavors are there too. 483 charactersph2001, Jun 04, 2008

It poured a deep black color with almost no head. I was looking forward to the coffee aspect of it, and I didn't note very much coffee on the nose, but when I started to drink it, and especially as it warmed the roasted coffee really started to come through. Although I was sharing the bottle after dinner and some other drinks, I found it highly drinkable and will look forward to enjoying it again soon. 484 charactersdill, Jun 04, 2008
4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a darkness with a tan head... looks very stouty!
It smells like you would expect a coffee stout to... notes of espresso and roastiness. 
I get cocoa in the mouth... more roastiness, very strong when it's cold. As it warms, it subdues to a nice, even experience.
It's very smooth and very creamy. I can taste the alcohol but at close to 10%, it hides most of it.
This beer is outstanding and well worth the $5.50 I paid for the 12oz bottle. For the next bottle, I will let it sit out for 30 or so minutes before popping the cap. The taste as it warms is as good as any stout I've had. 593 charactersrudylaw, Jun 04, 2008

Once again, big THANKS to Pimpp (Patrick) for this 1! He hooks me up with some of the best beers out there!
A- Thick black with an enormous tan head. Thick chunky lacing down the glass.
S- Pungent dark chocolate with dark roasted coffee beans.
T- Strong bitter dark chocolate up front with a big dose of strong espresso. Hints of vanilla cream are apparent throughout the body. 
M- Strong and bitter aty first but morphing into a thick, sweet, and creamy dessert! Slight touch of alc in the aftertaste.

Vibrant coffee notes with huge malt and grassy hops - a little BBQ char and some residual sweetness of cinnamon sugar.
Very well-blended roasted malt with strong coffee component. Alcohol is present but lifts overall flavor profile nicely. Very strong bitter coffee with grassy hops - similar to nose. Nice stuff.
Velvety, coaty, warming stuff. Coffee strong on finish. Excellent.
Nicely drinkable for style - still a sipper. 535 charactersIBUnit63, Jun 03, 2008
3.93/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.511.5 oz bottle with no dates. 
Glugged out of the bottle oil black with a huge 4 finger dense, foamy tan head that took a long time to dissipate, and when it finely subsided enough for me to drink it the glass was covered in sticky lacing. 
Smells like a cup of morning coffee you can stand a spoon in.. camping coffee, the kind that still have the grounds in the bottom of the pot, cooked over an open fire. I half expected after smelling it to have coffee grounds floating in it. 
Taste is coffee, very strong coffee. It is like I poured myself a cup of coffee and then let it get cold sitting on the counter. If you can get your tongue, nose and brain past the coffee there are also some bitter chocolate tones as well. There is a sweetness for just a minute but it quickly gets over-run by bitterness that remains long after swallowing. 
This is thick, chewy, and surprisingly creamy. Very viscous. I could have used something in the way of hops to remove some of the oil from my palate, but overall reasonably good for a RIS. 
This is a once in a while beer IMO. A nightcap, or morning pick me up, but definitely not a session beer. Not a beer for the meek. not a beer for those who dont love coffee. IMO, slighty overhyped but still very good. 1,254 characterstayner, Jun 03, 2008
4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Pours nigh-completely black - just a touch of brown visible underneath the dark tan head. The scent that wafts up consists of coffee grounds, cocoa, faint cinnamon, and black bread. Taking a sip, the inital flavors are surprisingly understated and sweetly matly. Nothing too bold, for a second or so. A roasty base opens up for the topliner - and coffee makes a big entrance, taking the floor the way the bourbon flavors in Bourbon County do. Really dominant, like biting into an espresso bean, but balanced sufficiently, though by no means completely, by some dark fruit and cocoa touches. The bitter coffee aftertaste is just a touch astringent and takes on some similarity to cola on the back of the tongue and back teeth, which gets in the way, especially at warmer temps. In spite of this, the mouthfeel is close to perfect - rich, creamy and coating, but doesn't linger longer than welcome. Overall, this is a great entry in the style. I'll be sipping the remaining while watching Lord Stanley's Cup being handed around this eve - fittingly a Canadian beer for the national sport.
Edit - My S.O. was cooking wings while I was drinking this and the smell of the chicken mingling with the flavor of the coffee made it start to taste like bacon. Which is awesome, IMO, though not entirely apropos of the beer review... digression apologies. 1,344 charactersgrandq, Jun 03, 2008
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured a beautiful pitch black with a nice one inch head. Smells heavily of coffee with some chocolate undertones. Each sip begins with a nice sweet coffee and finishes with the bitterness of a black coffee. The mouthfeel is medium with a nice creamy finish. I think I could have a couple of these at a time, a nice treat, but not something you could have continuously. Really glad I have a few more of these in the cellar for some aging. 438 charactersCedromar, Jun 02, 2008
4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I purchased this on a whim from Sam's Quik Stop in Durham. (Darn those close-to-register impulse stacks!) Something about the name of the brew called out to me, so I bought one of these 11.5oz bottles to sample; I'm glad I did.
It pours an outrageously pitch black, with a dark tan head just chock full of tiny bubbles. Honestly, this has to be one of the densely packed heads I've seen on a beer. The two-finger head began to dissipate within a few minutes, and soon it became a thin lacing that clung to the rim and spread about halfway across the surface.
Coffee dominates the aroma. Although other smells are certainly there (dark roasted malts, dark unsweetened cocoa, and alcohol), it's the coffee that hits the nose hard and barely lets go. It probably goes without saying the flavor is also controlled by coffee. There is an element of dark, ripe fruit in the center and a nice balance of hop bitterness at the finish. Dark roasted malts are noticeable; this contributes a nice smokey character to the entire tasting experience.
It is bit creamy, with a medium to full body and just a little too much carbonation (for my taste, anyway). This is certainly a most enjoyable coffee stout; I'm glad I spent the money and time getting to know it. 1,252 charactersCWiggins, Jun 02, 2008

The beer poured a deep, deep black hole color, opaque. There was a thick 1 inch head, deep brown. The head receeded quickly. The aroma was strong coffee and chocolate that was pleasing, not overpowering. The taste had a pleasant and strong roasted malt character but was also a bit sweet to balance things out well. There was also a nice peppery note on my tongue that was interesting. A full bodied beer and definitely worth getting your hands on. 607 charactersggaughan, May 31, 2008

Black. Stiff dense head, dark beige/ light tan, starts at an inch and slowly melts into a thin layer, painting the glass with very finely textured beige lace. Sediment at the bottom of the bottle.
Coffee dominates the aroma. Rich sweet dark coffee with some fresh fruitiness.
Tastes like coffee, very tasty coffee. Mild sweetness, moderate fruity acidity, good roasted coffeelike bitterness. The coffee taste grows more and more rich and full for several seconds, then lingers for a long time. Well balanced (in a sense), delicious coffee flavor.
Smooth creamy carbonation. Fairly full texture, with some thickness, and some fine astringent powderiness. Plenty drinkable, for a coffee lover. 754 charactersBeerzebub, May 30, 2008

S - Roasted coffee, caramel malts, with a citric tinge. I suspect this will be a hoppy stout.
T - Coffee, coffee, and more coffee. Pleasant, but the malt is completely overpowered. The stout is indeed a bit hoppy.
M - Thin to medium bodied, dry finish.
D - I was expecting a whole lot of coffee and that's what I got. If this is what you are into, you will enjoy this beer. 481 characterssessycuban, May 29, 2008

3.98/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 412 oz bottle poured into a snifter, two tastings: the first was served just under 50 degrees, the second was pushing 60 degrees.
A: Pours pitch black, but with very fluid movement (no detectable slowing of the pour due to thickness.) Tan foamy head foams up to over a quarter inch, but dissipates quickly. Leaves a very light, but still noticeably present lacing.
S: coffee, dark chocolate, and roasted malt.
T: The coffee, of course, takes the main stage with the bitterness of dark chocolate becoming increasingly present as it warms. I detect a slight hint of the raisin/prune maltiness found in doublebocks. Although the coffee is dominant, I feel as though they really took their time creating this beer. It is far less offensive than some other coffee-bombs I have sampled. It's balanced - not by hops, as they are basically non-existent - but it still maintains its civility.
M: Creamy and smooth, lingering on the tongue for quite some time.
D: If drank slowly and methodically, I would say its drinkability is higher than most 9% extreme stouts. That's not to say I could come in from mowing the grass in August and pour a pint of this to quench my thirst.
An extremely well-crafted brew that should find itself on the 'at least once' list of most enthusiasts. 1,271 charactersguzzle211, May 26, 2008

Big roasty aroma. Lots of coffee, cream, and a bit of dark chocolate. Some dark fruits near the end. 
Loads of roasty flavor. Dark fruit and coffee seem to dominate. There is some bitterness from the roasty flavors, but not overkill. Bittersweet chocolate comes to mind after a while. 
A bit thin in the mouth. Alcohol is very well hidden. A bit more vinous as it warms. Pretty nice. 537 charactersBierguy5, May 24, 2008

I wish my coffee tasted more like this. It appeared pitch black, of course, with a tan head and lacing. The aroma and flavor are both a little heavy on the phenols, too much clove, but aside from that being out of whack, this was a wonderful coffee-infused beer. The java took centerstage and really ran the show, the beer provided all the background of black roasted grains and a hits of dry cocoa. I do think this beer is a bit over-rated. I didn't get the sort of flawless complexity I get out of the other top beers. Still, this is worth trying once despite the high price tag. 613 characterstempest, May 24, 2008

341 mL (crazy Canadians) bottle allowed to warm up a bit before pouring it into a snifter. 11 and 07 notched on the side.
Pours an onyx black with a bold one finger dark brown head that slowly falls to a thin layer of bubbles. A fair amount of lacing is left on the sides of the glass. Smell is big on bitter coffee grinds, super dark chocolate, and some charred wood. Underneath all that is hint of booze and molasses with a touch of espresso. There's a tiny bit of lactose in the nose as well that fits in perfectly. I have a feeling this is about to get even better. Taste begins with smokey coffee and sweet caramel malt with a booze-like sting. More chocolate, more espresso, and some dark fruits as well. Aftertaste is sweet syrupy molasses with a slight alcohol burn. Just a big bold coffee beer with lots of underlying complex flavors. Mostly a smooth and creamy full feel with a slight tingle from the carbonation. Just an amazing beer experience, especially if you're a coffee drinker. Definitely a must try. 1,060 charactersBeerTruth, May 22, 2008
4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Received in trade with Abankovich Thank you Adam! 
Péché Mortel pours an opaque black color with a tan colored head that left decent lacing for a stout. Loads and loads of coffee sometimes leaning towards espresso in the nose with cocoa and bitter chocolate mingling in the nose as well. The flavor profile blends those same flavors together with perfection. I am not usually much of a coffee stout fan, but the coffee/espresso flavor only co-mingles with the chocolate and roasted grain and never dominates. The coffee flavor is just done so very well. I also get secondary flavors of caramel and a slight bitter hop flavor. Coupled with the flavor the mouthfeel for a beer with this high ABV is well done. This beer is very smooth and creamy with only slight carbonation. I liked the drinkability on this beer, but one is about enough for me at time.
I had this beer around 7 p.m. last night and I didn't really think about the caffeine, but I was wide away for the next several hours. I am going to say this is the best use of coffee I've had in a beer.
Thank you for the trade again Adam. 1,097 charactersTheodorHerzl, May 21, 2008
4.03/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Into my Corsendonk glass goes the "Mortal Sin"! Pours a gorgeous black with a tall tan head that fills half the tulip and slowly reduces to a spotty covering of the dense dark beer. The lacing is pronounced and generous.
If you like coffee, you're halfway through the smell already. Lush roasty notes and a good chunk of milky chocolate comprise most of the nose, there's something here that reminds me of hot chocolate made with whole milk (just like mom used to make!) along with a little hash bitterness to go with the alcohol sting. A bit one-dimensional, but enjoyable nonetheless.
The taste is where this really shines; let it warm and you'll be well rewarded. Deep and rich coffee mocha bitterness blends with sweet smooth malts and milk chocolate to create a full, chewy, heavy beer that goes down easy in spite of itself. The roasted coffee bean flavor lingers on the palate and the only downside is a hint of unwelcome astringency. The hops are restrained, but present, and add another layer of complexity to the bitterness on display here. Leaves me with a feeling like I've just chowed down on a handful of chocolate espresso beans...
Mouthfeel is thick and well carbonated, smooth and full. Goes down pretty easy, especially as it warms. Finishes bittersweet and long, and makes your breath smell like coffee. You could fool your girl in a pinch if you stumbled home with this on your breath.
This is pretty good drinking, but just how much 9% coffee beer can one down, anyway? I'm nearing the end of my ounce bottle and am fairly satisfied...
Peche Mortel is a fine coffee stout, but I question its position on the "best of BA" list... it's certainly not in my top 25 brews. But it's tasty and hard to find fault with. I don't often crave coffee stouts, but if this hits my state, at $5 a bottle the price is right for such a delightful, well-made brew. Recommended, just don't commit any grievous sin to get it. 1,931 characterskkipple, May 21, 2008
4.27/5  rDev -3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Big thanks to my man grub for sending me two bottles of this beer. I've been waiting so long to try this one and decided to have it tonight for my 250th review!
Pours a nice onyx color with a HUGE head, more than half of my glass filled with some chocolate hue foam. Some thick soapy lacing as the head settles. Nice looking but it takes a bit too long to settle down.
Loads of coffee right up the bat with a mixture of vanilla, roasted malts, bitter chocolate, charred and roasted barley. The coffee presence is both aggressive but a soft, delicate, roast that combines well with the malts. As the foam settles (and it sure takes its time) I begin to pick up some toasted bread, cocoa, condensed milk, milk chocolate and malted milk. There's also some earthiness that might be from the hops. Truly a very good aroma for an imperial coffee stout; it has a strong coffee presence but there is also enough malts to remind you that you are drinking a beer. Towards the end I pick up aromas of chocolate chip cookies.
Just as in the aroma, strong coffee flavor on the first sip with a hefty dose of toasted and chocolate malts. Bitter chocolate comes in near the finish and there's also just a hint of alcohol that comes by as a fruity flavor. After drinking about half of the beer the coffee and bitter chocolate are more allies than enemies, they compliment each other very well and the toasted flavor and fruitiness in the finish is damn tasty.
Mouth-feel is good for the style, well carbonated and just a tad syrupy and sticky sweet. There is a bit of bitterness and dryness in the finish.
A really good beer overall, definitely one to seek after if you enjoy coffee stouts. 1,679 charactersseaoflament, May 20, 2008
4.26/5  rDev -3.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appears a pitch black hue absolutely no light shines through when held up to the light, although it does form a large tan moccha frothing head rising at least an inch above my Gulden Draak chalice. Aroma is full of dark chocolate black patent malt cocoa powder kind of scent with a strong smell of fresh roasted coffee. Some mild herbaceous hop notes follow but mainly I'm getting dark bitter chocolate and dark roasted coffee. Flavors break through with strong filtered coffee blended with whipped cream, truly a another great breakfast beer. Strong dark bitter chocolate flavor but tastes like coffee note much like a Bell's Java Stout or Founder's Breakfast Stout. That flavor comes off a bit one dimensional but it's okay with me I'm enjoying it, not much alcohol burn very well hidden. Not much noticeable hop notes either, but the dark chocolate and coffee bitterness reign supreme. Mouthfeel is full bodied soft even carbonation quite silky on the palate. Drinkability is challenging due to the complexity and rich chocolate and robust coffee flavors, not much alcohol noticeable but I guess that's the part that could get you. Definitely a beer that will make you crave it, I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it right here down the street from my house in Steubenville Ohio at Valley Wine Cellar. 1,307 charactersWVbeergeek, May 20, 2008
4.26/5  rDev -3.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 412 oz. bottle poured into my .4 L Deschutes Brewers Reserve Series snifter, Péché Mortel is pitch black, with a thick, burnt tan head that is super dense and long lasting, leaving glorious lace and rocky foam. 
Smell is huge, boozy chocolate malt and espresso, a bit of chalky lactose (which I honestly don't care for, e.g. milk stouts) that becomes more rubbery phenols as it warms. 
Taste is even more purely coffee, wow, very nice and full, with a big chocolaty finish. Majorly tasty desert beer, but with a pleasant astringency that would balance any sweets. 
Mouthfeel is thick, tempered by crisp, creamy carbonation, particularly when colder. 
Drinkability is good, a tasty, very full flavored beer then most big stout fans will really enjoy, and whose heavy load is well carried. However, I don't think I'd want more then one, and I can see how some would criticize it for depending to much on the adjuncts. Something about the strength of the chocolate and coffee, combined with the phenolic nose, however, seem a bit homebrewish. 1,043 charactersccrida, May 19, 2008

This one just glugs out of the bottle and quickly forms a creamed coffee colored head. Its very dark, not a bit of light can get through this one. Great lacing as I drink it. 
This smells predominantly of complex coffee and dark chocolate with some roasted malts as well. I say complex coffee because half the time it smelled like fresh roasted espresso the other half it was more like ground coffee beans before making coffee ( a more earthy coffee smell).
Originally when its still a bit cold its kind of astringent on the coffee taste. I'm going to let it warm quite a bit now. As the guy said in the review before me this one is best warm. Man the taste just opens up. The coffee taste is now just really smooth and clean and is the dominant flavor. I thought KBS was coffee forward but this one takes coffee to a whole new level.
The mouthfeel is nice and viscous but its a little fizzy and slightly over carbonated for an RIS in my opinion.
Drinkability is kind of medium when cold but its nice once warmed. You can get a hint of the alcohol but its hidden pretty well. Can't have more than one or two of these bad boys. 1,298 charactersthickerfreakness, May 19, 2008

A: Pours pitch black with a dense one-finger head that lingers a bit and leaves a fantastic network of lacing along the side. Slightest bit of mahogany around the edges when held up to the light.
S: Smell is dominated by dark roasted coffee with sweet cream and chocolate and roasted malts present as well.
T: Big bitter espresso taste up front with a nice sweet chocolate and malt taste to balance the astringency. The coffee taste lingers for ages after each sip with alcohol making itself present throughout.
M: Mouthfeel is super creamy but nice and crisp in the finish due to the coffee astringency. Carbonation leaves a nice tingle on the tongue.
D: This is one hell of a coffee stout and I would certainly put it on my short list for best impy stouts. The coffee flavor comes across a bit astringent but I'm nitpicking. 885 charactersgford217, May 17, 2008

4.6/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Nick at Liquormax for finally getting this stuff in Colorado. Enjoyed at cellar temp in a large snifter glass. 
Near black color with some rich brown hues and a creamy dark tan head. 
The nose has a big bouquet of espresso up front. This is followed by dark roasted malts, chocolate, molasses and some complex fruity alcohols.
The flavor profile also begins with a big helping of freshly roasted coffee that is well blended with some light hops and a sweet malt structure. Chololate, toffee and rum drenched fruit.
The body silks over the palate with an active carbonation. A delicious stout. Well balanced considering the amount of coffee involved. 663 charactersrye726, May 16, 2008
4.36/5  rDev -0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I got a few of these from various places, but tonight during a routine stop into the Candlewyck in Buckingham, I spot a whole stash of these bad boys for $7 apiece.
APPEARANCE: Pours into my Delirium tulip a pitch black with a one and a half finger high, loose-bubbled, light brown head. This is one of the biggest heads I've ever seen on an imperial stout. It has nice staying power too and leaves wall of lacing down the glass. Can I give this a 5.5? Or 8.0?
SMELL: WHOA COFFEE! This is, without a doubt, the strongest coffee aroma I've ever smelled in a beer. It actually kind of masks all the other flavors going on, but it goes without saying that there's a strong roasty component. Other than that, it's light on the chocolate and just about non-existent on the hops.
TASTE: And this is, without a doubt, the strongest coffee FLAVOR I've ever TASTED in a beer. Tremendously roasty, but with a more well-rounded profile than the nose. A strong caramel component goes with the coffee nicely, as does a decently strong hop bitterness on the back end.
MOUTHFEEL: My brain doesn't know how this is possible, but my tongue says this feels weirdly thinner than it should. It's still milkshake smooth though with a nice, low carbonation.
DRINKABILITY: You know that 9% ABV? Yeah, me neither, because you can't taste it at all. I need to stop myself from drinking this too fast.
I need some eggs and toast after this. What a treat! If you're a coffee person, get this beer immediately! If you're not a coffee person, well... get this beer immediately! 1,554 charactersjmalex, May 15, 2008

Poured from 12oz bottle in Fin Du Monde Challace. Emptying bottle into glass results in 1.5 finger coco/kahaki head. This stout is so dark that it might have sucked the light from the room. Bouquet is of Burnt coffee and unsweetened chocolate. Taste initially of coffee, no surprise here, bitter chocolate, and more burnt coffee. Slightly bitter. Moderate drinkability, due in part to high abv I don't think that I could put back more then 2 of these in a sitting. Alcohol is completely masked by complex mesh of flavors. Slightly dry finish. Mouth feel is perfect, not cloying like other stouts of this variety. lingering taste of coffee. Highly recommended. 702 charactersKraken, May 14, 2008

I have not altered the text of my review, but I have decreased some of the scores from 5's to 4+. It was one of my first reviews. What I say is true, but I could say much more now. it's a truly special beer, which is why I haven't seen it in years. Good to meet again, Mortel Sin!
thick tan head with modest retention and some lacing. Deep, dark black. Beautiful. 
Assertive but not obnoxious aroma of smooth coffee, and a very faint hint of alcohol.
bitter chocolate and coffe dominate but with roasted malt and a sweet maltiness sneaking in to add smoothness and balance. Delicious.
pretty full, slick and oily. Slides down easily. This could be a dangerous beer at 9.5% and drinking this easily. 803 characterssprucetip, May 13, 2008
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Massive tan head, looks like it's gonna be a while for it to go down. Body is a pitch black. For 9% the lacing is intense.
Smell: An odor that just flys from the glass, loaded with chocolate, any earthy aroma, and... oh yeah, COFFEE. The smell is very pungant. The coffee is deep roasted which compliments the bitter chocolate well.
Taste: Strong. In terms of complexity, there isn't a whole lot. The few flavors that hit your tongue, however, really lay a smack down. What surprised me the most was the coffee, and not as much coffee as what I expected. Thats not to say its not there, oh its there. A bittersweet chocolate rounded out with dark somewhat tart fruit. The coffee sits in the background, filling the mouth at various spots. 
Mouthfeel: Carbonation level is low, a very slick stout which compliments the lasting taste very well.
Drinkability: At 9% the alcohol doesn't overwhelm you, but it'll creep up on you. A very intense flavour, maybe 2 of these, if I could find another one. 1,011 charactersjslot38, May 13, 2008
4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Thanks markgugs for this one.
Small capped bottle poured into a snifter. Bottled 10/07.
It is pitch black, with a voluminous tan head, quite fluffy and extensive, as big as I have seen for high ABV beers. It slowly drops down to a collar that lasts forever, leaving a lot of sticky, extensive lacing on the sides of the glass. It cannot look better than this. 
Aroma is, as expected, coffee and more coffee. There is, however, some roasted malts and chocolate under, and not being a coffee drinker myself I cannot really express it very well, but this coffee just smeels better than others; perhaps it is a bit more delicate, not overpowering yet still easy to smell. 
Medium to full bodied, perhaps its only significant flaw is lacking a bit more body; taste is just as the aroma suggested; coffee, but not overpowering and for some reason, better than other coffee stouts for someone that is not a coffee drinker; now what does that mean to a coffee drinker, I do not know - this coffee, to me, just tastes better. 
One small bottle is more than enough, but this is one coffee stout, to me a style in itself that I would get a few more if I had the chance. Well made indeed. 1,177 charactersbrdc, May 11, 2008
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Good looker. Deep shades of brown not quite black with a very carbonated tan head. Fades into a milky topper swiftly leaving spotty lacing.
Nose is almost just pure coffee, almost stale in nature yet very brutal ing the glass. Coffee tanin even in the nose on this. You know that this is full of coffee when tannins hit your nose. A light amount of vanilla, black fruit, and dark chocolate are masked by the coffee.
Very tasty, very carbonated, and damn delicious. Prickly mouthfeel from the bitey carbonation which I normally don't like in a stout but the huge amounts of coffee on the middle and finish are made more approchable by having so much carbo. Some alcohol does show on the finish but not much. Much more dark chocolate, and black fruit comes through in the flavor. Still just coffee driven monster with only the slightest bit of RS on the finish and even a creamy lactose gesture which is then totally devoured by coffee tannin. 
Fine fine easy drinking stout. 976 charactersmcallister, May 11, 2008

Poured equal amounts into wine glasses and watched a surprisingly thick dark tan head form over a completely black viscous liquid. It finally subsided about 10 minutes later allowing the brew a chance to warm just a bit.
Huge espresso hit to the nose with this one. Perhaps a hint of chocolate on the nose as well but this is all about the espresso.
Supercharged with dark, bittersweet espresso taste, this brew coats the mouth with a creamy rich coffee blast that lingers long afterwards. Absolutely not a hint of the alcohol present. Its scary good. 
A terrific brew that complimented the Triple Chocolate Decadence brownies I had perfectly. 737 charactersTilley4, May 11, 2008

I had the earlier release of this beer a few years back in a bomber and it tasted completely different than this. The earlier bottle had a luxurious, velvety, espresso flavor. This newer release has a burnt coffee flavor. Decent mouthfeel, but I have to think that there is something slightly off with this bottle. 472 charactersFtownThrowDown, May 10, 2008

Strong espresso nose with malt background.
Great espresso taste, I could wake up to this stuff in the morning. A very intense stout to say the least. 
Great mouthfeel, I enjoy the carbonation. It gives a much lighter feel. Very smooth.
Great drinkability, but a definite sipper at the price it's available for now. But it's well worth it, not to mention how long it took me to get a hold of these bottles. 484 characterstechdiver, May 09, 2008

A - This is about as nice as they come. Pitch black with about a one inch foamy tan head head. Head dissapates slowly, leaving a layer of foam. Plenty of lacing on the glass.
S - Coffee up front with some roasted malt in the background.
T - Starts with some roasted malts and dark chocolate flavors and then moves to bitter coffee. The bitterness from the coffee and bitterness from the hops blend perfectly together and linger on the tongue for a while. As the beer warms up, some dark fruit flavors become present.
M - Thick and creamy. Carbonation is a little heavy at first.
D - This is almost too drinkable. I would never guess this to be close to %10 ABV. It's scary how drinkable this is.
I'd have to say this is the best coffee stout I've had, but if you're not a fan of coffee I could see you not liking it. To those who like coffee, this is a treat. 919 charactersmoose3285, May 09, 2008

4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From an 11.5oz bottle
Pours jet black with a good sized tan head, head is very similar to a cola at first by fading fast, slows down though and leaves some patchy lacing.
Smell has a strong presence of coffee, coffee, and a little bit of coffee, roasted malt in there as well.
Taste starts out with a carbonation kick which seems out of place, almost like a cola, after the onslaught of bubbles in the mouth is when the coffee taste kicks into gear and the beer becomes more creamy and thick. Not the creamiest stout I've had, as a result of the high carbonation, but it is rather viscous nevertheless. The strength is also well hidden, only a slight alcohol presence near the end, but it might also be the bitterness of the coffee, hard to tell.
Was it good, yes, was it worth what I paid, maybe, but I've had better stouts for lower costs. 845 charactersdeltatauhobbit, May 08, 2008

Smell: loads of roasted malts and coffee are up front and easy to detect.
Taste: full flavored and wonderful beer here. Loads of roasted malts, big coffee flavors, bitter chocolates and prunes are well balanced. Nice bitterness balances out the sweetness. Alcohol is very soft but warming.
Mouthfeel: heavy in body. Light crispness at the start but moves to a smooth velvety finish. Aftertaste is long as the coffee and roasted flavors linger on the tongue forever.
Drinkability: wonderful beer that is enjoyed slowly. One of the best big stouts I have ever had. 709 charactersGavage, May 07, 2008

Comparable flavor to KBS, but not quite the masterpiece, but close. Great coffee flavor with roasted malt and some sugary sweetness. Some slight chocolate. Very very robust flavor. some slight hints of vanilla in here. Mouthfeel is just a touch on the thin side, but quite good. Drinkability is excellent. The abv is dangerously well hidden. Overall a fantastic stout that will surely be appreciated by many. A great coffee stout. Defenitely my favorite beer from Canada so far. Excellent 697 charactersAKBelgianBeast, May 07, 2008

Pours opaque with a thin ring of foam and medium retention. Nose displays huge coffee/espresso with a little chocolate and hop bitterness in the background. The flavor is surprisingly smooth. Bitter chocolate, coffee, and a little light cocoa sweetness blend very nicely. High carbonation and some clean bitterness flushes the palate with each sip and makes you want more. Paired very nicely with some sharp and rich bleu cheese on the table.
Overall, I'm usually not real big on beers that have lots of coffee flavor, but this one is done very nicely. In fact, probably the best I've had. Highly recommend. 678 charactersmarksto, May 05, 2008
4.05/5  rDev -8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Wow! This is one delicious, roasty brew. As a coffee/espresso lover - this really hits home. Dark, but with a lasting head. Smells of espresso. Tastes of espresso. Bitter, deep, yet smooth. A tad lighter in body than Speedway, but I'd love to try them back to back. I hope I can get this one again!
Re-review 2009 : I hate to say, but either this hit me just right when I had it last year, or this latest batch wasn't the same. Thinner than I remembered, and too much of the powdery chocolate taste that a lot of stouts have. Still a good beer, but not nearly as good as my favorites (Speedway, Ten Fidy, Expedition, Stone). We'll try it again next year... 657 charactersJohnnyDuvel, May 02, 2008

4.97/5  rDev +13%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle courtesy gunhaver. Poured into a snifter. Deepest black with an inch of mocha head. Some scattered wet lacing.
Aroma is excellent, reminds me of a good British coffee porter with all the sweet creamed coffee. Nice bittersweet chocolate takes the sugary edge off it.
Flavor is hugely java-esque, with a bit of oatiness. It's got that sort of burnt, roasty finish that to me makes a great stout, as opposed to some that are sweet, boozy messes.
Mouthfeel is ridiculous. It has a heavy, creamy body with ample carbonation, but it just vanishes from the palate with an exquisite dryness that coerces the next sip. Outlandishly drinkable. 643 charactersillidurit, Apr 22, 2008

Bottle poured into a tulip glass produced a good finger worth of tan head that lasts. The body on this one was jet black in color
Aroma of coffee is strong along with the chocolate and a light sweetness (caramel) 
This tastes like a great cup of good coffee with enough malt sweetness to counter the roasted bitters 
A great mouthfeel on this one is just like Stout should be creamy smooth and just enough carbonation to keep it interesting 
Very drinkable, definite recommend. A awesome Sunday brunch brew 567 charactersjoepais, Apr 13, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +13%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Received this brew from DarkerTheBetter recently in a trade. I absolutely love coffee Stouts and this is the best of the best, can't wait! Drank from my Black Butte Porter pint glass.
Appearance- Pours midnight black with a nice one finger dark tan head. A cap and collar remains until the very bitter end of the beer and even then a huge collar remains. A bit of lacing is left reminding me of the sweet nectar that once was.
Smell- Thank the lord! I was worried this would be one of those "themed" stouts that wouldn't be dominated by the theme. Loads of roasted coffee beans are abundant in this one. Starbucks would be proud! A bit of bittersweet chocolate and some sweet caramel is noticeable.
Taste- Very roasted with plenty of dark bitter baker's chocolate before the coffee makes its presence known. Very bitter and powerful the coffee is the absolute focal point of this beer. Dark and roasted with a sweet caramel undertone before a bit of alcohol crashes the party. Finishes with a long French roasted coffee aftertaste that lingers on for days. Absolutely fantastic!
Mouthfeel- Medium to full body with a smooth creamy feel and medium sharp carbonation. A bit of warming after the swallow but nothing overly harsh.
Drinkability- After first taste, I really enjoyed this beer thought it had possibilities; after the second, I'm almost 100% sure this is the best beer I've ever tried (to date). The only complaint that I have with this brew is that it's a bit warm toward the end but a little bit of time will cure that nicely. Although if I had to choose between keeping the intensity of the coffee and or loosing a bit of warming, I'd definitely keep the coffee. Great beer that I thoroughly enjoyed (wish it was American), big thanks to Ed! 1,754 charactersyounger35, Apr 11, 2008

Smell: Ashen aroma of spent coffee grounds with some supporting notes of dark malts and semi-sweet chocolate.
Taste: Moderately sweet dark malts yield to a blast of roasty coffee and earthy bitterness. Hint of anise. The coffee flavor starts to take on a distinct burnt quality. Ashy finish. The alcohol is well hidden, I will give it that.
Mouthfeel: A bit beyond medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.
Drinkability: Instead of chiming in with a half-snotty remark, let's just say it's "alright" and leave it at that. 589 charactersChainGangGuy, Apr 10, 2008

Pours a creamy blackish black with black edging. Big deep tan head, beautiful cascading bubbles. 
Smell is surprisingly not huge on the coffee. It's there, to be sure, with some roasted malt and ... hops? 
The taste is delicious, robust, and the coffee really makes its appearance and overwhelms you. It's more espresso than anything else, and I'm hoping I'm going to be able to sleep tonight. Licorice, dark roasted malts, bitter hops, and chocolate balance the coffee-ness. If there's a downside, it's that there is a bit of charcoal/smokiness in the aftertaste that I found offputting ... but it's still a great beer.
Mouthfeel is thick and viscuous, if not tremendously "chewy." 723 charactersOverlord, Apr 09, 2008

Tastes of espresso, roasted malt, and licorice with a finish of coffee, hops, and alcohol. Full bodied, good carbonation.

A-Like most Imperial Stouts, it pours a deep dark black with hints of brown on the very edges when held up to the light. A very nice one finger medium brown head of dense foam appears, but doesn't disappear completely, instead settling to a 1/16" that stays while I drink... nice!
S-A nice casual coffee, roasted malt smell greets me. Not overly intense, but pleasant.
T-The coffee is the main feature here.... a nice roasted coffee, roasted grains taste. Chocolate, cocoa, almond and even a mild hint of licorice also appear. Some hops are hiding in the background but for the most part are an afterthought. I wavered on a higher rating for taste, but there is a very very faint metallic taste that's noticeable nonetheless...
M-When warmed up, the mouthfeel is sublime. Creamy, smooth, well carbonated (yet not overly so) and the thickness is spot on for this style.
D-Of course, the ABV would limit you to a couple, but it's highly drinkable, pleasant to drink, and worth searching out. 
I had this one hyped up in my mind and was rewarded with a delicious tasting, well made stout. Maybe not as much as I hoped, but would not hesitate to jump at the chance to obtain more.... 1,303 charactersEliteDigger, Apr 07, 2008

This is an outstanding imperial stout. Less coffee taste than I might have expected (compared to, say, Beergeek Breakfast or Bells Java Stout) after reading the label but this is outstanding nontheless. Very balanced and drinkable and delicious. I'm excited that we still have three more to enjoy.

Pours black with a medium nice head. Smell is lightly smoky, roasty, and coffee like. Taste is roasty coffee and rich dark chocolate with creamy cocoa like bittersweetness. Medium to thin bodied and very drinkable. Medium body and medium carbonation.

Drenched in coffee flavours. I'm not a coffee drinker but I love this beer nonetheless. It is a dangerous beer though. With its ABV of 9%, its smoothness, don't get too wild with the brew; you'll get pretty drunk in no time, trust me on that one ;-)
Try that with brie or a blue (stilton), you'll be amazed to see how complex this potion is. Also, some bitter chocolate will do it justice too. 497 charactersLeTonneau, Apr 04, 2008

341ml brown bottle poured into a tulip. No dating but from this recent batch.
A: Pours a pitch black body that isn't quite as viscous as I thought it'd be. A strong 2 finger light caramel head forms tight and holds well. A few wisps of lacing.
S: Rich, potent espresso. Dominance. Plenty of lightly burnt malts hide behind the coffee house. A touch of dry bitterness.
T/M: Much more of the espresso and very silky. Very dry and bitter with plenty of the charred malts. A little bit of chocolate mingles in the back and maybe some raisins? Alcohol is mild at first but really breaks through as it continues to warm. Alcohol never really gets in the way of things but it really does fight for power toward the end and warms throughout. Finishes very dry with some lasting bitterness. Full bodied with a smooth, velvety creaminess.
D: This is definitely a sipper, especially once it warms. Tasty brew. Very glad I got the chance to try this. 1,035 characterspwoods, Apr 04, 2008
4.9/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Sepiroth for this fine brew.
Pitch black in color. The head rises 3 fingers in height and 1/2" above the rim of the glass. It never spills over though using it's stickiness to hold it's shape. Head last until the glass is empty which was a lot sooner than I would expect. Incredible head for a 9% beer or any beer for that matter. Lace clings to the glass in large chunks.
Aroma is fresh ground coffee beans and a shot of espresso. The perfect aroma for coffee lovers, like me.
Flavor mimics the aroma well. COFFEE!!!! Again espresso and rich dark black coffee dominate the flavor profile. Also a hint of dark chocolate and as the beer warms the alcohol becomes a bit more noticable. Delicious beer. I love coffee beers and this and Pisgah Valdez are the two best.
Mouthfeel is rich, full, sharp and smooth. I don't remember a beer that has as much going on the palate as this one.
Drinkability is superb. This is the one area the Pisgah Valdez is a bit better than this classic coffee beer. Here the alcohol shines a bit more in the finish. But just enough to remind you that you are drinking beer. Which is a good thing. This is a beer for all of the coffee lovers out there.

A- Motor oil black with a brown active head with large bubbles that fade into a thin sandy layer. Rim edges bunch up with thicker head.
S- Super rich coffee beans with a rum like alcohol cutting through decisively. Some Kahlua, raosted/burnt marshmallow and chocolate chips.
T- Once again super rich cafe with dark chocolate and definetly alcohol heat. Molasses and carmelized sugar, deep dark blueberries fades into chocolate milkiness.
M- Creamy mouthfeel, but with sharp alcohol cutting through.
D- Great Imp Stout. Like a rich after dinner treat. If I could, I would probably drink several of these, but not really an option for me. Definelty does not try to disguise its 9.5% 752 charactersm1ked, Apr 01, 2008
4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Just purchased a case of this fine beer at the Beeryard in Wayne. Cheers to Matt!
Pours thick & black with a thin head. Big roasted coffee smell. Tastes mosty of the rich coffee with a hint of chocolate. Not as bitter as most coffee stouts which is a good thing IMO. Mouthfeel is nice and thick. The ABV is well hidden and this is very drinkable. This is a wonderful beer and worth hunting for.
Cheers! 404 charactersSkinnyElvis, Mar 29, 2008
4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours a reflective black that lets a touch of brown strawberry through the dimple in the bottom of my tulip. The head is a creamy tan that fell to a film.
Smells of cream and coffee, like some Starbucks creation. This leans towards the slightly sour side of coffee, but this nestles into a green but roasty wood, much like Breakfast Stout. 
In the flavor, it is hard to tell where the coffee ends and the roasty stout begins. Well done! It starts with a slick roasted barely that reminds me of both milk and dark chocolate but seamlessly transitions into a very solid and tasty coffee, or more like a subtle mocha. The sweet woody elements from the smell are here too. Finishes with a splash of delicate coffee.
Feels a bit slick and sticky with a swarm of bubbles that rather get in the way. Expected for the 9%, but they seem to challenge the flavors a bit. 
A tasty treat for sure and well worth the hype (and PA single bottle price). 951 charactersDarkerTheBetter, Mar 29, 2008
4.41/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had a friend who went to Montreal pick this up at Rahman's for me along with some anniversary Unibroue. As a coffee geek, I'm super excited to review this! Cellar temp. Dated 11/07. 9.50% abv, 341mL bottle. Poured into an oversized wine glass.
Stunning crema of a head (espresso reference), bits of lace all over the glass. Body that is like a black hole. No light at all penetrates this. Best looking beer I've ever seen.
Aromas of raisin, cardboard, dark, dark chocolate, nice caramel maltiness. Brandy cherries. Coffee is extremely well integrated. I get a nice roasty note from it but there is no 'coffeeness' in the aroma. 
Mouthfeel is big and chewy, with nice carbonation. Coats the teeth. Palate is... wow. Definitely very alcoholic with a bit of sweetness but explosively rich bitterness. Raisins are back. More chocolate. Coffee comes out here, finish explodes with the fresh brewed bitterness of an espresso ristretto in a dram of Ardbeg. Big smoky roasted character. Mouth drying. Extreme. 
My first review ever was Mill Street Coffee Porter. Suffice to say this blows it away.
Edit: had an americano the next day and I thought 'peche mortel' before I thought 'coffee'. There you go. 1,200 charactersAntilochus, Mar 28, 2008
4.32/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Received bottle via trade many moons ago.
Appearance: Pours a thick opaque black into a goblet style glass. Mocha colour head disappears rather quickly to a lacey ring with a small island floating in the centre. 
Aroma: Intense roasts coming out of this one. Espresso aroma absolutely dominates, however it is rich, roasty & intense, not like some of those other "coffee" beers that come across more as camp coffee flavour added to a porter. Alcohol is definately present as it whaffs up in between layers of espresso, dark roasted malts and burnt caramel.
Taste: More intense espresso flavours here. The initial blast is dry, astringent and very roasty, but the espresso comes through huge in the finish with a flavour that lingers endlessly. The bitter coffee flavour is sort of a love hate relationship similar to hoppy IPA's, you just can't help but drinking more.
Mouthfeel: If I searched for flaws, it is here. Could use a little more body to support the 9.5% abv, but it is certainly good as is. Carbonation is soft. Drinkability is high for it's style.
Final Statement: A remarkable achievement in beer. The perfect coffee beer. Highly recommend. 1,159 charactersMMansfield, Mar 25, 2008

Bière très opaque d'un brun expresso. Belle mousse foncée, d'une quantité et longueur très raisonnable. Apparence très attirante.
Au nez, des arômes de café et de chocolat sont évidents. On sent la lourdeur et la complexité du breuvage !
En bouche, le Péché Mortel porte bien son nom. Subtilité, équilibre, mais goût quand même bien prononcé. Les saveurs de café, de chocolat et de caramel s'entremêlent pour se compléter. Exceptionnel.
Bière très lourde et riche en bouche, elle en est d'autant plus agréable à boire. Un % d'alcool qui passe presque inaperçu ! 616 charactersAlexF, Mar 20, 2008
4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance - Black with a slight opacity as it thins - it looks much like espresso. The head falls flat a bit quickly, reducing to a small ring.
Smell - Intensely bold espresso with a touch of burnt toast.
Taste - Like a cappuccino with 80% espresso and 20% milk. It has a touch of sweetness, but the coffee flavor is intense and consuming, pushing the malt to the background. The burnt bready character from the aroma carries over, leaving an acrid, drying bitterness on the palate long after you've swallowed.
Mouthfeel - Rich, silky and deceptively drinkable.
Notes - A great coffee stout, one of the best I've tried. 624 characterslargadeer, Mar 14, 2008
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a nice black/red with a decent head. The smell never reached me until I poured this great brew. Once the smell reached my nose I detected alcohol, coffee, and oh yeah...coffee.
The taste is...ummm, coffee. I enjoy this brew. It had a slightly stale taste at the beginning. After that taste the stale taste never come back, thankfully.
Overall, this is a great beer. Not really what I was expecting BUT great none the less. 430 charactersiconoklaztor, Mar 12, 2008
4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a very dark black with a fine red tint toward the bottom of the glass. Small bubbles can be seen, and the head is very fine and dark tan with strong lacing.
Smells is of good with reasonable hoppiness. Not a whole hell of a lot going on, but I'm optimistic.
Upon tasting, the coffee flavor hits immediately. It's a bit more subtle than, say, the Breakfast Stout, but still very nice. The finish has a good alcohol taste with a bit of hoppiness. Not bad. A very good beer. I love coffee stouts.
Update: I just tried this one again. I would echo the nice coffee taste and lingering alcohol in the finish. To extend to comparison to the Breakfast Stout, I would say the coffee taste in this one is a bit more thin/watery that the BS but still quite good. 760 charactersbassmantin, Mar 12, 2008
3.88/5  rDev -11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to geuzelover for this sample.
Completely Black. Nice brown creamy head that leaves good lace.
Smokey charcoal, herbal coffee-like notes, bitter chocolate, some alcohol smell.
Slightly bitter coffee and dark chocolate flavors almost balance each other out, with the coffee having the edge. Herbal hop finish, tad astringent.
Soft creamy mouthfeel and medium body make it more drinkable. 397 charactersBeerZack, Mar 05, 2008

Poured a pitch black with no head to speak of. Nose was coffee and chocolate with some bourbon alcohol. Taste was espresso and bitter chocolate with some woodiness. Mouthfeel was pretty smooth, nicely carbonated, and didn't stick around much.
This was a very, very nice stout. Would definitely enjoy another. 352 characterstriplecoil, Mar 02, 2008

A- Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a black with no head.
S- Very odd nose. Almost super gluey. I get some of the dark malts with coffee and chocolate. A bit of charcoal on the nose too.
T- Coffee for sure. This has a strong acetyl taste too. I really like how it tastes but it is an odd flavor at the front. Very little hop character.
M- Good carbonation. This is a beer that you taste then it is gone. It does not stick around in your mouth very long.
D- I got a couple bottles of this and I am very happy to dispose of it. I like this beer a lot. 616 charactersMudpuppet, Mar 01, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +13%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Well it's review number 300 for me and I have been saving this one for several months until I hit this milestone. A big thanks goes out to franksnbeans for sending this one over.
A: Pours black as night with a huge two finger espresso colored head. The head lingered for quite some time before dying down to a simple collar. Nice thick lacing in spots. Overall a lovely looking beer.
S: Wow coffee to the max. Tons of fresh brewed coffee aromas come wafting from the glass. The coffee aromas are backed by just a hint of charcoal. A tinge of sweetness can be detected, but the pure coffee aroma of this one is better than those found in world's best coffee houses.
T: Holy Shit!!! This is the one; I have died and gone to heaven. This one gets my highest marks. The taste is off the charts. Tons of fresh espresso hits the tongue and rushes thru the mouth and down the throat. The flavor was so intense. It just hung around on the tongue with the perfect degree of bitterness. There were hints of charcoal and smoke, but the coffee is what this one is all about. I started drinking this one at 51 degree and let it warm from there. As it warmed just a hint of sugary sweetness and milk can be detected beneath the wonderful coffee taste.
M: Medium bodied, very smooth almost creamy. This beer went down wayyy tooo good for 9 percent. God I am in heaven.
D: Uber, the best, I love it. The perfect beer for morning noon or night.
Well folks I didn't think the day would come but here it is about as close to 5.0 as you can get. I absolutely love good espresso and beer. So much that my 3 year old greets everyone by telling them "my daddy drinks coffee and beerer" Yes she calls it beerer. This concoction is the perfect marriage between the two. From the first drink I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I love Bell's Java and ST Jah-Va, but this beer is in a class all its own.
Do what you have to do to get it, and if you have extra give me a shout I will give my left arm to drink the foam.
franksnbeans thanks for letting me try this "mortal sin" I am truly indebted to you for this one. 2,102 characterstpd975, Feb 23, 2008
4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.512 ounce bottle from seaoflament, thanks a lot for trading me this treat from Canada, poured into my Russian River pint glass tonight while watching the season finale of Prison Break
A-Black color with absolutely no light shining through, the tan head was so big, about two inches, that it overflowed all over my counter, nice retention as well, probably about five minutes, some impressive sticky lacing towards the beginning
S-Aroma was like a fresh cup of coffee with no half and half or sugar, just straight, also dark chocolate, roasted malts, as it warmed there was a hint of fermented raisins and prunes, coffee was almost completely in charge though
T-Very similar to its scent, huge coffee flavor during the whole hour plus that I was drinking it, tasted some nice sweet cream which added some deep complexity to the brew about a half hour into it and it continued to get stronger as time went on, did not taste dark fruit at all, just a little milk and some extremely dark chocolate causing some bitterness in the aftertaste, nicely balanced overall, think hoppiness would have just ruined what this beer was about, very enjoyable and I wish I had more than a single bottle
M-Dry mouthfeel caused by the abundance of coffee, a little bitter at first, then became nice and creamy, thick super black body, does not stick to tongue very much or cause a noticeable sensation, light carbonation that fit it well
D-Bottle actually says 9.5%, did not seem like though because the alcohol was hidden so well, taste does not get tiresome, not that heavy on the stomach, would have gotten a perfect score here if it was not so strong, very smooth and easy to drink
Have really wanted to try this brew since joining this site, have heard nothing but great things about this brewery in the past, will definitely drink again in the future and stock up on it when I finally make it Quebec some time, cannot wait to visit the source of this great beer, highly recommended even if you are not a big can of coffee in your brew, unforgettable taste, need more of this stuff soon 2,076 charactersFloydster, Feb 19, 2008

Big coffee and bitter chocolate aroma, soft astrigent aroma of fresh ground coffee. Mouthfeel is silky and soft with a carbonation that scrubs the palate clean having you want more. Flavor is coffee, burt malts, and dark coco, it is quite a delicate beer. It's not a "in your face" stout as one sometimes gets with these big dark brews.
Very balanced, quite dangerous as the glass goes down fast and the alcohol is very well cloaked. 538 charactersbloberglawp, Feb 16, 2008
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512 oz bottle dated November 2007.
Pours opaque black with a one-plus inch head of dense, brown froth. Very pillowy and soft in appearance.
Aromatics are loaded with strong coffee, bitter chocolate, and roasted malts.
Very roasty and chocolatey with plenty of espresso notes.
The mouthfeel is smooth and thick. Chewy with gription aplenty. Drying but still plenty of residual tackiness.
The pallet is assertively packed with heavily roasted coffee oils, dark chocolate, and char. 
All the flavors are layered perfectly, even for a beer so top-heavy with coffee.
Hopping is minimal, and the biiterness seems to come from the coffee. 
Finishes slightly warming, with lingering coffee and chocolate, and a hint of vanilla.
I think the key to this beer is the an extremely high grade of coffee beans, and the balancing thats achieved with them.
I would love to try this one after spending some time in a bourbon barrel. 917 charactersbrewandbbq, Feb 12, 2008
4.63/5  rDev +5.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is the first in a series of highly aclaimed stouts I have been waiting to try for some time. 
A milk chocolate brown head with big bursting foam bubbles races to 3 fingers and has amazing retention. Body is as black as Elvira's eye shadow. Nose is big with fresh coffee but also brownies with walnuts baked in. Super smooth on first sip as it rains off the tongue and floods the mouth with creamy sweetness. Roasted coco beans are rich and stay chocolatey on the back of tongue long after each swallow. An ever so slight bitterness does arrise twords the end of the palate, but this just adds to the balance. Some winey dark fruits even show there face as the beer warms a bit. Rich bitter coffee like feel makes up a long but welcome mouthfeel. Alchol is well disguised and only shows itself in the belly. A very very good stout worthy of all the praise over the years. 876 charactersSPLITGRIN, Feb 12, 2008
4.79/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Deep black appearance. Thin, tan foam rests atop, but only for a moment as a pencil thin ring survives. The smell is very intense, with charred, roasty coffee beans, and dark chocolate galore. Hints of cherry and mild alcohol peer through as you smell further. Amazing.
The taste has a strong coffee character with the bitter roast keeping my lips smacking. Drying finish with a long lingering bitter chocolate note. So well balanced, never too sweet, it's too easy to drink for its strength. The mouthfeel has quite a bit of carbonation for a stout, very nice but bordering on too much perhaps? Very smooth, not overly chewy thick. 
This beer has amazing flavor, perhaps not the ultimate in complexity, but it's well rounded enough that I could drink one anytime, all the time. Thanks to northyorksammy, I've been wanting to try this one for awhile... 854 charactersbennetj17, Feb 10, 2008

A: Pours a dark brown under a half fingers worth of brown head. A little bit of lace and some wispy retention. 
S: Smells of raw coffee, a little bit of sweet cream, maybe some very dark fruit thrown in and some roasted malt. Coffee is the main character here though.
T: Just like the nose, big coffee, a hint of a sweet chocolate, a little bit of alcohol on the back of the tongue and roasted malt bitterness in the finish. Big bitter coffee aftertaste.
M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is light, a little slick on the tongue. Drinkability is good on this one, smells and tastes like a cup of coffee. If you love coffee, you could easily tie this one on. 732 charactersNCSUdo, Jan 31, 2008

Wow. 
Poured jet black with a creamy tan topping of fine bubbles that leaves a nice tan ring of sticky lace.
Aroma is pure coffee...rich, dark, espresso coffee.
Taste is again, espresso coffee...fresh and rich...just enough cream and sugar to balance the bitterness of the coffee. Dries to a nutty kind of coffee bean aftertaste that makes you think of starbucks...lots.
Alcohol is totally hidden. 438 charactersIntriqKen, Jan 10, 2008
4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bomber served at cellar temperature and poured into a Middle Ages Imperial Pint Glass
A  Poured a thick as molasses oil like liquid which slowly churned around and settled into my glass giving off a huge billowing pillow like head of tan colored frothy suds that just seemed to keep rising until it reached the very lip of the glass. Once it decided to stop growing it eventually came back down to the top of the thick viscous liquid leaving behind just tons of side glass lace. There was really a thick and warm look to this one, really, the classic look of a good RIS.
S  The aroma was loaded down with coffee, literally just a ridiculously strong aroma of deep roasted coffee with a nice amount of sugary sweetness added in. This was truly a coffee stout if I had ever smelled one. There was no touch of alcohol present in the aroma at all; it was just a healthy mixed of roasted coffee beans, sweet lactose sugar, and a nice full roasted malt attack. The aroma was very full really full and one of the tightest and most full of coffee that I have seen in quite some time.
T  Where to start here. First off I had to mention this somewhere so I might as well mention it here. There was definitely caffeine present in this. When I first opened this bottle I was quite tired, and by half way through the first pint I was wide awake, the coffee in here was so evident that it literally wired me. A very strange feeling indeed and not one I was expecting. The flavor was full on rich coffee stout. Lots of espresso like flavors, a, mild hint of vanilla and a ton of lactose sugar was what I had greeting me. The finish was very dry and drawn out with that long lingering weird kind of buzz feeling you get after a couple cups of coffee. A really nice little picks me up. No hint of the alcohol in here at all, this was all big time stout, and really wonderful at that.
M  This was definitely a large full bodied dessert beer. Very thick, almost like a shake in consistency but it never got dull due to the large amount of carbonation that was present throughout the entire session. Really rich I actually was sipping on this most of the time because it was just a really thick and creamy stout and a gulp would simply be a waste.
D  Superb, I would have loved to have another of these. The alcohol you would think would catch up to you after a bit, but I guess the caffeine evened it out, but by the end I was raring to go and definitely would have loved to have had another one. I could see putting down this on a regular basis and making it a regular in the winter rotation would be an easy thing to do.
Overall this was excellent, really a finely crafter beer and one of the best examples of the style I have ever seen. The use of coffee was superb and the sweetness brought into the mix really helped to balance out the whole profile. This was easily something I would have to recommend and to be honest, something I would really like to seek out. Go get this if you can. 2,994 charactersmikesgroove, Jan 03, 2008

The head is 1 small finger, dark mocha, fades to a ring and leaves little lace. A swirl of the glass picks the head right back up, Nice. I would like to see a thicker coating on the glass and some lace.
The smell is great, Lots of big strong coffee, and a bit of earthy hops is detectable.
The Taste is very good, yet it seems to be one dimensional not very complex. The coffee is strong, and bitter, could have a bit of dark chocolate as well. The after taste is great as well.
The mouthfeel is outstanding, wow is it great, a velvety smooth creamy feel over the back of the tongue. The carbonation feel is excellent and the body is just short of full making this beer really outstanding.
The drinkability is Excellent, I sure wish I could buy this here.
Big thanks to Northyorksammy for this excellent brew.

Bottled on 08/05
A: Pours a pure ebony. Quoting Spinal Tap here, "none more black". Creamy two finger, espresso crema colored head that leaves random gobs of lace coating the glass.
S: Heavenly aromas of dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, espresso, brown sugar, raisins, chocolate covered cherries, etc...
T: Huge espresso/dark roast coffee flavors, along with bitter dark chocolate, burnt black roasted malt, cocoa powder, chocolate milk, raisins, spiced plums, fresh green hops, and brown sugar/molassas. Amazing!
M: At once bitter and creamy. The bitter coffee and hops do a spicy little dance on the tongue that lasts a long time. Absolutely masterful!
D: Incredible! This is the last of a three bottle Peche Mortel haul I made and I've been sitting on this bottle for about a year now. I am amazed at how sharp and flavorful it has remained (especially the hop flavors). Why is it that the good ones are so hard to find? 1,017 charactersGbVDave, Dec 27, 2007
4.78/5  rDev +8.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I was pumped to see this beer in a 6-pack...until I visited the brewery and found this beer on-tap two days later. This beer was poured into a tulip and cost me $5.25. On to the beer:
This beer is as black as night, topped by a milky tan head. This is one of the most beautiful presentations I've seen. A beautiful coffee aroma rises from the beer and it isn't very heavy smelling. Now it gets interesting, I don't drink coffee, but this beer is highly rated. I'm afraid to go along any further with this...
Oh good lord, delicious! Is this coffee, or is this a stout? The two parts create a perfect marriage of flavor. Is this the mortal sin? I'm going to be going to hell after I'm finished with this. Unbelievably smooth. Alcohol is very well hidden. It's surprisingly sweet like chocolate given the coffee flavor put into the beer, which pleasantly lingers on the palate after every sip is complete. 
Ever seen a grown man cry? My draft is finished and I want more. I now feel very spoiled trying the draft version, and it lives up to the clippings, and more. But I can relive the experience at a later time after buying a 6-pack, which currently sits in the refrigerator of my house.
How highly acclaimed is this beer? Well, when I was at the brewpub, the bartender shared stories of customers driving 10 hours out of their way and paying as much as $80 a bottle to try it! 1,382 charactersDoubleJ, Dec 26, 2007

Poured into my Surly Darkness glass. A seemingly worthy beer for the darkness. Beautiful ebony with a surprising amount of milk chocolate head. Nose- all about the coffee so far. Really nice roast- not too dark. First sip- wow what a mouthfeel. Just glides on down. Really unique- the particular coffee used along with the drak malts imparts a sharp bitterness/burntness to it. A much darker burnt roasting than the nose suggests. At the same time, there is a touch of sweetness to the malts. very complex brew and commands attention! Very drying in the finish. Excellent beer, but the strong ash/burtness is a little overdone. 661 charactersoakbluff, Dec 15, 2007

Aroma consists of espresso type coffee with some notes of black chocolate. Taste is a well balance mix between some sweet and roasted malt with a dominant taste of espresso coffee with some notes of black chocolate. Very well balance overall with a full body and a creamy texture. Not cloying or overly dry in any way and alcohol is not apparent. 463 charactersPhyl21ca, Dec 10, 2007

Notched date of Sept. 07. This bottle has many miles on it... from Quebec, to South Carolina, to Northern California.
Beer pours a thick flat black color, with a decent sized off white head on top.
Aromas are coffee dominant. Sweet and sugary with dark coffee notes along with some cocoa as well.
First sip, mmm... definitely coffee forward on the flavors. But not overpowering, and very natural tasting. Some coffee beers I have tasted seem to taste like with coffee flavors that seem artificial. Not here. A sweet cocoa like flavor, dark bakers chocolate, and of course brewed dark coffee. Finish is dry and slightly bitter as well.
Mouthfeel is good. Feels a touch thin for a Double Stout, but it's certainly not bad.
Drinkability is very good. The hype is justified. This is an excellent stout. I prefer this to the two "Breakfast" stouts from Founders. I bet this beer would even taste good served hot. 960 charactersflexabull, Nov 26, 2007

I've only given one other perfect score(Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout) but this one is my new benchmark brew. The coffee aroma is intense. Dark robusta espresso smell and flavour. This beer was velvety and incredibly smooth on the tongue. The aftertaste is so rich, it leaves a mocha flavour on your tongue that lasts. Alcohol is listed on the bottle as 9.5% but I can't tell when I'm drinking it. It is so well hidden that it sneaks up on you. It also seems to give you a serious caffeine buzz. So drinkable, this beer will keep you wanting more, but if you want to remain coherent, 1 is enough in a sitting. 
A great winter beer, I am going to savour this 6-pack all season long. It's among the best in the world and is worth seeking out. 828 charactersHornet2003, Nov 22, 2007

Dark chocolate black body with a finger of lacy, cobwebby, cocoa brown head. Roasted coffee bitterness with oily dark chocolate, black licorice, vanilla, tobacco, and dark rummy fruit sweetness. 
Crazy roasted malt and coffee bitterness up front. Dark, strong espresso-like in intensity. Hints of dark, stewed, sweetish fruits show through mid-palate. Oily, rich, intense roasted coffee and dark chocolate bitterness take over again though and dominate through the finish. Wow. This is the strongest coffee-tasting beer I have ever had! Full-bodied with an oily feel. I am afraid that this will keep me up all night! 670 charactersalexgash, Nov 19, 2007

Smell: Rich espresso, with undertones of chocolate, vanilla and scorched raisins
Taste: Opens with an espresso flavor that builds a chocolatey, but fruity, presence through mid-palate; after the swallow, a changing bitter complexity springs the additional flavors of vanilla and burnt tobacco, but the overall effect is just a really bitter cup of espresso
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and creamy with modest carbonation

4.46/5  rDev +1.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Very dark red when coming out of the bottle. In the glass it is opaque, black, and generated a creamy, two finger mocha head. As the head slowly starts to recede, a sheet of lacing coats the entire glass. Really, I don't think it could look any better.
Smells strongly of roasted coffee. Bitter chocolate fills in after that, but it is pretty heavy on the coffee smell.
Semi-sweet chocolate flirts with the tongue at first, then a creamy, roasted coffee flavour fills the mouth. Hints of vanilla pop up here and there. Lingering sweetened coffee fills the nose after a few sips, while coffee bitterness sits on the tongue. No sign of alcohol within the flavour, it is well masked.
The mouthfeel is simply perfect. I don't think I've ever had a beer so creamy. Carbonation is there, but just enough to keep the body alive.
Considering the strength, and the fact that I'm not a coffee drinker, this is one very drinkable stout. I have to pace myself, as I don't want it to be over too soon. Fantastic beer, my thanks again to my friend Jay who delivered a mix of Dieu du Ciel beers after a recent trip to Montreal. 1,116 characterselricorico, Nov 07, 2007

4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottled August 2005. Pours black with a light brown and tan head, some yeast remnants evident in the end of the pour, the head recedes to a ring. Strong roasted malt and earthy aroma, slightly twangy but mainly roasty with some coffee and sweet cola in the aroma as well. Coffee and roasted malts up front are soon followed by a strong sweet cola presence in the taste. A soft and subtle chocolate sweetness in the background of the medium body, finishing with a tangy roastiness that dwells into the somewhat dry aftertaste. Sweet cola seems to dominate the taste, hard to belive the alcohol is 9 percent as it is fairly non evident. This beer is holding up great for being nearly two years old, if the bottle wasn't marked I could easily guess it a fresh beer. Very nice beer when you're in the mood for a coffee stout. Thanks Dave for the opportunity. 854 charactershoppymeal, Jun 01, 2007
4.97/5  rDev +13%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 55/11/07- Received via trade with Jetsbeer.
Presentation- 22oz bottle that was bottled in Aug 2005. Poured into my Duvel tulip.
Appearance- Deep brown, almost into black. Full inch plus head which keeps at a solid 1/4-1/2 inch after it settles. Decent patches of lacing left behind.
Smell- Heavy roasted almost burnt malt nose. Lots and lots of coffee goodness. A touch of chocolate and maybe a bit of molasses as well. Excellent nose which I didn't want to stop smelling.
Taste- Most intense coffee flavor in any beer I have had. Large deep roasted malt flavor with a nice backing of extreme bittersweet chcoolate. Great sweetness with a nice hoppy punch.
Mouthfeel- About the perfect carbonation level for a stout...low. A bit creamy with a nice thickness.
Drinkability- Damn, I really can't find much at all wrong with this beer. Frankly it's pretty damn incredible. It was aged for almost two years. I wonder what fresh would taste like or if I had sat it down for another year or so. Mucho thanks to Jetsbeer for this wonderful experience! 1,061 charactersGClarkage, May 22, 2007

Pours a deep dark brown-black, a touch of tan head on top that dissolves eventually. Nose is nice and strong, lots of coffee and chocolate tastiness. Taste is delicious. Similar to the head, although exceedingly smooth. Lots of coffee deliciousness, with a good amount of roasted malt, a little citrus, caramel malt, really a tasty and smooth beer - can't conceive of anyone not feeling this one. Feel is full and smooth, tasty. Drinkability is high; I can't believe this one is so high in ABV cause the alcohol does not even show up a bit. Really a fantastic beer, one that I will try and find again. 678 characterssoupyman10, May 19, 2007
3.93/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Re-review (original at bottom)
Got in a trade with johnnnniee - many thanks! Poured from a 11.5oz bottle (no dating info) into a pint glass. It was pitch black even against the light. Good carb and some lacing. It had a finger of brown head that slowly settled into a constant foam fed by carb in the center. My last one was over a year old so this seems to be fresher. 
The aroma was still coffee, coffee but now had more of a roasted malt smell and none of the alcohol that I found last time. Not a coffee drinker but I do love the aroma. The taste was much better this time. Also, I've had several more coffee beers lately so I've acquired a better appreciation for them. It's still a little one dimensional but does taste good. Less ice coffeeish this time. Mouthfeel good and creamy.
Overall, a really good beer that I'm glad I got to try again. Still not a top 100 for me but again can see why it gets high praise. Who knows, maybe in a few years I'll grow to appreciate coffee beers even more and this will jump up again. I do highly recommend as it is a great example of what a coffee beer can be. For now though, I'm good for a few years before trying it again. Would love to try some of the other beers from them though.

Got in a trade with BeerBeing - thanks! Bottled in Aug 2005. Has a cool label with a picture of Eve and the snake and a story about the name Peche Mortel (mortal sin). Was a 660ml bomber and poured into my trusty pint glass. Was pitch black in color. Had a two finger brown head that quickly settled to a partial thin foam. Lacing was minimal. The aroma was coffee, coffee, coffee with a good hint of the alcohol within. The flavor has been described by others as ice coffee and I'd agree. Mouthfeel nice and solid. To be fair, I'm not a coffee drinker and generally don't like things with a lot of coffee flavor so the taste and drinkability take some hits for that. Still, I'd highly recommend this especially if you like coffee. Not a top 100 for my tastes but I can see why it gets a high rating by others. Was great to try once.

4.94/5  rDev +12.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanx to that dude whose name I can't remember who was kind enough to share a bottle at the 2007 Pizza Port Belgian Beer Fest.
The beer poured a deep coal black with a minimal light brown head.
The aroma of the beer was dominated by intense coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts. It reminded me of the smells when walking into a gourmet coffee shop (Peets). There were sweet malts in the background and a good amount of alcohol to help carry things to your nose. No hops were in the aroma.
The flavor of the beer was fueled by intense espresso, chocolate, and roasted malts. There was nice backbone of base malts that filled out the flavors and were neither too sweet nor too dry. The complex layers of extreme coffee and roasted flavors blew me away. I've certainly never had a coffee infused beer that was quite like this. There was enough hop bitterness to balance things out, but the hops certainly took a back seat. There was minimal fruitiness in this beer, which was perfect.
The mouthfeel was medium and helped conceal the 9% ABV very well - to almost dangerous levels in fact. The carbonation was dialed in perfectly. The beer also had a brilliant creaminess to it that further pushed the flavor envelope.
This is a magnificent beer and perfect in every one of its complex dimensions. It was almost like drinking a perfectly pulled double espresso with a shot of alcohol. 1,394 charactersSacoDeToro, Mar 30, 2007

This produced a big, thick, deep-brown head with magnificent retention. The color was black. Jet black. Black as the Ace of Spades, it was. Even the white bits was black. Oh, aye, it were black. The nose gave off light banana esters with a heavy burnt-bean coffee scent overlaying everything. The mouthfeel was thick and chewy with a charcoal taste on the tongue. The finish was biting with a burnt aspect to it followed by a smokiness on the extreme finish. I was actually starting to sweat from drinking this one! 726 characterswoodychandler, Feb 18, 2007
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4The final beer from my sampler at the Sunset Grill and Tap - 5 oz. in a miniature pokal-type glass. It is possibly the most beautiful stout I have yet encountered: jet black, with a quarter inch of dense tan head. After taking an hour to eat dinner and review my first three samples, the head did not budge one millimeter, and it retained for the additional half-hour it took to consume and review this beer - I've rarely seen such head retention, especially in a brew of this strength. The aroma is packed with espresso, hot chocolate, and roasted malts - reminiscent of kahlua mixed with creme de cacao. There is a huge espresso presence on the palate with notes of chocolate/creme de cacao, apple?, green hops, and an assertive bitterness on top of a thick, incredibly smooth, drying, almost powdery body that leaves a prolonged finish, lasting until it is washed away when "Oaked, Smoked, and Ruined" with the Bros. and other BAs at the Deep Ellum. Overall an expressive coffee stout loaded with flavor, and one I was happy to find (especially on-tap), but it was a bit too much in some respects. 1,100 charactersmmmbeer, Feb 14, 2007

4.68/5  rDev +6.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Drank on-tap at the Sunset Grill & Tap, Allston, MA
Poured a super thick and viscous pitch black with a tight, creamy, mocha-colored, one-finger head that lasted through most of the drink. Huge blankets of lacing covered the glass.
Aroma was sweet, smooth and quite fragrant. Notes of deep, roasted malts and freshly brewed coffee were apparent along with subtle hints of vanilla.
Taste was similar, except perhaps a bit more dark and roasty. Creamy, rich and a touch sweet on the front end, with espresso, toasted malts and sweet cream noticeable. Dark chocolate came through mid-palate before the deep, burnt malts and roasted espresso flavors appeared. A touch of alcohol was detectable as well. As the beer warmed, powdered cocoa became significantly more apparent in both the aroma and the taste. The finish was super dry and a bit hoppy, with some noticeable residual sugars. The lingering aftertaste rotated between roasted malts, espresso and dark chocolate.
Mouthfeel was terrific. Creamy, smooth and super thick, the beer felt like a blanket on my tongue.
Drinkability was outstanding. At 9% ABV, the alcohol was dangerously undetectable.
Overall, an outstanding stout, ideal for savoring on its own. 1,216 charactersDamian, Feb 04, 2007

Pours out black with a creamy off-white head that leaves very good lacing. A little more head and I'd have given it a 5. Smell is full of coffee, hints of nuts and cocoa are present as well. To be honest, this one smells and tastes of a Christmas morning breakfast one could conceivably only think about. Waking up to the perfect blend of coffee with some vanilla whipping on top. That's what this beer is; don't let it fool you, there is a lot of coffee, but this is no simple beer for simple-minded folk. Mouthfeel is creamy and rich, I wanted more and more but I had to pace myself or Christmas would go by much too fast. An exceptional beer for sure, one I will be seeking out again. I can only imagine a fresher bottle would show me how badass this beer really is. 798 charactersbadbeer, Feb 02, 2007

The taste is a big hit of different coffee tones that hit you from first sip until the aftertaste which is a great coffee flavor. There are also notes of nice chocolate.

4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured out like a dark Guiness, black with a cascading light brown head, thick and creamy. The nose was wonderful freshly roasted and ground coffee, cherry, a bit of chocolate, alcohol, and a bitter/sour component, marvelously balanced.The taste starts like a hug amount of the best most deeply roasted coffee you've ever had, then goes sour and bitter before coming back with a slightly bitter coffee finish. There's a hint ofalcohol heat and some cherry along the way. The mouthfeel is in my opinion what makes this beer. It is at once creamy and smooth as well as crisp and clean. It's a big boy of a beer, but it was a great treat.
As far as I know (or frankly, as far as I could understand the waiter who served me), this beer is only available at the Brasserie in Montreal. They do bottle it, but it's not allowed to be taken off the premesis. There are apparently plans to expand the production facilities and distribute the beer. My waiter said sometime in the spring it should be more widely available. Also, a big thanks to him, it wasn't on the menu, but he managed to snag me one from their private stock in the basement. 1,136 charactersdherling, Jan 11, 2007

Bottled April 05
Poured into a chalice a black color, nice carbonation, not much of a head or lacing afterwards. Looks like some oil slick on top. The nose is of roasted malts, hops, toffee aplenty, and slight alcohol. The taste is superb of malts/hops, and tons of toffee. I believe I've never so far had a brew with this much toffee in it. Nice warming effect when going down. Medium body, well rounded brew. Very drinkable, a very very nice American Double Stout. 511 charactersWasatch, Jan 01, 2007

A: The stout is a thick oily mess. It is pitch black with no light escaping it and appears very viscous. The head comes close to 2 fingers on pour and dissapates to an off-white covering on top of the glass.
S: The aroma is a thick concentrated grainy malt. The increased malts have given the ale a roasted and sweet sugary depth.
T: The stout lives up to both imperial and coffee. The first flavors to register are deeply roasted malts that have a chocolate taste and are full of sugary sweetness. The flavor is very thick. On top of the roasted flavors is a strong coffee body. The coffee is dry, making it a nice compliment to the sweet stout flavor. As the stout sits on the palate a bit, the acidic coarseness of coffee beans (and grounds) comes through, adding a bite to the end of the sip.
M: The imperial roasted stout flavors, sugary depth and coffee intensity make for a well-rounded and delicious taste.
D: The stout is absolutely drinkable. A big dark murky brew full of robust stout and coffee flavors, this is a must have. 1,188 charactersakorsak, Jan 01, 2007
4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bottled 08/2005, cellared for a year. 
I've been waiting to try this one, based on recommendations to let it mellow a tiny bit. 
Pour a deep mahogany hue, pitch black in the pint glass. Billowing head, irregular bubbles, later subsides but never disappears. 
Smell is rich coffee, also a touch sweet. Maybe a lactic note in there too. 
Taste lives up to the hype. It's full, rich, and strong. Resiny fair-trade coffee grinds, mixed with a dense roasted malt. Alternately bitter and roasty, with a sweet flash in between. This isn't especially complex, but it's a perfectly symbiotic marriage of coffee and stout. The richness is unsurpassed in my coffee stout experience. 
Mouthfeel is full and velvety, lives up to the price tag. No harshness, alcohol is expertly hidden. 
Due to it's overwhelming qualities, one bottle is enough in one sitting. Worth trying once in a lifetime... 899 charactersemerge077, Jan 01, 2007

All black, with a medium brown, tighly bubbled, fizzy head that actually managed to hang out for a bit. The aromas and flavors are all Starbucks. Maybe one of the venti mochas or macchiatos that I get on Fridays because they open at 0520 instead of 0600. I have to say, this is the second coffee imperial stout Ive had in three days (Southern Tier Javah), and I really dont like the way carbonated coffee feels on my tongue. It almost feels like Im eating a damn cactus. I can certainly see why this beer scores well. Its big and bold, and it will put you down in a hurry. I just cant see myself really enjoying this beer regularly. 751 characterstjthresh, Dec 02, 2006

Nice label. Nice bottle. Ugly price tag... I hope she is worth it.
Appearance: Atramentous as a tar pit. Complete in its opacity with a wonderful mocha head. Superb clinging, retention, and lacing.
Aroma: Freshly roasted espresso beans. A touch of cocoa. As a coffee drinker since age two, I cant help but drool over beers like this.
Taste/feel: Like enjoying a richly dense Hagendaaz coffee milk shake with added espresso and cocoa syrup. The intensity of the coffee is mind blowing. Its like they packed Juan Valdezs entire donkey in this one little bomber. I find some tobacco present as well as some burnt dark chocolate but at the end of the day this is a coffee beer through and through.
Drinkability: Perfect. I could sit in a café and drink this from one sunup to the next.
Is it worth it? For me, it is certainly worth the splurge to try it once but in comparison to similar beers from Bells, Alesmith, and Founders it just doesnt hold up for repeated visits because of price and obscurity. 1,070 charactersDaPeculierDane, Nov 28, 2006

My review got cut a bit short because while I was minding my own business enjoying the Mortal Sin out my Péché Mortel Woody walks out with freaking SA Utopias MMIII. Anyway I got plenty of notes on my Péché Mortel but not as many adjectives as I will the next time I get my mits on some.
Appearance: Pours black with a tan head and terrific walls of light cocoa colored lacing.
Smell: Rich coffee and sweet frapaccino mocha caramel molasses chocolate scents.
Taste: Absolutely exceptional flavor of coffee and dark chocolate; big time espresso flavors with a hint of vanilla on the cheeks and caramel-dark-fudge sweetness. 
Mouthfeel: The roasty malty lends a hint of dryness and yet it is creamy and smooth as velvet.
Drinkability: 5.0 doesn't even begin to describe. I am a huge coffee fan. Drinking gallons of fine coffee every day I could easily drink this every night. That said it is certainly a sipping and enjoy every moment of it, beer.
Hope this is helpful.

4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a somewhat thin black with red edges. Slightly fizzy head that quickly disappears. Smell is of nothing but espresso beans. Taste is very smooth and espresso dominated. Sweetness comes through in the finish, toffee and caramel. There is some chocolate here too, huge and bitter. This is massive!! The alcohol comes through in the end too, once your palate gets used to the espresso taste. Mouthfeel seems a little thin for the amount of dark flavors here. 
Very well done and if you like espresso this is your brew. Very expensive, $16 for a bomber in Ohio, and I bought 3. One to sample and 2 to lay down for a few months. Closest competition is Bell's Java Stout or Alesmith Speedway. I really should do a tasting with my Dark Lord included. 749 characterskirok1999, Nov 21, 2006

660 ml bottle
Bottled 08/05, sinned upon 11/06
Medium pour in a large tulip glass
Poured dark as night with a light brown creamy mostly lasting head with good lacing.
Smelt of strong coffee and dark chocolate with moderate to light anise, vanilla creaminess, dark fruit, figs.
Taste was upfront pure strong coffee taste with a light sweet burnt sugar/molasses, some soy, vinous and clean dark soil tastes followed by more strong coffee and dark chocolate tones, a little crisper and a slight hop perfume on a long finish. Palate was medium to full bodied, creamy, softly carbonated, with a moderate alcoholic warmth.
Overall, this tastes more like premium coffee than beer, but the alcoholic warmth and dark malt undertones support it well. Showcases the coffee bean magnificently, yet the strong coffee taste hides the subcomponents and complexity unless one looks carefully for them.
Much thanks to JesseDaniels for sharing this gem. 979 charactersxav33, Nov 12, 2006
4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On cask at Volo Cask Days 2006. Thanks to Dieu du Ciel guys for making the trek out and bring great beer to Toronto.
Pours deep dark black, some red in the edges, small tan head forms, some lace spots. Smell is awesome, very malty, toffee/chocolate and tons of coffee aroma, very raw and very powerful. Taste is malty and choclate/toffee notes are in the front, followed by a big coffee roast hit, lots of coffee in the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low carbonation. I really enjoyed this, better on cask than in bottle, and I understand this was the first time DDC has ever done Peche Mortel on cask! 627 charactersViggo, Nov 06, 2006

Appearance was a black, even held up to light, with a small dark brown head that dissolved into a ring of brown bubbles. Aroma of black coffee, dark chocolate. Taste was like chocolate-covered espresso beans, very complex and warming and got better with each sip. This was the smoothest beer I have tried, silky and thick and the high ABV is almost inperceptable. Wow... So glad I tried this, best beer Canada makes IMHO. 484 characterstatterdash, Oct 23, 2006

Just exceptional appearance, black body with a dark brown head that persists, beautiful. Smells of roasted coffee. Taste, well let's just say it hits with a bang, what flavor! Very rich espresso flavor with a hint of caramel. One of the best tasting beers I've ever had. Mouth feel is medium bodied with light carbonation, very smooth. I found this beer quite drinkable despite the richness and high alcohol. It didn't take long to go through 2 glasses along with a nice cheese plate of assorted Quebec cheeses. I highly recommend this beer. 589 charactersstangelj, Oct 15, 2006
4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz. bottle at The Map Room in Chicago. Bottled 11/04 according to the label. What a beer and what a bar! The translation of the name means "Mortal Sin" -- well, forgive me Father, for I have sinned, liked it, and will do it again if given the chance. 
Eased slowly out of the bottle and curled up in my glass. Opaque, black fluid, with just the faintest hints of ruby/mahogany at the edges where the light peeks through. Topped with a medium size, light brown head. 
Aroma is coffee - big surprise - paired up with chocolate. Alcohol says hello, and rather loudly at that. As I keep sniffing, a dark fruit - port like character is found lurking in the background. No real hop presence is picked up in the scent.
Flavor is coffee, then coffee, then some more coffee....Did I mention that you taste coffee? After a few sips, I started picking up other flavors such as bittersweet chocolate and mocha. As it warmed, the dark fruits (black cherry, raisins) picked up more, especially in the middle. Equally important was what was lacking - alcohol was fairly well hidden, despite coming across strongly in the aroma. The finish finally brought some hops and a little bit of pepper.
This was a medium to full bodied beer. The carbonation was quite assertive, and helped pick up the beer and move it along. Texture was creamy/thick/chewy. Alcohol warming kicked in about 1/4 through the bottle. Finally, the finish was dry rather than sweet.
A fantastic beer. I am a big coffee fan, so that probably helped. If you don't like coffee, this beer may not work that well for you. It is pricey ($20) and hard to find, but I would still encourage a try, though, as there are so many other things going on in it. Another one of those "How am I going to get some more" beers. 1,778 characters, Oct 09, 2006

This beer has a robust coffee aroma. It has a slight chocolate aroma also. It has a sweet malty aroma. Some licorice is also subtly present.
This beer tastes exactly like it smells. Coffee up front. Behind that, chocolate, and licorice mix in. It has a nice roasted malt, sweet flavor as well.
This beer is very thick. It goes duwn quite smooth, leaving a strong coffee aftertaste. It is low in carbonation, suiting the style perfectly.
I dont think this beer would be the best session beer. It is high in alcohol, and it is quite agressive. 
Overall: This beer is great. It is exactly what I expected. Thank you Himerman for this great beer. 778 charactersOStrungT, Sep 29, 2006
4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4If you plot rarity against price, this beer is far into the upper right quadrant. I paid $18.99 for a 1pt 6.3oz bottle in Chicago (Dobby's in Palatine). I'd never seen it on sale anywhere else yet, so I coughed up the money to try it. The bottle was date stamped Aug 2005, one year before I bought it.
Based on appearance alone this is a top shelf stout, jet black liquid even when I put a light behind the glass. The foam is frothy and thick and fairly light colored considering how dark the beer is.
The smell is coffee stout, actually identical to Founders Breakfast Stout based on recent memory (I had a bottle 1 week ago). The taste's also very similar to Breakfast Stout, but maybe a little stronger coffee flavor in Peche Mortel. The PM bottle states ingredients as "malt, fair trade cofee, hops, water, yeast", and I assume Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel adds more actual coffee than Founders. The after-taste is more bitter than sweet, I'm guessing due to coffee more than hops. I can guess some chocolate into the flavor too.
Mouthfeel is on the thick side and matches the flavor well. Drinkability is pretty good but a little difficult for me to rate too high since a little of the flavor goes a long way.
My opinion: Peche Mortel is a great beer, maybe best of its under-represented style, but nowhere near worth its price. 1,339 charactersTurdFurgison, Sep 04, 2006
4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours a very dark brown, seems somewhat thin. Appears to have low carbonation until a decent head is conjured out of no where. Made up of medium sized dark beige bubbles, the head is falling but leaving a great ring around the glass.
S: Wow. Massive loads of deep roasted coffee. Memories of charred campfire wood. There's also some tobacco, slight vanilla and marshmallow.
T: Immediate strong roasted grains. Then the coffee comes, big and strong. The coffee is not sharp or pungent, not too roasted or too watery, just very rounded and quite superb really. Massive mocha undertones play the second fiddle in this symphony. They move from bitter sweet to creamy milk chocolate and finishes lingering dried cocoa. Some minor notes of butterscotch, molasses and graham. Slight alcohol in the nose, ever so slightly. 
M: Full body, bit fuzzy. 
D: Not a lot of bad things to say about this beer. Carbonation could be a touch smoother and the head could be a bit bigger. The beer itself is delicious. Highly recommended. 1,031 charactersWestsidethreat, Aug 19, 2006
4.73/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the source, poured into a tulip glass.
Appearance: Pitch black with a frothy, cappucino-like head that stuck around to the last drop. Just a gorgeous-looking stout.
Smell: Like a bag of fresh coffee beans.
Taste and mouthfeel: Wow. Like a iced espresso with an infusion of dark chocolate, which tempered the intense bitterness an espresso can have a bit. The bitterness was more akin to a truffle liqueur. Intensely flavored, but not so much that it numbs your palate, and the flavor lasts throughout. Finished surprisingly dry, with only a vague hint of smoke. Mouthfeel was creamy at the start and went down silky smooth - just enough carbonation to let you know it's there.
Drinkability: Where was the 9.5 ABV? Seriously. For a sipping beer, I was sippng pretty fast and felt no ill effects afterward. Only thing holding this one back is availability.
Notes: Damn, this beer is gonna haunt me. So good that I went back to have it again the next night, but they were out of it. Searched for bottles before I left town, but came up empty. Not only one of the best stouts I've had, but one of the best beers I've had. 1,142 charactersbklynbeerbaron, Aug 15, 2006
4.68/5  rDev +6.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served in a pub glass. Pours a deep black with large creamy beige head that thins out quickly, but the remainder lasts until the last drop. Full bodied, light to mod carbonation.
Smells of strongly roasted coffee, spicy alcohol, and a lighter oaky-smokiness. 
Tastes strongly of coffee, bitter, but not overroasted. Sweet caramel maltiness and a lighter chocolate backfinish. The alcohol quite loud in its presence, especially on the back finish. When I have drank this in the past, I recall the alcohol and hops blending more with the overall taste. I don't know if this is because this is a May 2004 bottle, or if my tastes have changed since I've had this last. This is not as good as I remember, the hops have lessened; the alcohol has taken over the supreme espresso/coffee maltiness. 
Very nice mouthfeel, full mouthfeel, light oiliness that adds to the drinkability and breaks up some of the alcohol. Still dangerously drinkable. 945 characterslaintringulis, Aug 14, 2006

Appearance: Absolutely pitch black, big tan fizzy head lingers a while. Lacing is very sticky.
Smell: Rip roarin' raw coffee, also some toasted coconut, sweet cream, and alcohol vapors. Wow, never encountered a beer that smells like this, very inviting and interesting.
Taste: What is this beer? I have never had anything wuite like it, very delicious, smooth, and enjoyable. The creamy sweet flavors are balanced well by the bitter coffee. The whole flavor is very well rounded and delicious. Fantastic.
Drinkability: A little different and more dessert-like than many beers in the style, the whole thing is silky smooth and well crafted. You have made a very good ber Dieu Du Ciel. Too bad you charge an arm and a leg for this stuff. 788 charactersTastyTaste, Jul 13, 2006
4.27/5  rDev -3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 22oz bomber. I bought this beer because some Chi BA's wouldn't shut up about this beer when the Map Room had it on tap. Plus at either Sam's, Binny's, Sal's were all $19.99 a bottle. But I eventually broe down and bought one and was glad I did. The bottled on date was August 2005. So almost a year old.
Appearance- Pours a viscous motor oil black brown with hardly any liught penetration when held directly to the light. All that was noted were some lighter brown highlights around the top edges of the beer. The head was a decent one and a half finger head with a slowly disappearing foam after each sip. 
Smell- When it was at its coldest, the coffee aroma was the strongest. But as it warmed up the coffee bean aroma mixed with a creamy, roasted malt and noticeable hops. 
Taste- Starts out with a true coffee bean flavor mixed with a dash of vannillin zucker. But an almost black coffee flavor! Just how I always take my coffee. As the beer warms, more roasted malt flavors stick out with more chocolate and rye hop flavors. 
Mouthfeel- Good and creamy and malty. Inky, oily and silky all at different intervals. I wouldn't recommend having this beer with anything. Just drinki the whole glass by itself and then eat myabe a chocolatey dessert. 1,275 charactersscruffwhor, Jun 27, 2006
4.73/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle; served in a Delirium Tremens glass.
Awesome black pour with a very generous head that is almost chocolate in smell and dark tan in color. Wonderful smell and bittersweet taste at the opening.
Incredible lacing on the glass, very sticky head and frothy like a cappuccino - quite nice. Taste is intense coffee and large notes of chocolate and mild bitterness followed by strong bitterness. Hops barely present, unless they used coffee as their hops. This is truly an excellent stout.
Overall  strong coffee tastes, with a wild chocolate aroma that comes through as a dark/bittersweet flavor. This is a bit hard to drink a lot of; especially without food as it is intense and very sweet. However, this would compliment a nice dessert or be a great after dinner beer to enjoy.
I would strongly advice coffee/stout drinkers alike to look beyond the price and give this a shot. I think this is outstanding and look forward to having another one in the near future. This does have a ridiculous amount of coffee flavor - and when you are in the mood for a nice dark chocolate/coffee stout - this is flawless.
Cheers. 1,138 charactersHimerMan, Jun 19, 2006
4.19/5  rDev -4.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A dark brown/black beer. Has a nice foamy brown head. It smells like chocolate covered coffee beans. There is also an earthy malt note in the background. The chocolate coffee bean character continues in the taste with the coffee taking full control at the swallow. If you have ever eaten a chocolate covered esspresso bean then this comes mighty close. Especially with that coffee flavor that sits at the back of your throat long after you are done. 449 charactersybnorml, Jun 07, 2006
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Obscurant obsidian. The coffee-with-cream colored crown is Belgianesque in size and texture and fills the majority of the glass immediately after a gentle pour. I love the thickly creamy, yet airy, melted nature of the foam as it slowly deflates. This may be the single best looking head on any stout... ever. Thick, chunky hunks of lace stick to most of the available glassy surface. An astounding appearance.
Keeping in mind that I haven't had a huge number of coffee-added ales, this one may be the most powerfully aromatic coffee beer in existence. In fact, it smells exactly like freshly ground coffee beans, not beer. On further assessment, there's an intense bittersweet chocolatiness as well. This is a no nonsense, no apologies, in your face aroma. If I was a coffee lover, it'd be perfect.
Javalaaanche!!! Mon Dieu! As above, I can't imagine any beer on planet Earth that tastes more like iced (cool actually) coffee than Peche Mortel. I'm not sure if Canadians are required to list ingredients from most abundant to least, like Americans are, but I find it interesting that Fair-Trade coffee comes before water on the label.
I don't mind coffee stouts at all, as long as the flavor of the beans is complementary to the beer as a whole. This one though, is so all encompassingly coffeeish that I'm struggling to figure out how I feel about it as beer. Again, if you're a java junkie, you'll be in seventh heaven. If not, like me, you'll be less than thrilled.
As the middle portion of the bomber approaches, I'm able to re-route the raging coffee river just enough to appreciate small tributaries of roasted black malt and bittersweet chocolate. However, it's like trying to filter out a nearby jackhammer enough to appreciate a Mozart concerto at low volume. Hard to do, but worth the effort.
In the final reckoning, I can appreciate this beer for the masterpiece it is. Having said that, Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel may have overdone it with the coffee and effectively obliterated the beerness of the beer. No alcohol is appreciated on the palate and very little is making its way to my brain. Actually, what's happening is that the undoubtedly sky-high amount of caffeine is counteracting the depressant effect of the alcohol. It's an interesting effect that is becoming more interesting as the ounces fly by.
The body/mouthfeel is first-class all the way. I've had bigger, thicker, creamier, more viscous stouts, but this one does a great job in every one of those areas. The aural evidence of a highly carbonated beer (at crown cracking) and the visual evidence (on the pour) are not borne out in the mouth.
I find it interesting (and ironic) that a brewery named 'God of Heaven' brews a double stout called 'Mortal Sin'. Peche Mortel could use a little of that tension, a little of that fascinating dichotomy, instead of being a steamroller of a coffee beer that doesn't allow complexity to flourish and, therefore, ends up being one-dimensional. For the millionth time... if you love coffee as much as you love beer, then Peche Mortel should be at the top of your wish list. 3,093 charactersBuckeyeNation, Jun 05, 2006

Poured an opaque black color with a thick brown head. Smell is roasty and coffee. Taste follows suit with a creamy double espresso taste and texture. Wow. This is the best coffee stout I have ever had bar none. Seems like a ton of Cafra malt? Coffee beans? Whatever it is, I want to switch my regular coffee to this just dont think my boss would enjoy that. You would never know this is 9% ABV until the tingle at the end of the 22ozer. Worth the price. 496 characterssacfly, May 29, 2006

This is one of the best beer I ever had. You gotta love Dieu Du Ciel in Montreal for making this fine example of a coffee stout. Alcohol level is high but doesn't over power the smell and taste of the beer. Any one who loves beer and coffee needs to try this beer. Only draw back is that it is very hard to find.

Pours a very deep dark brown and makes a huge rocky tan head. Its close to, but not quite black.
Aroma is pure coffee, open a fresh bag of beans and this is what you have. There's some nice cocoa undertones too, but mostly fresh roasted coffee.
And the flavor is really all about coffee, its fortunate that I don't mind a nice cup of joe every now and again. Rich deep roasted espresso, dark bittersweet chocolate, light sweetness. Very well balanced, smooth bitterness that I think comes more from the bean than the hop. Offers up nice malty complexity all around.
Crisp and heavily carbonated, medium to full body and finishes with a spicy dry finish. It drinks like a belgian. This is a really nice quality that is uncommon to most double stouts, no thick viscosity here, just clean and dry... I'm really curious what the FG is. If I had to guess, I'd call it 1.010ish. Fantastic!
This is way too easy to drink, the 9% alcohol is nearly invisible. I love this beer. I gotta find a way to trade for some more! 1,044 characterskmcnair, May 24, 2006

3.93/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5This beer was a very dark brown, clear offering that produced a 3 finger tan head when poured into my pint glass. It was enjoyed during a viewing of the extended version of "The Fellowship of the Ring", and it complimented the movie well.
The aroma was dark roasted malt, coffee, and slightly sweet, with a light hint of dark fruits. Complex.
Taste was of very dark roasted malt, bitter roasted coffee beans, and a little bit of hop bitterness. I expected a bit more in the way of coffee richness. What I detected could have come from the malt itself without addition of coffee beans to the brew.
Mouthfeel was pretty good, about as chewy as expected... but a little too bitter and mouth-puckering.
Drinkability... not bad for a double stout, but the price knocks it down a bit. I am glad I had it, since it is my goal to try as many of the top 100 (and worst 100 as well)... but I don't think it was worth $15.99. I thought Speedway Stout was better. 963 charactersconnecticutpoet, Mar 27, 2006

Worked as the clear winner, on cask at Volo cafe in fall 2006 and that is my ranking. Coffee aroma, and thick chocolate coffee was superb.

The aroma definitely has coffee in it. A bit of a smokiness to the nose also. The taste is definitely coffee, with some of the smokiness in there also.

Pours a midnight black with some red highlights and a light tan head with some sticky lace.
Aroma of cracked coffee bean, chocolate, caramel, roasted barley. Really beautiful nose.
Flavor is coffee/espresso shot upfront with a layer of bitter chocolate and an astringent bittering on the finish.
Mouthfeel starts really rich and lush but seems to fade away a bit. A tad disappointing and doesn't match nose or flavor.
Drinkability is solid but not as varied and palate coating as I would have expected with the nose this gives off. Sort of unfair but minorly disappointing to be honest. 604 charactersCRJMellor, Feb 20, 2006
4.12/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Picked up this bomber a little while back while visiting Charlotte and making a stop at Brawleys. This is the last of a series of Coffee flavored Stouts I have run into lately. The beer poured out dark and opaque like a Stout should. The color was not quite completely black, and showed a bit of red at the edges when held up against the light. The head was two finger tall, creamy, and displayed excellent stability and longevity.
There was no mistaking the presence of coffee while smelling the beer. The dark espresso roast smell came out quite clearly and beautifully. There was also some floral hoppiness coming through in the aroma.
The taste was dry, roasty, and decadent. Dark bitter coffee was certainly in the forefront, followed by bittersweet chocolate, sticky toffee, and finishing up with grape skin. The alcohol was very warming, but not overly pungent. Mouthfeel stayed dry and got a little grainy at the end of each sip.
This was certainly not as easy to drink as Founders Breakfast Stout, or my local favorite Terrapin Wake and Bake. Unlike those beers, this was missing the rounded oat texture. Without that aspect, it felt slightly harsher and edgier. 1,184 charactersrajendra82, Feb 16, 2006
4.46/5  rDev +1.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into my DFH Raison D'Etre long-stemmed oversized goblet.
Poured a coal-black with a hint of burgundy on the far reaches of the glass when held up to the light. Nice 3/4" finger of beige head with decent resilancy. Faded to a nice layer of foam surrounded by thick lace.
Aroma of dark bakers chocolate and espresso beans and rum raison ice cream. Mildly hoppy, but the hops can't compete with the malt in this baby.
Now for the good stuff. Wow. Bitter coffee from the very start. Dark bittersweet chocolate malt layered with unsweetened coffee and a solid hoppy bite. Very well balanced though. Carbonation is really up there. Quite the amalgam of hoppy and malty, chocolate and coffee. The creamyness just takes over your whole mouth. Silky smooth and quite tongue coating. It's like drinking a molten chocolate cake with coffee icing. 
Finishes a bit dry, thick and rather bitter. Kinda like an asparin stayed in your mouth a bit too long. But in a good way. Trust me. 
Beautifully done. I'm glad I have 1 more of these in the cellar. We'll see how it reviews a year from now. If I can forget about it for that long. 1,131 charactersBrewfan, Feb 09, 2006
4.92/5  rDev +11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I've had this beer sitting down in the cellar for about 4 months and its about time I tried it. Poured fast into a pint glass with a light foamy head that dissipated quickly. Three was not a shred of light getting through this beer...black as night. Smell was intense with coffee aromas dominating and hints of chocolate, espresso and whiskey hiding in there somewhere. The coffee was even stronger upon tasting...similar to Founder's Breakfast Stout except with more coffee if you can imagine that. Not cheap instant coffee mind you, but intoxicating Columbian coffee that will leave its presence with you for a while after finishing. As it warmed up a bit, some of the chocolate characters really made themselves known, offsetting the coffee ever so slightly. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and a tad lighter then I had anticipated, but the big flavors made up for it completely. One of my favorite things about this beer was the 9% alcohol...not weak by any means, but strong enough to make its presence known. Me being somebody who enjoys a good cup of coffee, I could drink this beer often without feeling too intimidated by the big tastes. Final verdict is that this is an exceptional beer. It might not appeal so much to people who don't like a cup o joe every now and again, but even so, its still a beer that is worth sampling for the complexities alone. It may be a bit pricy if you find it in your area at $16, but I can say that I'de pick it up again and save it for a special occasion. It is unique, rich, interesting and damn tasty. Anyway im gonna stop reviewing and get back to drinkin. Try, Try, Try 1,613 charactersjamie2dope, Feb 08, 2006
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I'm finally getting around to popping the cap on this quite hyped brew from Canada. It pours from the bottle a deep, oily midnight black with a bubbly, frothy creamy two fingers of tan head atop the brew. I can already smell dark, roasty coffee before my nose ever gets near the glass. No light dares to escape this brew. Aromas begin with full force rich, dark espresso exploding all over the place. Lots of roasty chocolate and burnt notes as well. Reminds me of a fresh box of chocolate covered espresso beans in liquid form. A slight note of creaminess here, but the coffee is the centerpiece of the brew.
First sip brings rich, dark, roasted and slightly burnt maltiness with plenty of creamy chocolate flavor and a bold wall of espresso that envelopes the palate. Fairly sweet with a drizzle of caramel and a bit creamy this goes down with a nice lingering roasted coffee bitterness and flavor. Probably the most coffee forward stout I have yet to consume...if you enjoy coffee I can't see not enjoying this brew.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy with a good steady carbonation. It's a touch lighter than I expected but still definetly makes its presence known. It's very enjoyable to sit down to a bottle of this...but I think one would be enough in a sitting. Rich, decadant and a sure bet for any coffee stout lover. Thanks to Shelton and Dieu Du Ciel for bringing this to the USA and into my beer loving hands, even though the high price will keep it out of my hands most of the time. Guess it's time for a trip up north! 1,542 charactersorbitalr0x, Jan 22, 2006

Inky black pour sets fourth a billowy 2 fingers of espresso crema froth that retains like a champ and encrusts my goblet on thick lace.
Aroma shows dark roasted and chocolate malts, a massive coffee presence, some scorched sugar notes, and a nudge of pine and floral hops.
Flavor is all about the coffee, and shadowed by cocoa, toffee, toasted grain, bittersweet baking chocolate, with some nondescript hops in the finish. The coffee bitterness colides with the hops to create a real tongue puckering experience.
Body is between medium and large, I was expecting huge. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with minimal carbonation and a dry mouthfeel. Good, but for the price I was expecting something that would blow me away. This did not. 795 charactersAlexJ, Jan 10, 2006

A: Jet black with a fluffy white head. Great lacing. Honestly one of the prettiest beers I have ever seen.
N: Dark, roasted espresso that just went down to BALCO for a little pick me up.
T: It's true. I really think you have to like coffee to enjoy this brew. Luckily, I am a coffee lover. It is like strong, dark, italian coffee. No milk, no sugar, no wimps. Suck it up and suck it down - grow some hair on your chest. It's an intense flavor, but not like Arrogant Bastard or anything like that - just good ol' fashioned folgers...only good. 
M: Medium body - fluffy because of the head. Good carbonation. Not syrupy at all.
D: I could pound a few of these away (if i was Warren Buffet). Expensive, but damn drinkable. 
I have one more of these and I can't wait to drink it. We will see what happens with that one. 845 charactersLnedrive14, Jan 03, 2006
4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The beer poured into the glass black with a brown highlight when held to light. The head was brown, make that dark brown and low, but lasting enough to make an attempt to lace the glass.
The aroma was strong expresso coffee and chocolate. The aroma reminded me of a chocolate covered expresso bean. The aroma was roasty with some fruity aspects and just some light wafts of alcohol. There was also present a bit of caramel and some dark fruits.
The flavor was coffee, plain and simple. This was expresso in a bottle. The beer was also roasty with a substantial amount of bittering hiding behind the coffee and chocolate presence. The flavor contained a fruity aspect along with some caramel thrown in for good measure.
The finish was even with a lingering bitterness from hops, grains and coffee long and pleasant into the aftertaste. The body was just full, but not chewy. The aroma and taste of coffee rule this beer and make for a highly drinkable beverage. Alcohol was only present in warming after consumption and in a slight amount in the aroma. A very nice beer. Dunno if it was worth the coin, but considering how difficult this was to obtain, certainly worth giving it a whirl. 
22 ounce bottle. Bottled on 8/05. Purchased at Brawley's. 1,257 charactersGCBrewingCo, Dec 31, 2005

The aroma is a great mix of malt, with chocolate and roasted notes mixing with epressso notes. there is also just a hint of sweet brown sugar too. 
Overall quite enticing nose!
First sip reveals a silky smooth body and very fine carbonation that still tingles my palate as I sip. 
The flavor is similar to the nose with roasted malt, some chocolate and brown sugar too. The espresso is large and in charge with some slight bitterness coming through on the end of each sip. The coffee notes linger on my palate long after each sip.
The beer is dangerously easy to drink with no hint of ABV anywhere to be found. Quite a well crafted brew. 851 characterssulldaddy, Dec 22, 2005
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer was poured into a wide mouth goblet.
Appearance: This beer is black. There is no opaqueness to light a total black hole. The head was coffee colored with a touch of creame. The head was briefly there and was gone. There was speckles of lacing left behind on the glass.
Smell: Coffee almost says it all about the smell. This is the mother of all dark roasted espresso treats. Juan Valdez himself could not have crammed more coffee smell into this beer. There is a trace of chocolate and vanilla lost in the coffee.
Taste: This is the very essence of dark roasted espresso crammed into a beer. There is a small amount of sweet coffee and vanilla present in the taste. A very roasty toasty beer. 
Mouthfeel: This is a meduim bodied beer. The taste is very thick and chewy. 
Drinkability: Just an excellent coffee beer. Very drinkable not to sweet and not to hoppy. Just perfection in a beer bottle. 919 charactersnlmartin, Dec 21, 2005
4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottled August 2005.
Pours out jet black with brown edges that let just a tiny bit of light through. Generous tan head that fades extremely slowly and leaves a nice amount of lacing. Lively bubbles still dancing in it an hour or so after initial pour. 
Smell is sharp, strong coffee of the French roast/espresso variety, with a light roasted malt and powdered cocoa scent underneath for good measure. 
Flavor is completely unique and will make me think twice about assigning "coffee flavors" to any other stout. Yes, the coffee jumps right to the front of the tongue and runs around, but it's not at all like drinking a cup of coffee. Instead, it's like drinking, say, a mocha or a latte, but with beer instead of milk. The roasted malt notes stand up surprisingly well to the heft of the coffee, and a little bit of creamy vanilla even works its way in there. Intense, but well-rounded. 
Mouthfeel is perfectly creamy and just right for this one.
Overall: A great, great stout that uses the coffee flavors creatively and daringly. Worth the 23 bucks I paid for it? Well, probably not, but it's an interesting taste to try once. I'd try it again at a reasonable price. 1,183 characterswhartontallboy, Dec 21, 2005

The beer pours dark brown/ black with a big tan head but what really stirs the senses is the strong nose of coffee followed by rich dark chocolate. The first taste follows the coffee/ chocolate theme with complexity and smoothness combined in a marriage parfait. Truly one of Canada's best beers and a benchmark for coffee stouts. 365 characterscanucklehead, Dec 18, 2005
4.12/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4(Served in a snifter)
A- This beer pours a dark inky opaque black body with a thick dark tan head of foam. There are lots of bubbles pooling under the foam at the edges of the glass. 
S- The smell of cold coffee with a faint banana hint is strong in the nose. Notes of coffee beans and dark chocolate nibs come through in the finish. There is an earthiness in the coffee aroma aswell. 
T- The initial coffee taste is that of cold coffee grounds with the finish of a light tangy note. The coffee taste has a slight plastic hint to it that is a bit off. As it warms the nice deep roasted coffee starts to come out in the finish. 
M- This beer has a medium mouthfeel with a good bit of fizz on the tongue and a creamy texture. No astringency or alcohol warmth. 
D- This is a unique beer it has many different coffee flavors some off and some very nice. I couldn't taste any of the grains and hops that would have really giving a nice compliment or balance to the coffee. 982 charactersrhoadsrage, Dec 17, 2005

OK, let me say from the get-go that I am not a coffee drinker. I dont much care for the taste, and Ive learned to tolerate its aromaand even enjoy it on occasion. But, fear notI will review this beer for what it is, an Imperial Coffee Stout. I just hope I can get some sleep tonight with a bomber-full of Fair Trade Coffee coursing through my veins. 
The pour is just beautimuseverything an imperial stout should be: deep rich cocoa color, with a tight brown head that wants to hang around a while managing to stay out of the way. The aroma is dark roasted malt and coffee. Very nice and invitinga coffee aroma I could wake up to every day. I prepared myself for an onslaught of sharp coffee flavor, but, much to my surprise, I got more of a velvety creamy mocha-malty burnt fullness up front with an edge of dark Belgian chocolate that is just damn good. Then, it hits methe coffee finish is long and strong, adding to the drinkability in the sense that I want to another sip as a palate cleanser. But, as you can imagine, that creates a viscous cycle. Alcohol makes itself known, but not too much.
Damn, this must be a coffee-lovers wet dream of a beer. While I give the beer very high marks, it will not cross my lips againthough Dieu Du Ciel clearly nailed this one, it is just too much coffee for this reviewer. Maybe Ill take the 2nd half of this bomber and mix it with some Rogue Chocolate Stout so see what shakes outbut then again, why ruin a perfectly good Rogue?
And by the freakin way, this beer just destroys the palate for the next beer.
&lt;30 minutes later&gt; In-fuckin-tense coffee finish lingers on...
Cheers 1,728 charactersmarkman, Dec 17, 2005
4.72/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottled on date of 8/05. Pours out a thick opaque black with a nice sized velvety tan cap of foam. Some streaky lace was left around the glass as this was consumed. HUGE roasted coffee bean and espresso aroma more so than any other coffee beer I have had. Lingering underneath the giant coffee scent was some dark chocolate notes add a nice sweetness to all the coffee bitter. Taste follows suite with a big coffee punch with plenty of roasted malts and a good bit of bittersweet dark chocolate. This is definitely all about the coffee and while it may seem over the top it was never too much. Dry roasted espresso finish. Nice solid body that carries the big flavor very well and stays smooth. Pretty damn drinkable considering how powerful the coffee comes on. Great stuff especially if you like coffee. 805 charactersmeathookjones, Dec 08, 2005

4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Well, I couldn't hold off on cellaring the other bottle... This beer is that good. 
My second review of this beer. This time around, the mouthfeel is not as surreal, and the drinkability seems to be a bit more demure. The nose is taken aback with a remarkable fresh roasted coffee aroma. Still, this is the best beer Ive had in a very long time. 
There is an aura surrounding this beer - the name, the rarity, the Picasso inspired label... 
A slow-sipper for sure. This is not a beer to drink on an empty stomach. 522 characterspalma, Dec 01, 2005
4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5So, here we go, the unattainable maiden is at my command at last! I like the label art. If this is "mortal sin", then is the woman with the snake in the picture Eve after the fall? Is that why she not naked? And how could a coffee stout be sinful? Why, they're heaven on Earth to me!
But, I ramble...less thinking, more drinking, starting...now...
Decadent black sheathing, not a trace of light shining through....a solid crown of fluffy brown foam stands guard, like a mochaccino cap. Very nice.
Ahhh!!! Aroma reeks from the start withcocoa and espresso, riddled with earthy, bittersweet tones, redolent of richest chocolate, turning soft and creamy...very, very nice. I could smell this all day, etcetera, etcetera...
Over the lips and in the mouth, it's beauty, indeed. Fills the entire orifice, and seeps into all the cracks and corners, spilling this dark deliciousness far and wide, reverberating long after the liquid has slipped down the throat. All those flavors in the nose resound and rebound, roasty malts and tingly hops conspire to create an exquisite sensation on the tastebuds. Though fully flavored, it's never overbearing or unapproachable...though, clearly, enemies of stouts or coffee are urged to stay far away from the contents.
This is a sly and sophisticated thing, the 9% hiding well, the flavors resting happily, comfortably on the palate, long and wide. A beatiful beer, an excellent indulgence. And a rare one, as well. 
Though, on reflection, the $16.59 I paid for this bomber could have got me a 6-pack of Bell's Batch 7K. The price, and rarity, remains the only drawback I can think of, but I remain glad to have tasted it at last!
and, happily, this is a sipper, which means I get to enjoy it longer than other beers that slip down the gullet with more ease. I just might be set for the night. 1,844 charactersfeloniousmonk, Dec 01, 2005

On my visit to the famous Chicago bar, they just recently got this in on-tap, so I had to try it. Pours very dark brown with a thin tan head. Smells exactly like espresso with an alcoholic twinge. The coffee-ish aromas are so abundant in this beer that it's very hard to pick up anything else..if there even is anything else. 
Tastes are smooth and creamy coffee flavors with hints of nuts and maybe a bit of lingering hop bitterness (however, maybe it was just the bitter coffee flavors). The bartender said there was caffeine in it as well..which didn't surprise me a bit, considering it reminded me of coffee in pretty much every other way. 
It was nice to try on-tap without having to drop $17+ on a bottle. A coffee lover's dream.. and would be a fantastic dessert beer as well. 838 charactershero27, Nov 27, 2005
4.17/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4My dessert pairing on this thanksgiving night. Pours straight black with a thick creamy tan head. Aroma is pure espresso and anise, and it's strooong. The alcohol doesn't hide either; present mildly in the nose and moreso in the taste, showing itself throughout, into the finish and warming in the aftertaste. Flavor shows off notes of dry roasted cocoa and a huge wallop of bitter Italian coffee beans. Blackened espresso. Yow. There's a lingering hop bitterness, but the coffee/espresso flavor brings all the bitterness you'll need. Sharp astringency on the tongue leads to a creamy smoothness that gradually thins out. This is very good; however now that I've had it I do think it is quite overhyped, and way too pricey. 723 charactersIrishRedRock, Nov 25, 2005
3.98/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 422 oz bottle dated 8/05. Pours an opaque dark brown with a thin tan head that quickly goes to a thin collar that leaves a touch of lacing.
The aroma is mostly roasted coffee with a little chocolate and vanilla and lactose. Some slight sour notes pop up every once in a while.
The flavor is a whole lot of roasted coffee as well with some chocolatey malts and lactose in the background - kind of oakey. It's pretty sweet but the coffee helps balance it - not much bitterness though. The alcohol is very well hidden. As it warms, the sweet dessert notes blossom. The mouthfeel is full and very smooth with low carbonation.
Overall, an interesting coffee stout (my first). It seems pretty one dimensional to me (all coffee), but it is enjoyable and decadent. 764 charactersBeaver13, Nov 24, 2005

pitch black. with a thin creamy tan head that never really goes away and leaves some frosty lacing
there's a malty sweetness upfront, that quickly gives way to the coffee character. little to no hop presence to allow the cofffee and roasty mocha to come through, except for the nice bitterness at the end
incredibly smooth. oh man. a fantastic creamy mouthfeel; not thick, but i feel like i just took a sip of baby's butt. and the tactful bitterness prolongs the whole experience. until now i thought impy stouts (or double stouts or whatever) were oblivious to subtlety and balance

3.78/5  rDev -14.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Bottle Batch #2, Sampled November 2005
Pours with a frothy, three-finger thick light brown head that sits atop a rich black hue. As I pour the beer I get a rich note of burnt fruit. Up front the burnt fruit notes of raisin and prune are evident, but quickly the nose is dominated by the a strong burnt roast character that is reminiscent of black coffee and roast barley. There is also quite a bit of burnt grain husks; sharp, slightly acidic, and a bit tannic.
The taste is immediately rich and full in the mouth, though not intensely so. The beer has a sweet malt character that coupled with the roast character makes me think of a sweetened black coffee, or even better a mocha that is heavy on the espresso. The finish is quite long, it loses its richness though, it is strong on a burnt acidity, almost with an acrid burnt note that lends a certain burnt bitterness to the finish. The finish definitely makes one want to take another sip of this beer. Up front and through to the middle, this beer is rich and well matched between the mouth coating sweet malt character, the over the top roast barley & coffee notes, and rich dark chocolate flavors. The finish though is a bit too acrid, and the malt notes die off way to fast, if it lingered a bit more this beer would have a much better finish.
Don't get me wrong this is quite an enjoyable beer, for the most part; The finish really is a bit too harsh, and the nose has a bit of the harsh notes as well. I wish that all of this beer had the balance and richness that is found up front in the taste. 1,563 charactersGueuzedude, Nov 16, 2005

Appearance: A dense brown/black pour with cola edging. A tighly carbonated off white head develops.
Smell: PURE coffee. One of the most pronounced coffee aromas I've ever noted. Like sniffing pure espresso grindings. I can't detect anything on the nose other than pure espresso.
Taste: Like drinking pure espresso. A touch of cream and a strong roasty finish (contrasts nicely with the bitterness of the initial tasting). Pure coffee goodness throughout. A long lingering and slight cocoa finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied to full with that long cocoa finish (wonderful).
Drinkability: One of the best stouts I've ever had. I have to qualify this...if you aren't a coffee lover, don't even bother with this one. I've loved my coffee a lot longer than my beer so for me, it was the perfect marriage. I could drink this all day, every day. But I would never offer this up to someone that didn't like coffee. 
World Class in my book. 1,106 charactersmattcrill, Nov 06, 2005
4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I was surprised as hell to see this at my store. I had to pick it up even despite the steep price of $17 per bomber. This beer has definitely lived up to the hype.
Pours to a pitch black color that seems to absorb all light around it, topped by a huge chocolatey pillow of head that continues to grow for a while after the pour. Sounds like a bowl of Rice Krispees as it pours into the glass. Leaves curtains of thick stratafied lacing that looks like some type of hieroglyph afterwards.
The smell is very dark chocolatey with some bitter french roast and hazelnut aroma. Very bold coffee bouqet, along with some undertones of caramel, butterscotch, and toffee. Quite stunning. I would have hoped for maybe a little bit of hop undertones to further separate this beer from a cold cup of joe, but the brewers have absolutely nailed their mark.
The taste is very good. Has a nice semi-sweet chocolate malt flavor to it with a hugely bitter dry roast coffee flavor. Definitely french roast with hazelnut. It could just be wishful thinking, but I think I might even taste some hops far, far, far below the huge coffee flavor. Very smooth with some oaky vanilla flavors to it as well.
The body is a bit thinner than I was expecting, but the mouthfeel is still quite excellent. Very smooth and creamy, but not quite thick and chewy. Quite crisply carbonated as well.
Drinkability is good for this massive coffee imperial stout, but there is only so much of an assault my tastebuds can handle after a while. It even seems to give me a bit of a caffeine jolt. If you are a coffee lover, you absolutely must seek this beer out. If you don't like coffee, there is still hope. Hell, I can't stand the stuff [coffee], but for some reason I absolutely love coffee stouts. If only I could force carbonate coffee and serve it slightly chilled I might be on to something...
edit: after drinking more of this beer, it was an absolute must to increase my ratings. This is probably my favorite beer at the moment, but it's a shame that I bought and drank the last bottle in stock (and probably the last we'll see at John's Grocery for quite some time). 2,151 charactersneonbrown82, Oct 28, 2005
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4First off, I love coffee and always drink it black. That's good, because this beer was pitch black too.
I thought Peche Mortel was kick ass. The rich coffee and espresso flavors were complemented by hints of chocolate and nuts. The aftertaste was nicely sweet. Sure, it's a sipping beer, but it's still pretty drinkable. I didn't experience the overwhelming aftertaste or flavors of ashtrays and so on that others mentioned. 
The mouthfeel was actually a little on the thin side. In many cases, that might detract from the beer, but in this case, I think it helped make the beer smoother and easier to drink.
NOTE: This was the batch released in October 2005. I'm not sure how the various batches relate and/or differ.

Poured into an imperial pint glass carefully, and still formed a 3 1/2" dark brown head over the totally opaque dark brown/black brew. Head fades oh-so slowly, with HEAVY foamy cappucino-type lacing. Aroma is deep, rich coffee. Taste begins with a sweet dark maltiness that is quickly overpowered by the same rich coffee flavors indicated by the nose. Closes with dry coffee grounds in the mouth, and not a bit of alcohol indications. Mouthfeel and drinkability are exemplary, especially for the style. Search this one out, if you needed to be told again... 678 charactersppoitras, Sep 05, 2005
4.36/5  rDev -0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Review # 666.
660 cL bottle (should be a 666 cL) demarcation: Brewed '04 stamp and no notch for a 1-12 month designation. Some 1/8" settled scrod in the bottom of the bottle that I gave the upheaval on the last pour. The cap had 21-5 inside a crown indention and "12" over "B4" inside the inside of the black cap??? 
What the Duece! Excorcised into a Lucifer tulip with an India ink buh-lack opaque pour giving up no ghosts of light against the heavenly light. An angelic obfuscous offering reverse cascading capped with a thick spumescent dark brown statuesque head cap resembling whipped cream and sugar that my Grandma makes. Thick spongy spotty lace left in the glass.
Earthy minerally coffee espresso scents that simply revolve around percolated java joe juice. Similar scents to Bell's Kalamazoo Stout. Some tobacco notes of cigar ash and BBQ charcoal. 
First swigs: Like eating a chocolate covered coffee bean, dunked in an espresso that housed an ashtray. Not much more to add. Eternally lingering coffee grounds and cigar ash finish. A dirty ashtray aftertaste. 
Feel is full bodied with a wicked bitter astringent mouth drying feel. Gentle rolling carbonation that leaves a tongue coating thick finish. To rate this drinkability:
1- The bottle kicked easily
2- I'd buy another tomorrow if I could
3- Enjoyable flavor that can't be found elsewhere
Last swigs: A cigar was extinguished into my double espresso. Not the most "coffee" aromas ever noticed, but the "most" coffee flavors. If this sinful beer is heaven to you, Weyerbacher Black Hole will get you into purgatory with the black strap molases flavor. After drinking an bottle, don't bother tasting anything else for a week to ten days. I feel so spoiled since last night we all split a FFF DL bottle. As my fellow BA GeoffFromSJ once said, complexity over intensity can be the most enjoyable beer experience. This is INTENSE!!! and since I am a coffee junky to the Nth degree, Péché Mortel is a dark delight. An adumbration celebration. If you can't get your mits on Péché Mortel, boil a quart of water with an entire 64 oz. can of Folgers and chill. Thanks to GeoffFromSJ for the chance to "kick over the traces, shatter the Decalogue" and check out this Mortal "Fish." ( &lt;--- sorry PopeDX) Not to show-off my French, but how this is a deadly "ordinate of the endpoint of an arc of a unit circle centered at the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system, the arc being of length x and measured counterclockwise from the point (1, 0) if x is positive or clockwise if x is negative" is beyond me.

bottom is settled and some clarity can be seen in the top 10% of this beer.. something reddish black. still head is slight and creamy, off white-approaching beige. aroma is pure coffee grounds, like opening up the garbage when you get home from work, seeing the waste from the coffee pot and being struck with that odor. some nuttiness as well, leading to a sweeter nose. perhaps chicory. surprisingly leans more toward nescafe instant than starbucks sumatran. taste begins as the expected coffee bomb, in the form of a fancy coffee drink... like a dunkin donuts frappucino. for a coffee stout, this is a flawless example of what you would expect. the hype and quality dwells on the depth and richness of the coffee flavor and lack of inhibiting bitterness. milkstoutlike creamy sweetness reminds me more of nutrasweet in my coffee than malt in my beer. 
g/f thinks this is too 'alcoholey,' but i dont get that at all, maybe im too conditioned to big beers. sure, its smooth and drinkable, but there's not much more to it. maybe the best of the coffee stouts (not the best if you count dark lord), but that would only really matter to a coffee stout head... which i am not. a perfectly quaffable and enjoyable beer. next time i have $8 to spend, and its between this and a chalice of st bernardus abt 12 or another staple big beer, ill skip by the peche mortel... 1,580 charactersgoodbyeohio, Aug 22, 2005
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle 11/04... Explosive, poured opaque black color with a medium sized tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Great aroma of coffee, chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla, bourbon, and anise. More of the same in the taste, lots of coffee and light alcohol. High quality beer, I actually am excited to try this on nitro, because as others have said, the extra carbonation is the only drawback.
Nitro Draft 7/05... Creamy mouthfeel with a great balance of chocolate and roasted coffee malts. Faint alcohol in the background. Now I see what the big deal is. 557 charactersegajdzis, Aug 05, 2005
4.26/5  rDev -3.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Bomber provided by PatYoda...thanks for the opportunity! Bottle date = 11/04. Pours a one finger walnut brown head over a stark black liquid. Dark even when held to light. Smells woody coffeeish (a little bit like french roast coffee) and vanilla. A hint of something...not quite terpentine, but in that line. In context with the other flavors, it's not a negative, it's interesting. Tastes rich coffee, but also a really rich chocolate. Like crunching on a couple coffee beans while holding a mouth full of sweet dark chocolate. There is a bitter from the coffee and/or roasted barley, but the wet sweet of the chocolate counters it to the point that the aftertaste leaves my mouth watering for more candy. Too bad my wife wasn't around when I cracked open this one...she would have loved it. I've only had one glass (I shared the bomber with absolutesites), but it's quite filling. Alcohol burn is barely noticable during the swallow, as it mixes with the coffee bitter that is covered by the chocolate. Very intense flavors, but only flavors of coffee and chocolate...not much else. Considering the intensity of the flavors, I would have expected the body to be more than medium. Also in the mouthfeel, I should note the aftertaste almost felt like there were tiny pulverized bits of roast floating around in the chocolatey nectar that hung on my tongue. Carbonation is moderate and the head has hung around until the very end. Both the smell and taste are very enticing and I kept putting the glass to my mouth immediately after drawing it away from the last sip. This could become a banned substance someday. 1,613 charactersmentor, Jul 15, 2005
4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Price tag says $17.49 from Wine Warehouse. Poured from a 22 oz bomber in to a 25 oz crystal sniffer glass. The beer is intensely black in color and looks like a helping of thick soy sauce. Yum. The first thing I really notice is the big, fluffy, brown head. It is creamy and thick and dark. It looks like it has a skin on top as the head settles and just sits there like a rock. The head leaves a thick, grainy lacing on the side of the glass. The head is damn near frightening. It is menacing and it would probably kick your ass if you look at it cross-eyed. Good thing I didn't. 
Smell: The nose is strong coffee of espresso-like potency. There is a light scent of dark chocolate too.
Taste: Sweet and creamy with lots of coffee flavor. There is brown sugar, dark chocolate and a dry roastiness that borders on burnt. Light hop bitterness sits near the end with some fruitiness that resembles black cherries.
Mouthfeel: Dry and sandy but still smooth and thick. Very full bodied creamy.
Drinkability: This is an all around great beer. Of course, if you like coffee, this is indeed your beer. On the flip side if you hate the taste of coffee, stay away. This beer combines dark chocolate and espresso flavors wonderfully. Very tasty. 1,258 charactersBrewMaster, Jul 05, 2005
4.73/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Inky black beer topped by a thick, fluffy, chocolate coloured head. Superb head retention that resulted in thick clumps of foam sticking to the sides of the glass. Absolutely gorgeous. The aroma can be summed up as espresso with some other stuff thrown in, like bitter chocolate, rich malty sweetness, and a bit of ripe, dark fruits. But it's mostly about the espresso, just like the flavour. Espresso and roasted grains dominate, with bitter chocolate and hop bitterness providing balance, along with sweet maltiness. The finish is dry and roasty with some alcohol warmth that lingers and is a bit peppery to start. The moderate carbonation melded perfectly with the rich, full body, creating a creamy texture that provides a nice contrast to the roasted dryness. As bold as the flavours and aromas are, it is remarkably well-balanced and highly drinkable. The surprising part for me is that I'm not a coffee drinker at all, but I really enjoyed this beer. If Dieu du Ciel only offered this one beer, it would be well worth a trip to the brewpub (even from Toronto).
Enjoyed at the brewpub after an afternoon at the Mondial. Aged for one year, labeled as #42 from Avril, 2004. 1,180 charactersDrJay, Jun 21, 2005
4.03/5  rDev -8.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours a very dark color with a tall, creamy head that has good retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma makes me think oatmeal coffee stout. The flavor has a lot of coffee and a lot of dark malts, but the alcohol is very apparent. It's a nice big, malty coffee stout, but it has too much alcohol in the flavor, makes it slightly burny. The mouthfeel is a little more thin than I would like it, but still moderate to thick. Drinkability is ok. Don't think I could do a whole bottle of this. 505 charactersclvand0, Jun 16, 2005
4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5SHIT. We have a gusher. Insane exploding that was only kept from a steady flow out of the top by the bottlecap still slightly over the top. I have not had this problem with many beers in the past. 
After diverting the overflow, the beer pours a jet black color with a 2 finger tan head taht subsides to a quarter inch over the liquid. Very intense black color. 
The nose is intense. Big blast of coffee grounds mingle with figs and a nice puff of alcohol. Big big aromas here. 
The flavor is right there with the aroma. Big coffee bitter from start to finish with a small sweet figgyness just popping out right after swallowing the beer. The aftertaste is slightly chocolate sweet, but mostly dark roasted coffee. 
The feel is the only let-down. Its moderate, not big and thick. I want this beer to be just big and chewy. It needs more body.
Drinkability is very good for a 9% ABV. There is only a light warming in my stomach, and a light puff in nose. Very good beer. The flavor is intense but not offensive. Too bad this was my only bottle. I won't hold the gushing against this beer. 1,101 characterskmpitz2, Jun 16, 2005

Thanks to Kev for sharing this one. 22oz. bomber that spewed for 30 seconds upon opening, then poured into a snifter. It pours a deep jet black color with two fingers of medium tan head. There's a good amount of lacing. The smell is so incredibly strong, with lots of espresso and a touch of chocolate. There's some candied plums too. The taste is very rich and malty. There's lots of roasted malt with lots more coffee coming through. A warm mocha finish with just a tad bit of alcohol. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, and for 9%, the drinkability is through the roof. A damn fine beer. Thanks again to Kevin, I owe him bigtime! 641 charactersSheepNutz, Jun 16, 2005
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottled in 11/04: The initial pour goes into a large tulip with about an inch and a half of foam. The head leaves clumps of lace on the sides of the glass.This beer mantains a fifth of an inch of head throughout the session. The nose is one of coffee and roasted malt. Light bitterness is percieved.
 This beer tastes of coffee above all else. I like my coffee as Ilike my beers, that is fully flavored and over the top. I detect more chocolate flavor as I progress through the bomber. This is beginning to look more and more like a frothy cup of coffee. It tastes not as though someone just put 2 packs into the coffee maker; it tastes of gourmet coffee. I deduct a half point only because this brew is one dimensional in flavor.
 Although this is my first review, I must give this beer a five for mouthfeel. Its texture is that of a rootbeer float with lots of melted ice cream in it. It is simply world class. The drinkability is good for the style. I have drained this bottle with efficiency but would certainly not drink another in the same sitting. If you find a bottle for less than $20, consider yourself lucky and buy every last one of them.
 Edit: As this was my first review, I was afraid to give fives. But, after my second bottle, and a little more experience reviewing beers, I feel less ripped off for my $25. The flavor is certainly not one-dimensional, but perhaps like mixing a Rogue Imperial Stout 01 with a Perkuno's Hammer from the cask with a lot of good coffee. Awesome. I think I'll make some pancakes with good Canadian maple syrup to go on top. 1,579 charactersSephiroth, Jun 12, 2005

Incredibly fruity coffee bean aroma, and I mean like freshly roasted beans. Slight alcohol aroma is there too, making for a coffee liqueur-type aroma.
The taste, in my opinion, is all coffee, no beer. I get some chocolate-covered espresso beans, and maybe some other dark fruits covered with dark cocoa. A very dry roasty finish, like good coffee without sugar or cream.
Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.
M-e-h. Meh.
Don't get me wrong. I like coffee in beers, especially the Speedway Stout. But whereas that beer finds balance in its addition of coffee, this one takes it wayyyy over the top. It's good coffee, mind you, and this is a unique, well-crafted beer. But I find it to be overhwelmingly unbalanced. If I wanted an espresso, I'd go to Starbucks.
And when you factor price into the equation, this beer is wildly overrated. 954 charactersbultrey, Jun 01, 2005
4.24/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from bottle (11/04 freshness date) into my pint NERAX tumbler a bit below room temp this beer formed a good inch of medium coarseness head. Smell immediately reminds me of chocolate covered espresso beans. The head collapsed to a solid quarter inch with light brown lacing down the sides of the glass. The taste is immediately that of chocolate malt and coffee beans fading into cherry tart on the back of the tongue but the taste of coffee never really surrenders. A swig is pretty silky on the tongue with a mat of light carbonation raised as it passes into the throat. Overall a pretty entertaining and interesting brew (if you're into coffee) but I think the espresso taste kind of overshadows a lot of potential subtlety for me. Purchased for $16 at Uptown Liquors in Davis Square... 795 charactersOtisCampbell, May 14, 2005
4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Deep black in color with slight ruby highlights. It was topped with a thick, clingy tan head made of oversized carbonated bubbles. The nose hits you with a sharp coffee/espresso aroma up front followed by chocolate a little cherry and roasted malt. WOW, a lot of coffee in the aroma. The heavy coffee aroma allows you to breath it in as you drink the beer. The coffee is followed quickly by a tangy citrus hop character, then the roast malt, and finally some cherry chocolate on the finish. There is a mild bitterness that retains for a while. The beer is thick and rich, and has a decent drinakbility. The sharp bitterness detracts just a little. 647 characterscarln26, May 11, 2005
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Shared a bottle of this at The Publick House with fellow BAs David and Westmalle. Folks, if the price of this beer scares you (whether retail or at a beer bar) All I can say is:1. It's worth it. 2. And why not share the bottle? I would order this up at the Publick House again, no problem.
One initial impression of this beer is: it's a one note beer. It is a coffee beer on steroids, and if you love good rich satisfying coffee (and beer), then it's one to be savored. If you don't, order something else. Pours were noire, with a lovely 1/4 inch coffee crema style head. Aroma was full of wonderful things like cocoa nibs, dark roastiness, raw beer. Sorta great European coffeehouse meets low earthiness. Taste for me was a total espresso experience, some astringency, dark roastiness, again cocoa nibs. The body stands up to this overwhelming taste experience. My only small complaint was that it was hard to find the beer in there. On the other hand, this is a one of a kind tasting experience which I'm glad I got to indulge in. 1,033 charactersPatandDavid, May 07, 2005
4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4No doubt guilty of gluttony, and more, with this one on 5/6/2005. 1 pt. 6 fl. oz. bomber poured twice in a shaker glass.
Thick, billowing inch-high bed of froth and coffee milkshake fluff; beautiful lace and quantity stick throughout. Pitch black hue with some almost imperceptible bubbling apparent at the circumference. Coffee grinds are huge on the nose, just giant, with the associated smokiness/roasted character; black licorice and earthy anis; very muddy kind of tones, but healthy mud, if that is possible, maybe truffle-like. Wild coffee presence on the mouth immediately, just sticky, with a bakers chocolate chalkiness soothing the roast a little; the aforementioned aspects completely mask the not insubstantial alcohol. Meaty mouthfeel that sticks, slips, and slides all over.
As a coffee lover, this is truly amazing. A trip north of the border may be in order. 883 charactersTruh, May 07, 2005

It pours a roofing tar black with a big frothy tan head.
A strong aroma of Kalua jumps right out. The smell of dark roasted malt and light background smell of cut hay peeks through. 
Strong coffee with cream and sugar, dark roasted barley malt, Ovaltine, brown bread, and dark chocolate all vie for attention.
The hops are nearly equally complex, if a bit more subdued than the big malty character of this brew. Tastes of mixed citrus and peppery spices provide the sharp edged bitter kick.
The warming sweet coffee alcohol soothes and finishes like a fine dessert.
Rich and silky mouthfeel!
YUM!
$15.95 for the bottle is a bit extravagant though! 699 charactersBeerResearcher, May 02, 2005
3.92/5  rDev -10.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Ok,
Had this one a while back at The Moan and Dove. It didn't occur to me to review it until I came here and saw how highly it's ranked in the American Double Stout style.
It pours an opaque deep-chocolate brown, bordering on black with a fuzzy caramel head.
Nose is coffee through and through. There's a bit of chocolate buried in there somewhere, but otherwise the coffee comes out like you're sniffing a Starbuck's iced dark roast.
Taste is, well, nothing I would write home about. In short, way too much coffee and way too little stout. It's got a dark character that comes through, and it's by no means unpleasant, but I just never got any alcohol or hop character from it to indicate I was drinking a stout. Kudos to them on hiding the 9.0% abv, but it came across to me as much more of a "flavored" beer than it did a stout, and left me rather disappointed.
Mouthfeel & drinkability were both good.
And that's about it.

4.74/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a dark crimson black with a light tannish colored head, with large carbonation bubbles. Smells of sweet java, coffee beans, espresso, maybe some chocolate burried beneath all of the coffee aromas. Taste is pure coffee. There is a definite nutty background to the brew. You can almost literally taste the caffeine in this beer. This thing definitely packs two buzzs at once. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I would prefer for a stout like this. Make this puppy a little creamier and I would lap it up all the time. A nicely drinkable stout, they didnt over do this one. The price definitely hurts. I could get a lot more breakfast stout for the same price. A worthwhile try definitely, especially if you are into coffee. 732 charactersbnuttz, Apr 28, 2005
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This beer poured as black as the night and formed a huge dirty tan foamy head coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A good deal of carbonation is present. The aroma really smacks you over the head with expresso coffee, malt and a slight peanut odor. The flavor was of malt, coffee and chocolate. The body was creamy, but a bit on the thin side for the style. The warming aspect of the alcohol level is present in the slightly burnt coffee finish. A great beer, but at the current pricing, I would be hard pressed to have this on more than just a rare occasion. 565 charactersWildman, Apr 23, 2005
4.9/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I was at Mahar's in Albany NY on a Monday night, and in the course of conversation Bill (bartender extraordinaire) mentioned this particular beer. Having just purchased my last round for the evening, I made a mental note and came back last night to try it.
In short, this stout is simply amazing.
As others have indicated, it's an opaque coffee stout with a very dark, foamy head and amazing dark chocolate, vanilla, and coffee aroma. I was quite impressed then and there, but was even more so upon a taste. 
I have to note that if you dislike coffee you will pretty much not like this stout. If you do enjoy coffee (good coffee) then you have to try Peche Mortel. 
The first taste that hits you is definitely a strong coffee flavor. In fact, it's so rich a flavor you can almost imagine you're chomping down on an espresso bean. You get a very prominent bitter bite from the free trade coffee (which I particularly enjoyed very much) and then things start to mellow out. Slowly other flavors creep in... more of that dark chocolate flavor becomes apparent after a few seconds, and then hints of vanilla mixed with a mild sweetness almost of cane sugar creep in.
There was much interest at the bar over the bottle's artwork (I believe it's a rendering of "Eve" with the serpent, though one patron was adamant it was Medusa). Upon returning the empty bottle, it made its way up and down the bar for a sniff.
I highly recommend this beer, and suggest you enjoy it in good company. This is one to kick back and relax with, taking in the full experience that this coffee stout has to offer.
A good brew to quench your thirst after mowing the lawn this is most definitely NOT. ;-) 1,696 characterstechcommdood, Apr 20, 2005

Smell: Almost no difference here, roasted, kahlua and milk...
Taste: Coffee bean goodness, and as creamy a Beer as I've ever tasted. The alcohol finish is just a little more present in this version, but still doesn't feel close to 9%, more 3-4%.

Appearance is the nice usual dark color of the Imperial stout, a nice brownish head that never dissapeared from my golass. The smell was of caramel and mainly coffee. The mouthfill was exceptionally sweet and tasty to my palate. The taste was of sweet caramel followed by a huge touch of coffee, reminded me of expresso. A very drinkable beer, but dont abuse from it. Hide very well its high alcohol content. A superb beer from DDC
___
Bottled version: Aged 18 months. (my new review is based on the bottle)
It is a more darker beer than the one on taps, when poored in the glass a dark liquid came out like a dark oil change. It was quick, quite like melasse. Her head was quite magnificient. 
The difference is in taste and smell, the bottled version smells more of alcohol and taste a bit more alcoholic compard to the one on taps.
Also on taps the coffee flavours are more present compared to the one in bottle. 995 characters3Vandoo, Sep 12, 2004

2002 First batch sampled several times at the Dieu Du Ciel brewpub in Montreal, PQ
Appearance: As dark as a starless night. This brew is a deeply opaque black colour with a huge tan head that lasts until the bottom of the glass.
Smell: Todd summed this one up nicely. The aroma of this brew screams Espresso. Fresh espresso beans, fresh espresso coffee, FRESH ESPRESSO! There are also some nice chocolate (milk), caramel, and roasted malt notes hidden beneath the mound of espresso beans.
Taste: This brew tastes like a dream. First the fresh espresso notes hit hard, followed by a nice dark chocolate flavor. Than the roasted malts and the subdued but caramel-like sweetness come into play in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Smooth as silk and as creamy as a milkshake. This is the best beer that I have EVER had off of the nitro-tap. Somehow the flavors are not muted by the nitro-tap. In fact I think that this beers flavors blend wonderfully on nitro (although i've yet to have this aged in the bottle)
Drinkability: How can a 9%abv espresso assault be this easy to drink. This is easily the easiest drinking coffee beer that I have ever consumed. In fact this is one of the easiest drinking strong stouts that I have ever had as well.
Notes: This stuff is awesome! Why-oh-why can we not get this in the states. I really wish that Montreal would change it's laws so Jean-Francois Gravel can start filling growlers of this stuff to go, or better yet bottling it for export. This is really one of the best beers out there! 1,610 charactersfrancisweizen, Jun 23, 2004

It's very very black, like espresso with a tan head of foam. It looks brutal. It smells like bitter strong coffee/espresso, not too much though. It tastes awesome, very roasted and strong and not as bitter as it looks and smells. Like a malty espresso. Mouthfeel was perfect, not as thick as it looks, but not even close to thin. No taste of alcohol either, which could be dangerous if you drink enough of it, but I probably wouldn't just because I can't drink too too much of such a roasty imperial stout like this one. However, I was so glad to have the glasses that I did, and I look forward to visiting DDC again to hopefully have this one again! 773 characterserica, Jun 17, 2004
4.97/5  rDev +13%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Consumed at Le Mondial de la bière 2004 de Montrèal (several times).
A mysterious opaque black brew, topped with a coffee colored head which keeps throughout the experience. Aroma can be summed up in one word: espresso. And I'm not just talking about hints of espresso. I'm talking the intensity, roastiness and richness found in ground espresso bean aromas. Hints of chocolate and warm toffee are muted beneath the thick blanket of espresso.
Taste? Absolutely loaded with more intense espresso flavors, and a smoothed in creaminess likened to sweetened milk coffee that lightens / fluffs up the beer's thickness. Roasty / bitter edge. Hints of burnt raisin and dark chocolate. Touch of smoke. Espresso flavors linger for quite some time, requiring a palate cleanser, which I couldn't bring myself to do. I wanted its bliss to linger forever, so I got another sample of it.
The beer's 9% ABV is well-hidden, in a very dark and evil way, the beer's name, which translates to "Mortal sin." And although Dieu du Ciel tags this as an "Imperial Stout" it should really be tagged as an "Espresso Assault," as this is very much a "coffee infused" beer. Man, this beer nailed the essence of espresso and crammed it into a beer. It's amazing that up until this beer, I've yet to taste a beer that has accomplished this at such level of complexity and intensity.
And not only is this the best coffee infused beer that I've ever had, but this is my pick for the best beer at Le Mondial de la bière 2004 de Montrèal. Although I sampled many great beers over the five days, no other beer even came close to standing out as this beer did.
Jean-François Gravel and Dieu du Ciel should be proud of this magnificent creation and example of how infinitely diverse beer can beer. 1,780 charactersTodd, Jun 08, 2004

4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I'll elaborate a little more on the "peche". It's properly spelled with accents on the "E"s. Pronunciation would be pay-shay. Translated, the name comes across as roughly "mortal sin". Which is an apt name for this beer.
Aged one year before release. Dark black (really? an imperial stout?) The head's tan and actually pours and holds quite well. Nose is thick and draws me in, promising a heavy blow to the head with a sack full of malt and coffee beans. Scotch-like in it's mix of malt thickness and alcohol kick - but tasting of burnt chocolate, coffee, half-fermented raisins, old plums. This is a formidable beer to drink, with all its intimitadory tactics, but once you get to know it, it's good people.
This is the way to do an imperial stout. Much better than Storm King and its fellows with their slimy hop oils that interrogate and sentence all the classic stout flavours. 888 charactersthe42ndtourist, Jun 11, 2003
