All coffee - it contributes strong notes of hazelnuts. There is trace notes of bourbon which adds the complexity to the coffee. Smells sweet and dessert-like, like Tirimisu.  Upon sipping, the coffee is exactly like the aroma. Full-blown hazelnuts with trace bourbon. I admit I never tasted coffee like this in any other stouts. The coffee adds so much flavor yet I appreciate its simplicity as the hazelnuts are so easy to pick up. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and rich. Outstanding beer, well crafted! 603 charactersBenish, May 07, 2017

Great coffee nose like a true Caffe de Monde Vietnamese coffee complete with evaporated milk thick creaminess. For those who know what a vietnamese coffee is can relate to what this means. Just super coffee and bourbon forward yet balanced and full mouth creamy feel. Simple Superb! 402 charactersGambyt20, Apr 29, 2017

aroma is incredibly complex:  strong coffee,  some vanilla/bourbon, tobacco, and as it warms dark fruit (plums/cherries?)
surprisingly creamy for the amount of carbonation (was expecting close to none).  fills the palate and warms with some booziness on the way down. definitely a sipper,  superior to KBS and BC by far. 408 charactersJshbrown40, Apr 27, 2017

Smell is coffee forward with a strong creamy element to it.  Barrel is present as well but somewhat subdued.  You also get the standard vanilla notes with is a bit more pronounced than normal with a somewhat subdued yet present boozy note.  Taste is super creamy.  That comes on first with a strong coffee middle and pleasant barrel end that almost finishes brandi-like.  This beer is a touch light for the style with a touch more carbonation than is normal.  The main takeaway from this beer is creaminess.  Overall it is an excellent beer with lots going on yet all aspects of it are balanced.  Had it side by side with the regular BASS and this is noticeable better.  Not much of a coffee bomb however. 867 charactersAmguerra305, Apr 04, 2017

More often than not the Speedway stouts are well done, but they may have reached the absolute peak with the BA Vietnamese Speedway (2014 edition)..the smell alone on this is devine..a beautiful blend of bourbon, coffee, vanilla, caramel and roastiness..that alone would put it into the upper echelon of beers that I've been lucky enough to consume, but the taste on this exceeds what it smells like..more vanilla than I expected but I'm more than happy with the surprise....this is definitely one of the best beers I've had..all of the flavors are perfectly blended here and none of them is dominant to the others. .a rare feat..alcohol burn is at a minimum and I'm glad I gave this some age before I tried it, but I'd love to try one fresh to get a different perspective. .absolutely fantastic barrel aged beer..best birthday gift I've given to myself in years!! 881 charactersJlabs, Mar 14, 2017

Pours black and smells of vanilla, coffee, and slightly caramelized. Tastes similar to smell with a bit of heat and barrel on the end of a swallow. Feels velvety smooth, creates a wonderful patina on the palate. 279 charactersshareallthebeer, Feb 20, 2017

Pours a dark black body, slight brownish hue, one finger thick brown head, fantastic retention and bits of lacing. Smell is a rich velvety chocolate bourbon bomb; the bourbon is rich and contributes a nice vanilla to the fudgy milk chocolate aromas, which is accentuated even more by the sweeter coffee notes. It's not a roasted in your face type of coffee presence, but it all just seems to make the fudgy chocolate stand out even more. Flavour is similar; a rich chocolate bourbon presence, touch of dark fruit, milk chocolate, coffee, not as much roast, slight nuttiness, almonds, touch of vanilla and coconut, rich fudginess. Excellent. Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth and creamy, good carbonation, with a nice fudge and oak finish. One of the best out there, fantastic stout that we could not leave unfinished. 871 charactersStevedore, Feb 12, 2017

Beautiful pour, nice carb especially considering the age -pitch black with a light khaki head
Smells of vanilla, some roasted coffee, toffee, chocolate (almost like a java chip frappuccino)
Mmmm this is one of the finest BA coffee stouts I've ever tasted (5 easy)
It starts with vanilla, almost a hint of lactose, some roasted flavors -on the back is a lovely complex dark chocolate and a touch of whiskey heat
The mouthfeel is pure velvet deliciousness
I gotta say, this was a pain to track down but completely worth it. This exceeded every expectation and has potentially (permanently) spoiled my palate. If you like stouts, BA stouts, coffee (beer in general?) you must try this at least once. 735 charactersBeantownBrews, Feb 11, 2017

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at Alesmith Anvil and Stave in San Diego, CA.
This one pours a nice dark black, with a light brown head that lingers, and a little bit of lacing.
I am in awe at the aroma- creamy, rich, fruity and chocolatey coffee, brownie batter, hazelnut syrup, cookie dough, oak, and silky sweet bourbon. Can I live in this nose?
The taste is similarly awesome. To sum it up- this tastes like a ball of dark chocolate drizzled cookie dough and brownie batter. The coffee flavor is so well integrated- the creamy and milky vanilla flavor seamlessly fades into the vanillin and oaky flavors from the barrels. There's a light dark fruit component too. The bourbon is folded perfectly into everything else. This beer unfolds in so many different layers. It's so decadent and surprisingly easy to drink for the ABV. There is a slight bitterness from the malt that balances things out nicely as well.
There is no alcohol present to this on draft- it's insane. It's wonderfully creamy, with a long sweet and creamy finish. It definitely feels lactose influenced.
This is the best beer I've ever had. It is absolutely a perfect beer- I'm not sure I could think of a way to improve it. It's so flavorful and bold, but without being overbearing or too sweet. Alesmith make the best dark beers in the country. I must be dead- because there's no way one beer tastes this good. 1,363 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jan 23, 2017

Misc.: N/A
This was pretty much my most sought after beer. Absolutely loved the regular Vietnamese Coffee version (4.53) and expect this one to be the best beer I ever tried. That good. Was lucky enough to get a free pour while going to Emily’s birthday party. A huge thanks to Chris and Lesley for probably a huge tab. Rushed this, but here’s to heaven.
Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of frothy tan head when I got it. Very serene setting underneath the chaos. Excellent spotty lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.25)
Smelled smooth buttery bourbon, milk chocolate syrup, cocoa, some malt chocolate, creamy espresso, vanilla, toffee and sweet caramel. (Smell - 4.75)
Wow on the taste. Still than milky chocolate syrup, malt chocolate, smooth bourbon, creamy vanilla, touch of oak, espresso, lactose and coffee creamer. (Taste - 4.75)
Full body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. (Feel - 4.75)
Just as awesome as I hoped it would be. So glad I got the chance to have it. Unfortunately I feel like I slightly overrated it a tad. (Overall - 4.75)

Opened next to Kane Fifth, so it fell a bit short in comparison, but it is excellent on its own. 204 charactersBsquirrelbrewer, Dec 30, 2016

Look - black body with tan head...decent lacing
Smell - bourbon, oak, vanilla, coffee is mellow but nice and fresh too, not super roasty and the milk chocolate comes through nicely
Taste - follows the nose, subtle but brilliant flavors molded together, great presence from the barrel
          -2014 has marshmallow open up once warmed up.  Really great flavors from the barrel here.  Coffee is extremely subtle but provides a nice roastiness
Feel - thick, oily, creamy, not boozy at all
Overall - amazing beer.  they've perfected barrel aging IMO and I will continue to chase these. 696 charactersrabbott2, Dec 05, 2016

Smell - Bourbon, coffee, chocolate and vanilla. This smells amazing. 
Taste - Absolutely decadent. Tons of barrel...oak and vanilla. Nice coffee and chocolate here. Absolutely delicious. 
Feel - Full bodied. Thick, creamy, slick, oily and coating. One of the most perfect mouthfeels I've ever experienced. 
Overall - Hands down the best BA Alesmith beer I've ever tasted. Easy to see why this one is rated so highly. 
Glad I have more bottles! 518 charactersRAlmeida77, Dec 05, 2016

Strong barrel presence, good coffee forward roast but overall unbalanced flavors with some unpleasant acidity.  Perhaps it was too young but flavors had not melded to overcome the alcohol heat.  Still an excellent stout in its own right but I don't see it warranting a BA 100 compared to some of the other big stouts out there. 411 charactersDoctorMyEye, Nov 27, 2016

4.87/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this on tap at Alesmith on 11/12. Most noticeable was how creamy/silky this beer was off the first sip. Nice mouthfeel, really pleasant vanilla and chocolate notes. Coffee and bourbon on the back end, no alcohol burn to speak of and remarkably smooth for the alcohol content. This was my first time having this, although I have had the barrel aged and vietnamese coffee versions. Needless to say, I never really enjoyed either variant that much, feeling the coffee or bourbon overshadowed the other flavors, but this variant has everything working in perfect harmony. Easily the best beer I have had from Alesmith and definitely in my top 3. 645 charactersblockdude, Nov 13, 2016

The mouthfeel is bigger and the way the Vietnamese coffee comes through, solid throughout. A complex BA stout that doesn't have an overly strong coffee presence. One of the very best BA stouts I've ever had. 322 charactersputonyourwalkingshoes, Nov 13, 2016
4.99/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Look: Black as night.  Pours with a foamy head that fades within seconds leaving a khaki colored outer ring.
Smell: Bourbon and coffee hits right away.  It's a sweeter nose than expected.
Taste: I was surprised here.  The first things that hit me was a bust of vanilla and oak.  Coffee is subdued a bit from the time in the bottle but it was still there.  Bourbon is also fading but again, still present.  Flavors come in waves.
Feel: Thick, creamy, stick, oily...however you want to describe it, its amazing.  Probably the best part of this beer is the feel and that's impressive considering it tastes and smells amazing.
Overall: Easily the best BA Speedway for me and I've had a ton.  Recently had a '13 BASS and this crushes it.  I'm excited to get my hands on a '16 or two and let one sit for a bit like this one.  This was one of the best beers I've ever had. 869 charactersJStampler, Nov 11, 2016

Bourbon is there, but it doesn't taste quite as boozy as the standard barrel-aged Speedway Stout, primarily because beautiful coffee notes really shine through at the back end after every sip.  Soft, full mouth-feel and a sipper for sure. 337 characterseifster82, Sep 04, 2016

4.68/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75I know this is the only version of Speedway that got the perfect 100, but I was (very sadly) a bit underwhelmed. It was still phenomenal, and I'm really glad I tried it, but I would say the regular, or BBA regular was still my preference.
Appearance: lighter in color, a tad more translucent than regular SS. A bit lighter brown, shinier, looked a little thinner (but definitely didn't taste any thinner!)
Smell: a lot of bourbon, really hid the Vietnamese coffee more than I would've liked. Bourbon really overtakes the nose, although over a firm foundation of aromatic coffee/stouty/thick Speedway.
Taste: Here's where I really wanted a little more - it really tasted like just BBA speedway, the vietnamese coffee wasn't really present. If anything, I could taste a more bitter and stronger aftertaste, which would've been great if it has been accompanied by strong vientamese coffee notes, but I think it just got lost in the sauce in this one.
Mouthfeel: still spectacular. thick, creamy, bold, heavy, full-bodied...Speedway really captures my ideal mouthfeel for a big ol' stout. just perfect.
Overall: glad I got to knock off another 100 Beer Advocate beer off my list, but I would hesitate to say it's the best version. Still, buy it whenever you can, it's worth it. 1,278 charactersFinestCityBeerGuy, Aug 15, 2016

L: Pours black with a small head that fades fast.  
S: coffee, rich chocolate, sweet bourbon. Very nice to get all 3 components.
T: Big barrel sweetness, the coffee is there but not over powering.  There is still a little heat on the back end, not bad but noticeable.
F: very smooth and creamy.  It's very coating, but not the thickest.
O: A big upgrade from regualr ba speedway, a great beer! 415 charactersyesterdayfaraway, Jun 15, 2016

Pours nice with a brown head, lots of coffee on the nose, mouthfeel is nice, but not quite to the level of rare, after a few sips this one really shines, lots of coffee and superb blend of base stout, coffee and barrel.

Like the others, pours a pitch black color with one inch of dark tan head and low carbonation evident. Awesome sweet bourbon nose and taste...love it. Lots of bourbon, milk chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla, caramel malts, and toffee. Amazingly smooth  and great mouthfeel.
Overall a fantastic beer; one of the best at the tasting. I think this beer does so well in Bourbon barrels and this one did not disappoint. One of the best. 488 charactersmdfb79, Dec 02, 2015

Whomever handles the coffee production at Alesmith should be given a medal and a boat load of cash. Perfectly balanced the coffee, barrel and base stout. Slightly sweet but in a good way. Notes of vanilla helps the balance. Chewy mouthfeel. This beer is under hyped. It should be held in higher  regard. 408 characterssteveheady, Sep 12, 2015
4.98/5  rDev +6.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5A - Opaque black with a fairly quickly dissipating tannish head. 
S - aggressive coffee nose pops right off the bat. Faint vanilla from the barrel in the background. Hint of cacao nibs but mainly that amazing coffee
T - cold brew coffee with a background of toffee, cacao, caramel malts. Freaking delicious, the best parts of the base Vietnamese with added vanilla/bourbon/oak presence. 
M - silky and smooth, perfect stout coating
O - very impressed, worth trading for and very close to being a top 5 for me. 513 charactersHesscabob, Sep 07, 2015

A   black liquid that has a thumbnail deep cola edge, two fingers of dark foam has decent retention leaving just a few polka dots of lace, some color and wide legs try to form on the side of the glass
S  this stuff smells intense, the second I pop the cap you get a whiff, bourbon, booze, and coffee hit me first followed by vanilla, coconut, marshmallow, and chocolate fudge, the barrel and coffee work well together 
T  chocolate covered bourbon soaked coffee beans, booze comes out even more then the nose but still well concealed for 12%, more barrel, more of everything really, shes a big one, intense stuff 
M  thick but not chewy, silky, enough bubbles to give it some life, some heat but its well managed all things considered, a little sticky on the lips, charred coffee linger 
O  a little booze popping up here and there but to be expected in such a big beer, great coffee notes, lots of bourbon barrel, shes a winner 
One of those beers that needs age but would lose some of its great qualities with cellar time, dammed if you do and I'll stop short of saying dammed if you don't because this ones great right now. 1,212 characterswordemupg, Aug 23, 2015

Full of fudge and ground coffee on the nose with lots of dough cream and a warming barrel appearance. Coffee is extremely well pronounced, revealing a flowery berry quality, gently wrapped up into fudge and charred malts. 
Drinks outstandingly smooth, very soft on the tongue with an intense barrel infusion, creating a hot bite during the finish, together with bitter coffee.
Tastes of sweeter fudge, immediately coated up by earthy, silk coffee with a faint berry quality to it. This foundation gets joined by a prominent, vanilla heavy, warming barrel, adding smoky oak, camp fire warmth, resin and a whiff of hazelnuts to the taste. Finishes with present, hot, dry bourbon among cream, coated by coffee and fudgy booze.
Features a full bodied beer, surprisingly fudgy, with flowery, berry infused ground coffee. Extremely smooth, almost easy drinking if it wasnt for the prominent barrel. 960 charactersaleigator, Jun 28, 2015

Pours a deep black, inky body with a dark, mocha brown head that reduces fairly slowly to leave a little lacing and decent retention.
Aromas are rich with delicious vanilla bean, freshly baked cake, fudge brownies, bourbon whiskey, coffee. Very inviting, very pleasing.
On the tongue the nose is matched, vanilla and milk chocolate, roasty coffee on the finish, chocolate and caramel, finish is roasty and rich. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous with low carbonation.
What an awesome beer, one of the best coffee stouts I've ever tasted, so rich and full bodied, complex and balanced. Seek it out! 677 charactersgcamparone, Jun 27, 2015

I personally got a nice coffee nose and bourbon notes.  The Vietnamese coffee stout on it's own was very creamy, with a great lactose feel and I got that same character from the barrel aged version.  The beer remained very creamy.  As it warmed the coffee nose seemed to dissipate and the beer became "hot."  But overall, for my taste a fantastic beer. 493 charactersMLDucky, Jun 01, 2015

It's not a terrible beer by any means, but it tastes like cheap whiskey and I barely detect the coffee. I'm not a fan of overpowering flavors so I appreciate that the coffee is more subtle than certain contemporaries (I'm looking at you BCBCS). Unfortunately the barrel dominates and this particular flavor is off putting. It's actually surprisingly thin too. Much preferred the regular Viet version. Kind of pissed at myself because I really wanted to trade this but happen to agree with the try-it-first approach. It has been out of the fridge for an hour but if it improves by room temperature will report back. 689 characterskvgomps, May 27, 2015

The taste is what really didn't do it for me. It's the generic vanilla flavor I get from it. The bourbon isn't as well done as I've come to expect from others such as BT or BCBS, it's very weak and almost represents a "blended" taste. The coffee is nothing special as I think t was what was supposed to be the main point of this variant. I think that it just gets lost in the barrel aging process, which sucks cause a cup of Vietnamese coffee sound good right about meow. Feel is just as you would expect, nothing special. Sorry for the hate, but I do not love this beer. 849 charactersPlinyBeMiney, May 19, 2015

Consumed: 5.9.15
A: 4.75 Pours pitch black and looks very thick. The dense, tan head is about an inch and lasts for a couple minutes with good lacing.
S: 5 This is probably the best smelling beer I’ve encountered. Immediately, there is so much going on: hazelnuts, vanilla, chocolate, coconut, roasted malt, mild coffee, bourbon, molasses, and caramel.
T: 4.75 The flavor starts off a bit sweet the moves quickly to similar flavors from the nose mixing into the roasted malt background and more sweet coffee. The beer is a bit harsh when cold, but as it warms it mellows out dramatically. Like the nose, there’s a lot of vanilla, chocolate, and bourbon, but on the palate, cinnamon and some dark fruits show up too (similar to regular Vietnamese Speedway). Coffee lingers on the finish with a touch of bitterness leaving you wanting another sip.
M: 4.75 Super thick, almost chewy with perfect carbonation that keeps the beer feeling lively. The only flaw is that this beer is so rich and thick it hinders drinkability slightly.
O: 4.75 The whole speedway series is really exceptional and adding barrel presence takes this to the next level. There are so many terrific flavors and aromas while still being balanced. This is a nearly perfect beer. 1,275 charactersTele, May 10, 2015

Taste starts with the strong coffee forward taste but not very bitter. Then rolls to a smooth bourbon finish. As this warmed much more of the oak character came out. Aging the normal great regular beer did wonders for this beer. 339 characterslupercmda, May 01, 2015

4.6/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle, poured into a Bourbon County snifter. Enjoyed on 4.17.2015, reviewed from Tasting Journal.
The beer pours a nice, deep, jet black color, viscous and thick, intensely opaque with a thick, finger of caramel head, low retention but a few spots of lace persist. The aroma is wonderful, huge marshmallow, chocolate, vanilla, stone fruits, barrel char, bourbon, light coffee, very balanced, very complex. The flavors echo the nose, so rich and decadent, but dangerously drinkable, loads of marshmallow and chocolate, coffee roast is mild, nice fruit profile, bourbon, charred barrel, chewy oak, vanilla bean, toffee sweetness lingers. The mouthfeel is fantastic, silky, incredibly smooth, low carbonation, coating, warming, super easy finish.
Verdict: An amazing beer from AleSmith, super complex, rich, decadent, delicate, but it hides the ABV masterfully and is so approachable. Definitely one of the better barrel aged beers I've had the pleasure of enjoying lately. 981 characterskevanb, Apr 18, 2015

L: Almost entirely pitch black with a dark red hue when held to the light. A slightly aggressive pour yields about a 2mm mocha head that stays, with some light carbonation, but just enough to stir up that beautiful bourbon barrel aged imperial stout swirl. Impressive for a beer aged in barrels 13 months. 
S: Ridiculous aroma on this beer. Huge oak... I have never smelled more oak character in any other barrel aged beer before including BCBS, Parabola, etc... chocolate, toasted coconut, vanilla and butterscotch also come through, all with their own separate and unique character. One of the best smelling beers I've had the pleasure of experiencing. Right up there with Bourbon County and BVDL.
T: Massive oak, milk chocolate, almonds, toasted coconut, subtle coffee and vanilla flavor that becomes much more prominent as the beer warms. Very cohesive, impressive and just insanely enjoyable.
F: Smooth and just slightly sticky. A little bit harsh of a finish when refrigerator-cold, but when warmed to around 50-55 degrees, it's almost pristine. Hard to believe it's 12%. It coats the mouth nicely and the oak, toasted coconut and vanilla flavors really linger, lining you up for the next sip. 
O: One of the best bourbon barrel aged beers... period. It would be hard to get any better than this really. The coffee is almost non-existent, but I feel like it could subtly be what's keeping it all from ending up too sweet. Now I just need more... 1,491 charactersmig100, Mar 28, 2015

4.55/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured out much like the original Vietnamese Speedway but this one I felt really didn't quite hit the same mark. I know everyone loves putting shit into barrels but I think that actually hindered this beer. The barrel kind of over powered the really good coffee aromas and flavors that the non-barrel aged version has. Overall it's still a great beer but I would take the non-barrel aged version any day. 404 charactersKnapp85, Mar 07, 2015

The beer hits of dark chocolate and cacao, and some coffee cake up front, along with some fudge chocolate flavor, yet slightly missing on the thick mouthfeel. Then loads of vanilla with a slight oak drying.
The vanilla is quite forward and makes this beer slightly different from the regular BA Speedway. The beer inches ahead of that brew. 407 charactersdar482, Mar 06, 2015

Appearance - Black body.  Big khaki head.  Medium collar.
Smell - Bourbon.  Kinda nutty.  Chocolate.  I don't get a ton of coffee, though.
Taste - Now I get coffee.  Lots of bourbon too.  Both are sharp flavors.  Bourbon and nutty malts.  Bright coffee flavor.  Oak comes through in the back end.  It has a different sort of flavor in the finish.  Has a little bit of a sharp flavor, like a bit of red wine.
Mouthfeel - Heavy.  Boozy.  Medium carbonation.
Overall - Excellent.  The finish is just a bit odd, but otherwise fantastic. 574 charactersAlieniloquium, Feb 17, 2015

A: Pours black with a thin film of dark brown head.  Somewhat largish bubbles.  Recedes fairly quickly to a very persistent collar.  Minimal lacing.
S: Dark coffee, cream, vanilla bean, light oak, a bit of roast, a touch of cocoa powder.  
T: It’s got that rich, creamy Vietnamese coffee up front, supported by the perfectly integrated, slightly sweet bourbon, along with notes of cola, char, oak, roast, and vanilla bean.  Just a touch of sweetness which really works well.  Dark sweet chocolate as it hits room temp. 
M: Full bodied, creamy, with medium, slightly sharp carbonation. 
O: Absolutely delicious, maintaining the rich, creamy character of the Vietnamese Speedway, but adding notes of the bourbon and oak which really elevates this to another level.  
This is my favorite BA version of Speedway, and tied with the Vanilla/Coconut and Nutella among all Speedway variants. 960 characterspmarlowe, Feb 16, 2015

Darker pour than the regular Vietnamese coffee with a very nice one-finger mocha head. That bourbon booze was definitely detected in the nose, slight coffee - not as overpowering like the regular version. Reminds me of the barrel-aged Old Raspy, hints of vanilla and oak throughout the flavors. This was definitely a smooth tasting beer - keeps the regular Vietnamese coffee flavors intact along with roasty marshmallows as well. Medium bodied and good thickness throughout. 563 charactersCuriousMonk, Feb 06, 2015

4.99/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Look: I read a thread recently pointing out that rating a stout's "look" can seem arbitrary, since there's often little to no head, and on most the color can't be elaborated on beyond "black". This is a great looking beer, with a creamy light-mocha head that sticks around as long as the heads on far lighter beers. 
Smell: Fantastic nose, creamy vanilla, bourbon, milk chocolate. Anchoring the flavors together is the Vietnamese coffee, which is truly a perfect match for bourbon barrel aging; the creamy sweetness of this style of coffee blends so well with the aromas imparted by the barrel. Roast malts combo with the coffee to impart some balancing bitterness. 
Flavor: Follows the nose. Wonderful. All the flavors meld together so well, instead of presenting themselves in waves or varying levels, everything greets the palate as a smooth, cohesive whole. Definitely sweet and boozy, but with enough bitterness to maintain balance.
Feel: Silky smooth, with a perfect touch of carbonation to keep things interesting.
Overall: Incredibly good, A+ level beer. Definitely belongs in the top tier for the style. Would love to see this bottled again, it's definitely worth seeking out. 1,190 charactersThepleasantimbiber, Jan 12, 2015

Best coffee stout I've had to date (including Mocha Wed, Eclipse Java, and BCBCS). Definitely best coffee beer ever. Perhaps best stout? Not sure. I agree with what most said about the flavors and definitely lives up to the hype. I could easily drink the bottle, whereas other stouts would've been a bit too much for me to finish in one sitting. 416 charactersRollzroyce21, Jan 03, 2015

4.85/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Hold on to yerr pants, cause this one is a doozy!
Look: Dark and viscous with no light able to permeate my glass. Poured rather aggressively, this beer yields a dark mocha, finger sized, head. Beautiful!
Smell: Looking for a little more coffee here personally, as the nose is dominated by bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate notes, with very faint coffee. 
Taste: Luckily the coffee shines through here. The vietnamese coffee makes this beer creamy and rich. After the coffee comes beautiful layers of bourbon, chocolate, and vanilla. Slight roasty bitterness with more coffee on the finish. Not overly sweet. Very drinkable and leaves me wanting more every time. 
Feel: Thick, creamy, and viscous. Perfect.
Overall: Given all the hype around it, this beer continued to exceed my expectations. One of the best barrel aged coffee stouts I've had, if not the best. I think there is a certain temperature that this beer drinks really well at. If it's too cold, you lose most of the bourbon. While as it approaches room temperature, all the coffee flavors give way to the bourbon. So it's probably best to not let it get too warm. 1,127 charactersjamesar, Jan 02, 2015

Starting out as a big fan of Firestone Walker barrel series,  I wouldn't think that I would find any beers up to par with them. Alesmith has proven time and time again that they can make good bourbon Ba beers but with coffee, which is a plus for me. This particular bottle is a whale at it's finest and has exceeded enough hype to prove it. I am fortunate to still have a couple of bottles left to see how it ages, Cheers! 494 charactersFlip4beers, Dec 03, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +1.7%On Tap at Alesmith Brewery for BA Vietnamese coffee speedway stout
picked up a few bottle and enjoyed a lovely taster.
A. poured black with little to no head, if so almond in color which dissipated quick. 
S. Dark rich coffee, big vanilla and bourbon, a small hint of dark fruits possibly figs
T. Incredibly well balance, the taste of bourbon was almost perfect, the coffee was rich and creamy similar to any exceptional vietnamese coffee. And a lovely vanilla present throughout the palate. the beer is calculated at 12% ABV which give a soft burn at the back end but the taste of booze was barely present. 
M medium to full body more on the full side, velvet and slight creamy
Overall - Let say I had pick up BLACK Tuesday the following day and had a nice taste to end my weekend. Both amazing beer that put up a fight, and personally BA Viet coffee speedway stout was more memorable. 888 charactersBeerME_562, Nov 18, 2014

Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, lactose, and bourbon aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, coffee, lactose, and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a fantastic barrel aged presence that adds another tasty dimension to the already great base beer. 757 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jun 04, 2014
