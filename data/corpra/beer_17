T: Jesus. A beautiful blend of bourbon, milk chocolate, whoppers, light coconut, loads of vanilla and caramel. Mouthfeel shows nothing of the booze. Tastes way closer to 7-8% than 14. Just a fantastic beer. 355 charactersnotchucknorris, May 17, 2017

Looks nice and dark. Not very thick on the pour lacks a bit of head as expected from BBA aging. Smells vanilla all the way. 
First sip, this reminds me of Bourbon County with less booziness and more vanilla. Is this what Vanilla Rye tastes like?? Amazing flavor and balance. Chewy thickness is excellent. Gets more flavorful as it warms a bit.
Overall an excellent stout which is one of my favorites. I've also had Ground State from same year and must say that Bottle Logic knows how to make an excellent stout. 544 charactersCraftBeerLos, Apr 23, 2017

Had side by side with 4 Hands Madagascar which I knew would make Madagascar (one of my favorite BA Vanilla Stouts) taste one noted. Don't get me wrong Madagascar is amazing full on vanilla with great barrel notes on the back end. This pours ink black and the nose is very complex and balanced. Getting robust aromas of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, & oak all very strong and equally balanced. Which is rare when the flavors are this potent usually one dominates but not FO, fully balanced in your face nose and the flavor fully follows. All the complexity up front and on the finish. Very smooth and thick mouth feel. Absolutely lived up to the hype for me. 672 charactersGambyt20, Mar 11, 2017

Taste was even more one-note than expected: sugary sweet vanilla extract. Too sugary, not enough barrel, little roast / malt complexity to balance it out. Would've loved choxolate, roast, less sweetness, More mouthfeel. Slight bourbon burn. Any barrel nuance is drowned in simple syrup. Mouthfeel was pleasantly sticky. 
A beer for people who like eating spoonfuls of frosting out of the tin, and order Frappacinos with extra whip cream. This is America after all so I do see the appeal. Not a favorite of mine. 573 charactersPDXAmbassador, Mar 04, 2017

Pours a pitch black with a small tan head that dissipates. Smell is full of vanilla with fudge brownies. Taste matches the smell, simply delicious. The bourbon and the mouthfeel are very well balanced. It neither drank too thin nor too much like syrup; for me it hit the sweet spot in the middle. Likewise for the bourbon, there's enough for you to know it's there, but not too much, such that it coexists nicely with the vanilla and fudge-y goodness. Simply put, this might be the best beer I've had the pleasure of drinking. 536 charactersBryan_Schmidt, Jan 08, 2017

A: Pitch black, thin tan head. Pours viscous. 
S: Chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, marshmallow. 
T: Just like the nose, but not as boozy as the nose would suggest. Reminds me of vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup and liquid marshmallow topping. It's sweet, but the booze cuts it down from being too much.
M: Lighter than full, but barely. It's a full mouthfeel, but not oily and as viscous as say VR.
O: Drinking both batches side by side was fun. Both were excellent beers and I can understand all the hype this one gets. Just a hair behind VR. 576 charactersAMCimpi, Jan 02, 2017

3.83/5  rDev -18%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.75Looks like an imperial stout. Deep black.
Smell of vanilla, but only minimally so. Just a hint of bourbon on the nose, which I prefer.
I simply expected a bigger beer based on the description. This beer comes off as  a porter to me, which I found disappointing given the expectations.
The feel strongly contributed to my disappointment. Thin and again, more reminiscent of a porter than a stout and nothing close to an imperial stout.
Overall, I simply don't understand the hype behind this beer, maybe the most overrated beer in the top 250. 546 charactersJamLand, Dec 21, 2016

4.76/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75L: Pours motor oil-esque, almost totally black. When held to the light, some slight red hue shines through at the surface. Almost no head retention, although huge legs stick to the glass. 
S: Bittersweet vanilla beans, milk and dark chocolate, almonds, char and oak, the vanilla beans are so prominent and fragrant wafting from the glass. 
T: A huge explosion of vanilla beans and milk chocolate. Pure liquid fudge brownies with chocolate chips and vanilla.
F: Smooth marshmallow and fudge finish that reveals more depth as it lingers, the linger never really fades away between sips. The alcohol is basically non-existent (at least at 14.1%) and the beer remains a pleasure on the palate over the course of the bottle, without a trace of fatigue, which is rare even for world class barrel aged imperial stouts. 
Overall, FO lives up to a lot of the hype. At the same time, it also isn't quite as good as VR, but that's splitting hairs, since it's truly and undeniably one of the best barrel aged imperial stouts out there. 1,027 charactersmig100, Dec 18, 2016

S- Lots of vanilla. Some bourbon with just a little bit of milk chocolate.
T- Rich flavor. Fudge, milk chocolate, quite a bit of vanilla. Perfect amount of bourbon, adds flavor without overwhelming. Only complaint is that every now and then I get a bit of an artificial vanilla taste in the aftertaste. However, that becomes a non-issue once it warms (started at cellar temp, about 55). 
F- It's a little thin, but it doesn't have a major negative effect on the feel. Decent amount of carb relative to some other stouts I've had, which helps. 
O- It's not quite as good as VR or FVM. However, it's very good. Admittedly I'm a sucker for vanilla stouts, but this had a nice chocolate/vanilla/bourbon balance. I wish this were a little easier for me to get. 843 charactersZoomslowik, Dec 17, 2016

The aroma is desserty with fudge, bourbon, vanilla chocolate cake.
The flavor is more cohesive than Vanilla Rye. Vanilla driving through with dessert flavors without too much extract, fudgey chocolate, sweet bourbon, full mouthfeel cut off by some alcohol, dark fruit. The beer actually drinks with much similarity to the enormity of Bourbon County. 471 charactersdar482, Dec 15, 2016

Pours entirely black with a nice viscosity, producing a very small, dark brown head. Its head vanishes immediately to a tiny ring of lacing, opening up the view into a black abyss.
This packs an astonishing amount of vanilla, in an unbeliveable richness, perfectly complimenting the complex base beer. Flowery vanilla beans, milk chocolate, fudge, a whiff of molasses and roasty malts create the pleasant nose of this.
Its mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, thick and fudgy with the barrel being recognizable throughout, without producing even the slightest booze bite. Outstanding.
Tastes of toasted whole grain bread, caramel, loads of milk chocolate and fudge. This gets even creamier once the spicy barrel becomes recognizable, lending oak, bitter chocolate and a note of cinnamon to the flavors, without any heat at all. Finishes with brownie batter, more flowery vanilla and a wooden dryness.
Wow, this is awesome. Incredibly smooth and rich, thick and luscious from start till the end. No flaws, but an incredibly well nuanced balance, highlighting the vanilla in a perfect way. Turns sweeter in the end, revealing a huge amount of fudge and bitter chocolate to playfully preserve the balance of the beer. 1,241 charactersaleigator, Dec 12, 2016

Pours a pitch black liquid with basically no head at all.  Strong bourbon nose with mild vanilla upon pour.  However, as the beer warms, the vanilla really opens up, and is very well balanced with the bourbon note.  This is a no nonsense, straight up vanilla bean IS.  A definite dessert beer that goes well with brownies or ice-cream.   The feel is just vanilla smooooooth at the end, really no booziness even as it warmed. 
Overall, this is a very impressive Bourbon BA vanilla bean IS.  Among the very best.  It's up there with BC Vanilla Rye (but a notch below VBDL).  I'm very glad to have traded for it and was totally worth the asking price.  Would do it again. 701 characterseifster82, Nov 24, 2016

Reviewed as: American Double / Imperial Stout
Misc.: 2016 release; Bottled in June 2016; Bottle reads 11.2 pct. ABV
Was lucky enough to get two bottles of this on an online sale back in late-June. Had been saving them for a special occasion and decided to bring one over to Chris’s for a small share. Will be hard to live up to how good I think this one will be. As I tasted it, it was ranked No. 16 all-time on Beer Advocate (4.67) and 4.766 on Untappd. Super excited. 
Poured a black color with two fingers of frothy tan, spotty lacing. Excellent lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.25)
Smell was just ridiculous. Got milk cholate, chocolate syrup, vanilla, caramel, toffee, smooth bourbon, cocoa, boozy late with a deep breath and light tobacco. (Smell - 4.50)
Tasted not quite as good as the nose. Definitely much thinner. Chocolate milk syrup, cocoa, vanilla, toffee and caramel. Could hardly taste the 14.1 pct. (Taste - 4.25)
Full body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth warming finish. (Feel - 4.50)
This was a very good beer, but not quite legit in my opinion and definitely not worth $22.95 for a 500-ml. bottle. (Overall - 4.25)

On tap at BL. Big improvement over b2. Whatever they did with the vanilla this year was the right call. Perfectly nuanced really well balanced blend of bourbon barrels. Liked this slightly more than number crunch which covers up the vanilla but has a really nice nuttiness at the end. I guess it's just personal preference. I remember having VR a couple years ago and it just wasnt as balanced as this. Best use of vanilla in a beer I've ever had.
B2 bottle brought over by my generous brother and poured into 6 oz stone festival glasses. Drank cool but let open up for about 10 min.
This beer has some heat qualities that could be improved upon perhaps with age. I wouldn't call this a vanilla bomb. Vanilla rye is a vanilla bomb. Overall the mouthfeel comes off pretty thin and there is some heat in the background that disguises what vanilla there is. It's still a solid beer just lacking in the background. I had space trace on tap and that was way more complete and focused. Perhaps this was just a bad bottle but the alcohol could be better integrated for what I expect with the hype backing this beer. Would still love to get in the future. 1,164 charactersputonyourwalkingshoes, Nov 05, 2016

Appearance: Spinal Tap black. No head.

Taste: Vanilla and chocolate, but also burnt coffee. A little disappointing. 
Feel: Thinner than expected. Minimal carbonation. Hides 14% well.

The nose is really intense, tons of marshmallow and chocolate, rich bourbon, charred oak and a light roasted grain aroma, toffee, light bitterness but generally this beer is super sweet on the nose without being overly boozy. The flavors pop so well, chocolate like crazy, brownie batter, dark baker's chocolate, vanilla bean and marshmallow sweetness, smooth bourbon barrel, toffee and molasses with charred oak, chewy wood, roasted grain, brown sugar, a bit of coconut even with a lingering charred bitterness that cuts through the sweetness. The mouthfeel is perfection, smooth, chewy, coating, massive full body, rich and it finishes so easily with just a touch of alcohol warmth.
Verdict: A great Barrel-Aged vanilla stout from Bottle Logic. Rich and decadent, complex and exploding with flavor, very thick with a great full body and wonderfully balanced and layered flavors. Definitely worthy of the hype and an exceptional beer. 1,214 characterskevanb, Oct 16, 2016
4.56/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A little dissapointed by this one....pours medium black with a quick fading head.  Smell is off the charts.....huge vanilla, barrel, marshmallow, and chocolate.  Taste is dominated by vanilla.....the barrel, toffee sweetness, semi sweet chocolate, and malts all play in the background.  This is a sweet beer.....almost pickup an artificial sweetener aspect to it.  Body is on the thin side with medium carbs for the style.  Not sure that the feel can handle the sweetness level of this vanilla stout.  Great stout: yes.  Lives up to the hype: no. 546 characterslemmy187, Oct 16, 2016

4.73/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours pretty thick but once it sits in the glass there is still bits of light coming through around the edges with a khaki ring around the glass that lingers throughout. Smell is very boozy marshmallow bomb up front. Vanilla is there but there is more marshmallow. Taste is vanilla sweetness up front followed by the roast flavor of the base beer. The feel is a tad thin. Had this beer side by side with vanilla rye and found this beer to be one dimensional. Not in a bad wa just had less going in than vanilla rye. Excellent beer nonetheless. A vanilla barrel aged stout that keeps getting better as it warms. 610 charactersAmguerra305, Oct 15, 2016

The taste is milk chocolatey bourbon with an overly sweet vanilla finish. 
The feel is thinner than most barrel aged stouts in this category. 
Overall, this is a tasty beer. It lacks a bit of balance and attacks a bit too hard with the ABV heat as the beer warms, but it delivers on some excellent sweet vanilla and chocolate notes that many beers seem to miss entirely. 
Hopefully, this beer will become like Black Tuesday and become the excellent beer that everything is looking to get rid of in the trade market. Until then, I am happy with my one pour and feel no need to revisit in the near future. 685 charactersrodmanfor3, Oct 03, 2016

Aroma : Huge vanilla bomb in my face. Straight bourbon vanilla, oak, whiskey, malts, milk chocolate, dark chocolate. 
Mouthfeel : Medium low carbonation, medium bodied.
Flavor : warm alcohol at first, smooth vanilla and dessert like taste. Sweet, chocolate, caramrl. it finishes very dry but the chocolate flavor lingers on my tongue. Very satisfying.
Overall : this beer is nearly perfect. However, the mouthfeel is kinda thin, compared it's high alcohol. Big vanilla nose and very balanced flavor, recommend it. 551 charactersnerdboy19, Oct 01, 2016
4.4/5  rDev -5.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Many blessings upon thesinisterkid for sending this 500ML bottle to flyover country. Been lusting after this one for a while & now it’s mine. Mine! All mine! Until I piss it out, that is. Then it belongs to the Eagan Public Works Department. 
Black. Smells like the vanilla marshmallows left on the counter, & nobody noticed when somebody spilled a bit of Jim Beam on them. Plus chocolate. Not objectionable. At all. 
Fundamental Observation - it’s like going to your first Young Fresh Fellows concert - can’t possibly match up to the albums, right? Wrong. I can feel my cynical beer-reviewing self melting into a smiling nine year old with FO smeared all over my face. Big, real vanilla up front with a double-shot of bourbon & really, that’s all it needs. But wait…there’s more! Fudge, chocolate syrup, cream, roast, & warming alcohol that begins to addle my wits at sip #4. Thick, rich, this immediately reminded me of Zhukov’s & the bottomless malts of Cigar City stouts. I’d like to see how much of this I could drink before I fell off the couch. 
This beer is no This One’s for The Ladies, but it’s certainly superior to The Sounds of the Pacific Northwest. Brushes against the elite, but doesn’t quite have that hi-hat on a long piece of flexible pipe that would push it over the edge. Still an marvelous beer. 1,342 charactersmaximum12, Sep 30, 2016

poured o to a perfect stout
looks great in the glass, nice mocha head
smell is fantastic, vanilla upfront with nice sweetness and bourbon. some roasty notes
taste is fantastic, not overly sweet, but a big punch of vanilla. great bourbon. this is a well made beer. follow the nose exactly, roastiness sets it apart from vanilla noir
mouthfeel is a winner, no hi tid the 14% in the slightest
overall this might be the best vanilla stout I've had. I enjoyed vanilla noir, vanilla rye and vanilla eclipse a lot and this one takes the cake, I could easily finish a 750 of this, something I can't say about vanilla noir or vanilla eclipse. I can see why people go nuts for this, wish the hype was nuts so more people can try this
thanks for the chance Brian! 825 charactersKevSal, Sep 04, 2016

Smells like rich, dark fruit and the most amazing vanilla beans you've ever experienced.
Tastes like OG nilla. For 14%...even as it warms, there is no way you would guess that strength until it burns going down.
Feel is medium heavy, while nowhere being thin. 
Overall I am loving this brew, I can definitely see it getting better with age. If you're gonna complain about it being too vanilla forward, then don't drink an Imperial vanilla bb stout. 487 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Aug 14, 2016

Pours a deep brown nearly black body with a one finger brown head that reduces at a moderate rate to leave a ring of foam and little lacing. 
Aromas deepen as the beer gets warmer.. allowed to warm to room temperature where the bourbon aromas are at their most potent, marshmallow, lots of vanilla too, very nice.  Bourbon takes center stage with vanilla in a close seond. Chocolate and coffee are present as well. 
On the tongue.. wow - this is fantastic. Tons of vanilla and chocolate, liquid fudge and vanilla blondies, lots of bourbon as well, followed by sweet chocolate/vanilla liquor and a delicious roasty coffee on the follow through, finishing with a syrupy, rich sweet chocolate bourbon flavor. 
Mouthfeel is great, this is as rich as fudge, smooth and velvety as cake, and there's minimal alcohol burn for 14.1%. Low carbonation. 
Overall I was not disappointed by FO, this is fantastic and just as advertised. Hype is real yo. 1,051 charactersgcamparone, Aug 10, 2016

The head is a dark creamy tan and retains the perfect amount around the rim. The color is a dark dark brown, almost motor oil like, but not quite there. The smell is caramel, coffee, chocolate, and most of all vanilla. It's a killer amount of vanilla. Taste is so sweet at front with a to of chocolate and coffee afterwards to round it out. Mouthfeel is perfectly thick, and a touch of carb. Overall this beer is fantastic and a must have for anyone who enjoys this type of beer. But I like the Vanilla Medianoche better.

Pours a deep mahogany brown, essentially black. Aroma of intense bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, vanilla beans, and subtle roastiness. Taste reflects the smell. Amazing vanilla and bourbon flavors meld together perfectly that finishes abruptly with an oaky taste and a lingering roastiness. Feel is thick and sludgy. Overall this is a fantastic beer that is an absolute treat to drink. 421 charactersReema, Jul 16, 2016

Pours black but not that jet black, no light, kind of crazy dark I'd expect from a 14% monster. The smell is glorious! I cannot believe the liquid vanilla bean/cream scent that this gives off. The aroma destroys VR. Taste is just enough bourbon to blend with a great base stout and while it delivers more of that vanilla. I don't think the flavor has the in-your-face vanilla I seemed to hear so much about. Carbonated perfectly and the liquid coats your mouth with a tiny dance of bubbles and viscosity that isn't as thick as one may/may not expect. Overall, I cannot say hands down that this is a better beer than VR, but that's only because I'm comparing a 2oz pour of VR vs about half the bottle of FO. 788 charactersEyePeeAyBryan, Jul 13, 2016

Poured from a bottle on 6/28/16, then tasted again on draft at the release at Bottle Logic on 7/2/16.
A - Pours out an inky black, with a noticeable dearth of head. Bubbles dissipate into oily lace rather quickly.
S - The aroma holds the promise of so many Oreo Blizzards. A cornucopia of cookies'n'cream.
T - Up front, there is a readily noticeable heat from the alcohol, which slowly merges with the smooth, toasted velvet texture of the beer. The vanilla is omnipresent, and only grows sweeter as the beer warms. Bourbon skews toward the sweeter side.
M - Crazy smooth. The wood, vanilla, bourbon and the base beer coalesce to form the quality of a dense, drinkable cake doughnut.
O - This is indeed a world-class beer. If I had to rank a few recent BBA releases from BL, I'd go: Ground State > Fundamental Observation > Leche Borracho
While FO is worthy of the accolades... it is also the product of a young brewery with an ambitious barrel program. Bottle Logic simply doesn't have the capacity to produce a zillion gallons of FO on-demand. They're definitely working at managing the hype and trying to gauge and control it... but not always to the overwhelming approval of their zealous fans.  I look forward to their continued evolution as a key brewery in the OC / LA craft beer scene. 1,345 charactersRothobinide, Jul 09, 2016

This beer is so black, that it actually blocks out direct sunlight. No head to speak of, but thick legs stick around the glass. The aroma is absolutely wonderful, top notch! The intoxicating aromas of vanilla, bourbon, char, cocoa, are sweet and hide the booze well thus far.
The talk is well justified. Fundamental Observation is not only delicious, but deceiving. Flavors are remarkable, with notes including sweet bourbon, vanilla bean, chocolate, toasted marshmallow, licorice, charred malt. What's the alcohol on this? A pleasing buzz of booze only seems to penetrate onto the palate. It's full bodied, carbonation that feel suspended from the thick body, not boozy or any unpleasantness afterwards. 
Such great God water! It only takes one extraordinary beer to become a national celebrity nationwide. I knew Bottle Logic could crank out quality, but this is in another league. Awesome! 1,064 charactersDoubleJ, Jul 04, 2016

Pours a deep black with a thin ring of espresso colored foam. Smell is vanilla, oak, chocolate, caramel, and bourbon. The taste follows with a lot of vanilla marshmallow and sweet caramel flavor finishing with some great barrel notes. Not overly viscous but has a really nice full mouthfeel. 300 charactersSovereignGood, Jun 29, 2016

This beer is phenomenal and surely a treat. I was thinking this is a 4.99 / 5 but I cannot confidently say I find a stark noticeable flaw. It holds its own with Bourbon fucking county, parabola, Monsters Park Vanilla KBS, etc. (haven't tried Vanilla Bean Dark Lord though)
This beers is not over the top viscous but creamy, thick and hefty. There are a plethora of complex flavors mingling together before it finishes with a medium amount of creamy vanilla. Aftertaste is smooth and pleasant and the bourbon isn't wild or hot its perfect in my opinion. 
Bottle Logics stout game is fucking fire. They can't miss man. Ground State, Leche Borracho, Fundamental forces and darkstar are all epic winners. 845 charactersluisitoelmatador88, Jun 12, 2016

A- pours pitch black in color with a  small foamy khaki head that disappears immediately, leaving nothing behind, hints of light leaking out around the edge 
S- aroma is pure vanilla bean up front, fresh vanilla bean.  Underlying brings spicy bourbon, along with wood, vanilla & coconut. Just a hint of alcohol warmth on the finish.  It doesn’t get much better aroma for a vanilla stout 
T- sweet vanilla up front opens, with a bourbon presence quickly kicking in with notes of spicy barrel, coconut & caramel.  As it nears the finish, notes of raisin and prune kick in, with a linger of light vanilla  4.25
M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel that finishes with a bit of alcohol on the linger 
O- aroma was spot on, flavor was almost as solid, but couldn’t quite bring out the vanilla as it was in the aroma.  Still an outstanding beer 916 charactersTreyliff, Mar 31, 2016

Smells of vanilla and oak  
Taste is very much like marshmallow. The vanilla and bourbon barrel really turn this amazing stout into a world class treat. 
Mouthfeel is thick (creamy in a good way). It really grabs all your attention when taking a sip of this beer. 
Overall: Easily the best vanilla stout I have ever tried. 367 charactersAB_Inbev, Mar 14, 2016

Pours an almost black color with a slight tan head.  Right off the bat, you smell the huge amounts of vanilla on this one.  So much so that its almost all you smell.  The taste was vanilla upfront, followed with a whiskey finish. Slight coffee notes also, and a little chocolate.  Overall, this was very very good. The vanilla smell and taste was nice, but it was almost overwhelming.  Because the vanilla was so strong, I feel it did not blend as well with the other aspects of the beer.   Still.. certainly a treat to try. 540 characters-Rick, Mar 14, 2016

Smell is boozy with a hint of vanilla. Taste is smooth with bourbon up front and vanilla following. It gets much better as it warms. Make sure you drink this slow. It is significantly better warmed up. It's good but not worth its trade value. Don't give up the farm for this. OG vanilla is still the best vanilla stout. 333 charactersJFresh21, Mar 05, 2016

Coates the mouth and leaves you wanting more and more.  Maybe the best stout I've ever had the pleasure to have, all 6 of us doing the blind taste test were in agreement that this was the best by a long shot.
b2 - 2016
Look is a rich looking pour, thick and chewy, sweet barrel vanilla all over the place just on the pour. A burgundy/tan foam covers the top, very thin layer that clear in the middle and rests on the edges of the glass.  Even with a slight swirl of the glass, the tan foam bubble stick with the liquid around it and moves collectively, there is no mixing here, thickyicky is the only way to describe the look.  
The aroma is smores, all smores with a beautiful amount of barrel.  rich sweet chocolate and marshmallows, intoxicating.  The barrel is huge, but not 'hot' it might be the most intense barrel since Rare '15 or Ardea Insignis, except this trumps both with the rich sweet character vanilla. its perfect.
Taste is heavenly, again its like smores stuffed into bourbon barrels and then drinking the liquid that would sit at the bottom.
Mouthfeel is velvet vanilla/tiramisu cake, right out of the fridge after the pour it feels slightly thin compared to the pour/look, but let this it sit for awhile and the thickness prevails.
Overall I can confirm that this is one of the best beers ever made, absolutely a treat to revisit and would seek this out again and again and again. 1,551 charactersM_chav, Feb 06, 2016

From a 50cl bottle into a snifter
Vintage: 2015
Imperial stout blended with Madagascar vanilla beans and aged in bourbon barrels
Aged in 4 different barrels for 11 months
APPEARANCE: A clear black pour yields a one finger, medium looking, bubbly, dark tan head with decent retention. Black body with no real carbonation evident. Head fades to a bubbly half wisp with no lacing on the glass. A bubbly ring remains until the end but leaves no lacing down the glass as it empties. Good color but mediocre head. 
SMELL: Lots of vanilla and bourbon for sure. Oak, toffee, sweet cream, milk chocolate and a good dose of vanilla beans, which come off quite natural as opposed to artificial. Notes of pure chocolate as it sits. Bold with plenty of bourbon and alcohol as well. Outstanding. 
TASTE: Lots of vanilla beans up front again, with milk chocolate and bourbon flavors moving into the swallow. Oak and more vanilla show up, then a bold and lingering finish of milk chocolate, oak, bourbon, sweet cream, some bitter, pure chocolate all competing with the smooth vanilla beans that tie it all together. Flavorful and boozy, with lots of nice, natural vanilla character here. Really good. 
PALATE: Medium body with higher levels of carbonation for the style. Light and somewhat prickly on the palate, goes down a bit prickly with a scratch at the swallow and finishes sticky. Some heat lingers. It mellows as it sits but it's still more prickly than hoped. A bit too much carbonation as well. 
OVERALL: Great stuff. Really flavorful and forthcoming, with a more natural vanilla character than many others in this category, as some examples come across as artificial or extract based. The nose is outstanding as well, while the barrel aging works really well with the vanilla addition, adding lots of layers and nuances that are worth contemplating. The only knock on this one is that the feel is prickly and somewhat harsh, which detracts from the experience somewhat, but that's a minor issue that might even mellow with time. If this were a bit creamier and smoother, it'd be an epic brew. It's excellent as it is, and I was very happy to try this one out. Thanks again vanlingleipa. Very much enjoyed this one. 2,398 charactersJeffo, Feb 03, 2016

The vanilla blends wonderfully into the malts so it doesn't strike you right away as a vanilla brew or dominate the character. Same goes for the bourbon and barrel character, which creeps through the thick cocoa flavors. Though the bottle only holds .5L, I'd recommend splitting this among 3-4 people. It's delicious but quite thick, reminds me 3F Dark Lord. 497 characterstempest, Jan 30, 2016

The aroma shows a hint of barrel and vanilla but doesn't smack you in the face, like I like for a ba stout. The first sip is killer as this is very balanced. The vanilla is pure, its a great taste on the back end. Reminds me of an older faded original bcs vanilla. I wish the barrel was more present. This probably needed a month longer in the barrel (s). Barrel alcohol heat would have provided balance. Insanely drinkable for 14%. I'm nit picking on the lack of barrel presence, this is a great beer. 567 charactersjrallen34, Jan 10, 2016

You could smell the vanilla and barrel as soon as you open the bottle. A lot going on I was worried it might not blend well
Taste- holy shit was I wrong this beer is perfect a lot of vanilla, a little barrel some chocolate and roasted coffee

Look - pitch black, oily look.  Dark tan head with a very nice lacing on the glass.  Off to a great start!
Smell - this is where it really gets going.  Burst of vanilla and milk chocolate erupt from the glass, along with a little bit of booze from the bourbon.  Not overly complex, but it is not necessary with this amazing aroma.
Taste - and it continues to get better and better.  Vanilla bomb, but also a milky chocolate and bourbon bomb as well.  The flavors really all explode together in what comes together as one of the best flavors I have ever tasted.  There's a little hint of fudge and roastiness, but most just a superb balance of bourbon, milk chocolate, and vanilla...all of which are the best flavors of those categories I have ever had all piled into one taste.
Feel - phenomenal.  I could drink this as fast as water.  It went down so smooth with no booze whatsoever.  The thick liquid just coated my mouth.  Just amazing
Overall - simply amazing.  No crazy complexity here, but just an incredible combo of exquisite flavors.  I will seek out more of this and will likely try to travel to future releases if this becomes an annual beer. A++! 1,209 charactersrabbott2, Dec 30, 2015

F: Exceptional mouthfeel and carbonation that lingered throughout the tasting
O: Absolutely incredible sipper here; the alcohol is evident, but did not detract from the experience. I loved the vanilla notes and depth of the bourbon flavor. Overall this is an awesome brew and one I hope Bottle Logic brings back in the future. 664 charactersFireman_RK, Dec 27, 2015

S - An ungodly amount of vanilla and chocolate. Bourbon is taking a backseat to the vanilla, but it smells so good, it's forgivable. 
T - Liquid s'mores. Marshmallow and hot fudge with some brownies. The bourbon adds another layer of complexity. But seriously, this is just a carpet bomb of vanilla without being cloying.
F - Thick and viscous. Feels like Hersey's syrup. No alcohol to be detected and not even a warming sensation.
O - Hype has been exceeded. Adding vanilla to a big stout can make it taste like vanilla extract which then makes it sweet and sugary. The vanilla beans in this are genuine without being overdone. Without the barrel this would have been an elite dessert beer, but the addition of bourbon makes it arguably the best imp stout I've ever had. I never give out perfect scores, so this is special. 922 charactersThrewRedButter, Dec 06, 2015

4.77/5  rDev +2.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I was fortunate enough to be around when Bottle Logic released Fundamental Observation. Six bottles were available pp to the public that day, only because back in April, nobody knew what a monster this sucka would be like. Still, 2k bottles went faster than a gulp of water on a hot summer day.
So, I cracked open my first bottle since shortly after release last week. A very good beer then, it has morphed into an excellent brew.
The Madagascar Vanilla beanyness shows no sign of declining. The vanilla is still very warm (not in a 'hot' alcohol way) on the tongue, but doing a sublime job of merging with some of the other flavors like whiskey, dark fruit and chocolate. One negative back then - a slight bitterness - has all but disappeared.
In short, Fundamental Observation has come into it's own as a truly classic, barrel-aged stout.
Note: Do yourself a favor. Do not drink cold. Let the flavors, and especially the aroma, open wide. 946 charactersVanlingleipa, Nov 08, 2015

Nose has some serious vanilla in it, not really in a good way, gets a little messy and sweet, not really much malt aroma, maybe a hint of barrel.  Flavor is even sweeter, very little actual stout to this, almost exclusively vanilla and some woody barrel.  Heavy feel, syrupy, too much carb, oily finish.  Too me, this isn't beer, it was at one point but then vanilla was just poured into it to cover any actual beer aspect to it.  This doesn't take skill to produce. 524 characterscpetrone84, Oct 24, 2015

L: Jet black, more head that one would expect. Nice and thick as it pours, looks to be oily. 
S: Marshmallow, vanilla, and bourbon. Maybe a hint of roasted malt bitterness to cut through the sweetness, but really tempting; makes you want to drink it immediately. 
T: Just as the smell would lead you to believe: marshmallow, nuanced coffee and cocoa, and a really nice balanced bourbon presence. 
F: On par with Darkstar; chewy, thick, lingering, and very appropriate carb. 
O: Hard to pick between this one and VR, but I would absolutely seek this one out again. 610 charactersjolly_lynch, Oct 17, 2015

Aroma is massive vanilla, marshmallow, raisins, oak, chocolate, roast. Flavor follows the aroma with amazing vanilla notes that don't overpower everything, and allow the raisin/chocolate influence to come through alongside some roast and strong bourbon/oak tones. Thick bodied with medium low carbonation. Just fantastic here. Probably the best vanilla stout I've ever had. 470 charactersBMMillsy, Oct 01, 2015

4.85/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Small pour (about 2-3oz), little to no head. Vanilla and bourbon in the nose meshed well together, with vanilla being more dominant. Taste reminded me of Vanilla Rye, vanilla, chocolate, fudge, the usual, but nowhere near the sweetness, which puts this on a perfect 5/5 in term of taste for me. For a BA vanilla stout, this has the right mouthfeel, not super viscous or runny. 
This is definitely my favorite BA vanilla stout so far, above Vanilla Rye and 4 Hands Madagascar...and certainly way above BVDL. 507 charactersmythaeus, Sep 22, 2015

4.93/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5500mL bottle from j47paco (many thanks for this fantastic treat!). 2015 vintage, released 6/30/15. Served in a Three Floyds teku. 
Pours pitch black with a finger and a quarter mocha head. Some scant surface clouds and a thin halo lingers but no lace can find purchase on the glass. 
The aroma is incredible with an impressive amount of vanilla. Bourbon, oak, chocolate and caramel back up all the vanilla goodness. I can't keep my nose away. 
Flavors are rich, decadent and delightful. The huge vanilla promised by the nose is delivered in spades along with white chocolate, bourbon, fudge, wet oak, caramel, molasses, creamed coffee and an easy going but undeniable nip of booze. Dangerously smooth and easy to drink for an imperial stout topping 14% abv. Truly amazing how well the vanilla beans and bourbon barrel aging reinforce the outstanding vanilla top notes and carry it throughout the experience. 
Full, velvety feel with soft, smooth carbonation. The aftertaste is like bourbon fudge dripped over vanilla bean ice cream and the body is full enough to coat the tongue so it lingers for several minutes. Seriously the most incredible finish I've had. 
As a huge fan of vanilla I can't help but fall in love with Fundamental Observation. Bottle Logic has done a superb job nailing the flavor and putting it in a near perfect package. Hands down the best vanilla stout I've had as well as one of the best all around beers. For me this is near magical and I can't recommend highly enough trying it if you can. 1,521 charactersThickNStout, Sep 21, 2015

Pours an oily black, very similar to VR, however darker and oilier.  Aroma exploded with raw vanilla bean, rich dark chocolate stout with a slight pleasant soy sauce flavor, marshmallow, burnt dark roast, and more vanilla of all kinds.  Palate leads with tons of the vanilla and marshmallow sweetness to a great, deep stout-chocolate flavor and rich whiskey booziness.  Chewy, viscous, thick mouthfeel, which carried all the flavors well.  This reminded me of a more balanced and deeper Bourbon Vanilla Dark Lord.
Incredible stout worth the acclaim. 580 characterstimc100, Sep 10, 2015

4.71/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75For those of us who prefer out stouts served with a spoon and fork, the Bottle Logic offers a stout of epic porportions that are anything from either fundamental or logical.
But their lavish Fundamental Observation is just that. You don't really pour the beer, but rather simply open the top and let it crawl out all on its own. As it slowly nestles into the snifter, it does so with a lavish tar-like austere. A patient release of a thick mocha-stained blanket of foam is marshmallowy and firmly dense. Equally as lavish are the dessert-like aromas that swirl like walnut brownies dipped in madeira with an initial sip that's deeply saturating with dark chocolate, marshmallow cream and sweet booze.
Heavy and cake-like, the middle palate is awash with bittersweet chocolate, black-strap molasses, silky espresso, roasting walnut and heavy whipping cream- all in a soft and elegant vanilla wrap. Slow to resist any fade, its this combination that rides deep into the finish with a consistent and dedicated flavor spread; only allowing the tethers of bourbon, port and fruit, fortified madeira wine to weave into the sweetness and pulling the taste togethers.
Any full-bodied claim would be an understatement as the ale wraps around the tongue like brownie batter. Its tawny, tangy and simmering alcohol warmth embraces the lightly cloying sweetness and invites much more of a savory sipping affair than in the promotion of anything drinkable or quick. Its flavors are long and lingering reaching deep into the next sip. Its a stout that's not a pairing for dessert, it replaces dessert altogether. 1,601 charactersBEERchitect, Sep 08, 2015

Thick viscous black with a dark khaki head.  Nose is jammed packed with vanilla and sweet cocoa, coffee and chocolate.
Taste follows the nose except that in addition to all those wonderful flavors you'd swear that your drinking liquid fudge with a nice carb and bitter sweet chocolate tones.
This is first rate. 520 charactersGRG1313, Aug 23, 2015

Pours a dark black body, shades of brown, one finger brown head that dies down fairly quickly, leaving a thin collar. Not a whole lot more to say about the appearance; it's very typical for a big stout. Smell is vanilla, graham crackers, whiskey, oak, milk chocolate, more whiskey. It's very akin to Bourbon County Vanilla Rye, which is not surprising. Vanilla-forward aromas mixed in with whiskey. Flavour is vanilla bean, whiskey, oak, milk chocolate, a bit of roasted malt in the background. It's quite vanilla forward, but not cloying or sweet. Slight char. Mouthfeel is full bodied, substantial, slightly boozy but still quite restrained for a 14.3% stout. Reasonably drinkable, remains a bit of a sipper. Overall, this is pretty much Vanilla Rye. Thick chewy body with vanilla and whiskey all-around. 847 charactersStevedore, Aug 19, 2015

A cartoonishly large burst of vanilla jumps out of the glass, followed by caramel / toffee / panna cotta, marshmallow. I'd like a bit more oak, something to round out the dessert nose. The flavor is more balanced than I expected adding a good dose of milk chocolate, bourbon, hint of oak. Not cloyingly sweet or forcing the viscosity with residual sugars. Though VR continues to improve with age, this felt a bit more lithe and far more drinkable. 469 charactersKurmaraja, Aug 18, 2015

The flavor was not the vanilla bomb I had expected based on other reviews. I thought overall a very solid beer that could've gone further with the vanilla and tasted comparably to a bcbs, maybe a bit better.
Second try: waaaay better. Must be bottle variation. Vanilla forward this time around and close to perfect. 381 characterslinnymtu, Aug 09, 2015

The aroma is astounding! Luscious sweet vanilla, caramel, chocolate, smooth bourbon, and wonderful oak presence! The only thing preventing a perfect score is a slight astringentcy.
The flavor is equally impressive! Wave on wave of vanilla, but not overly sweet. Marshmallow, caramel, a lot of bourbon presence, and hints of dark bitter chocolate. The slight astringency from the aroma is also present.
Thick, viscous, mouth coating, and a bit of alcohol heat.
This beer is the real deal! I'm very glad I got my hands on a bottle! 631 charactersSadMachine, Aug 03, 2015

Look: pitch black and viscous, faint ring of cinnamon-colored head. 
Smell: vanilla and bourbon. Don't get a lot of other classic BA stout notes (roast, coffee, chocolate, oak).
Taste: follows the nose, but with more coconut, milk chocolate, coffee. The booze is smooth, not at all harsh. 
Feel: medium, but surprisingly light for the style. Silky, and pretty dry finish. 
Overall: it's good and I'm glad to have tried it, but the people trading away their firstborn for it could just splash a little nice bourbon and some good vanilla extract a into a solid stout and get 90% of the experience with way less trouble. 665 charactersneurobot01, Jul 27, 2015

Simply AMAZING. Very well balanced by the roast. Just tooo good. Overall the best damn barrel aged vanilla IRS I've ever had.

The taste was impressive.  Plenty of vanilla and the barrels blended quite well and a few of us mentioned noticing more then 1 barrel being involved FWIW.  Multi-faceted BA stout with vanilla and the barrels being the highlights.
Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, not as viscous as others and as much as I would have liked, but definitely not thin. Less thick then BCBS or CCB or Cycle but not by much.
Overall, this was very good and I'm glad I have another. Aside from bumping up the thickness you couldn't improve this much for me. 701 charactersBeer4B, Jul 22, 2015

Incredible color and smell to this beer. Decent mouthfeel and a bit sweet to taste. BL must have used a ton of Vanilla Beans... Not as much bourbon as I was expecting, but still enough to let you know its there. 
At the end of the day, people (including myself) are trading some high caliber beer for FO... Is it worth the hype? No, but it is a really good beer. Vanilla Rye killer, as its been called? Absolutely not. 
Overall, well done Bottle Logic. 539 charactersSDwomp, Jul 19, 2015

Beautiful pour with minimal head, the vanilla reaches the nose before you even go to smell it. 
Taste matches the nose with and provides a perfect bourbon-marshmallow linger. 
Mouthfeel is spot on and gets better with each sip. Truly worth the hype. 304 charactersTeddy_Hopper, Jul 19, 2015

My first impression was that this tastes like a maple creamsickle (if there was such a thing). Huge maple and vanilla aromas and flavors. Chocolate is present but, takes a bit of a backseat. Thick and silky smooth texture. Compares favorably to a certain vanilla stout from Chicago. World class without a doubt. 352 charactersFurlinator, Jul 16, 2015

Beautiful chocolate-milk, one-finger, creamy topping. Super sweet, marshmallow/vanilla/bourbon aroma. Very sweet, sticky and vanilla-y bourbon taste. Seemed to mellow as it warmed even though the alcohol became a bit more perceptible. Overall a very nice stout with a great vanilla flavor and enjoyment factor. I'd seek this out again, for certain. I've never poured a stout over ice cream as I've heard others do, but I'm betting this one would be the one to do it with# 541 characterspkalix, Jul 16, 2015

So I'm glad I got a chance to try this beer on tap, I'm a huge Bourbon County fan but did not care for BCBVS or VR(but have like other vanilla beers) so I was afraid big, over the top vanilla beers weren't for me.
So the beer poured nice and black, almost no head. Carbonation was perfect, no swirling required for me. Mouth feel was medium thickness, not as viscous as Bourbon County but it was not lacking by any means. 
Good bourbon and great vanilla. Doesn't seem overdone as some have said. Good stuff, I'll be sure to seek it out if it goes on tap again. 622 characterswhiskey, Jul 16, 2015

....Joking. Seriously, this beer is legit. It pours like a thin motor oil with not much of a head. The aroma on this is fabulous. I near gave it a 5 but I realize that Vanilla can work wonders, and in some ways is kinda cheating, but no joke, this beer smells wonderful. The taste is excellent. I had read all the hype and issues with the release and was expecting a beer that was overrated but this is legit. For me, I'm not into sweet beers but this has a nice balance between just enough sweetness and that barrel presence I like in BA beers. It's not over the top in any way except perhaps the vanilla but that's a good thing in this case.  I kept going back for more but enjoyed just letting this beer linger. The mouth feel is solid. Nice carbonation. If it was any more viscous this beer would be close to perfect. Overall, I think FO deserves the hype. I've read and heard comparisons to BC Vanilla Rye but I thought it was different than VR in that VR had more of a marshmallow taste and this is straight up vanilla bean. Both excellent beers but if I had to choose I would go with FO. 1,250 charactersDCLAguy11, Jul 10, 2015

4.99/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Believe the hype! I was one of the lucky few that was able to get one of the last pours today at their tasting room in Anaheim. Out of every single factor about this beer, I just want to simply focus on the taste the most since this is what set this beer apart from other BA stouts. The vanilla in this beer is powerful and hits you all the way from the front of your mouth all the way to the back of your throat. So if you absolute hate vanilla then this beer is most likely not for you. Just everything you want in a BA Vanilla Stout. Bottle Logic did not skimp out on the vanilla beans for this one and it does not take away from its other great characteristics such as the bourbon. If you're lucky enough to get this via trade or purchase, make sure to appreciate every single sip. Its truly a perfect beer and lives up to all the hype. Cheers! 848 charactersmakeyourself, Jul 04, 2015

The beer smells delicious.  Vanilla and chocolate fill the nose with the sting of booze on the back end.  The taste is not quite what I was hoping for.  It was a but muted based on the nose and a little more booze than I would prefer. The mouth feel is just slightly thinner than I would imagine but not far from the likes of GI.   Although I had this beer at same share as SR71 and Prop and BA MT w/ Cocoa and Coconut this beer a tier below the SR and Prop (IMO) but on par with the MT.  The only reason I mention this is because this beer is getting quite the hype and being compared to some of the best.  I have now had this beer in the bottle and on tap.  I'm not buying the hype. 773 charactersT_Hass, Jul 02, 2015

This has got the best vanilla presence I've tasted in a beer; enough boldness that seems like the beans are jumping on your tongue, but not overbearing that it becomes medicinal. Once the vanilla rushes through, the nutty, roasty stout crawls over your taste buds and takes its time. The bourbon barrel shines all the way through.
Overall, prob the best vanilla brew I've ever had and one of the best stouts I've had. 499 charactersRollzroyce21, Jul 02, 2015

The nose was outstanding; aromas of marshmallow, vanilla beans, cocoa nibs, bourbon, and oak are present throughout the beer. Fundamental Observation tastes similar to the smell of the beer, featuring flavors that resemble a chocolate covered marshmallow, that's dipped in bourbon, with a very nice oak undertone. The mouthfeel is thick and heavy bodied with a long, vanilla-esque finish. I thought that this was on par, if not better than Vanilla Rye. Thanks to Bottle Logic and Eureka Burger for putting out one of the best beers I've had in a while. 100/100 798 charactersbjmartin14, Jul 01, 2015

Thick, lush, syrupy mouthfeel with an abundance of flavor in every sip.  The flavor of vanilla comes over strong with zero medicinal flavor what so ever.. 
The bourbon barrel is perfect on this...   Sweet, dark chocolate, VERY CARMEL like taste... Overall there is zero burn on this beer and hardly tastes like 14%.
This beer will age great but is also READY TO DRINK NOW!
Aftertaste on this beer is fantastic..  Minutes after taking a sip the dark chocolate, vanilla, carmel and bourbon flavor coats your teeth with strong long lasting flavor of dessert mouthwash.

Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, bourbon, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa powder, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, bourbon, and wood flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with perfect bourbon barrel aged stout aromas and fantastic flavors that make this one a treat to drink.

I was really really impressed during the Bruery anniversary and then I opened a bottle yesterday. There's TONS of vanilla. It makes the beer sweet and super silky smooth, but not too sweet like DL or some Bruery stouts. It is a little fresh&hot right now, so I'm sure it will be more mellow and even more drinkable with time. The vanilla should last years as well, but don't get me wrong it's fantastic as it is right now. Great job Bottle Logic! 569 charactersgrze, Jun 03, 2015
