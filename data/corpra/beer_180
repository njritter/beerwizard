3.75/5  rDev -15.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75Poured into a snifter.  Bottle dated 23 02 18 with 03-15 on cork.  
3.75 A:  Ruddy plum color.  Less than a 1/2 finger of head forms with an aggressive pour.  No real lacing is left.
3.75 S:  Sweet and fruity.  Not a whole lot of funk or acid.  Cherries and cranberries stand out brightest.  The raspberry is a bit more subdued underneath.  Tons of vanilla and oak.  Biscuity malts with some breadiness and a hint of graininess.  
3.75 T:  Like the nose, the fruits are the focus.  The raspberry joins the cherry and cranberry in strength.  Tart, but more so from the fruits than from the bacteria.  It's definitely not puckering.  Just a touch of woody funkiness.  Again there lots of vanilla and oak, with just a hint of tannic astringency.  Malts are mostly neutral with bready aftertaste.
3.75 M:  Medium body.  Good moderate carbonation that gives it a pleasant fluffiness.  Lightly creamy and super smooth with a woody finish.
3.75 D:  Definitely a solid beer, but I don't know that I understand the hype.  Great fruity taste, but not overly impressive in the funk column. 1,083 charactersDavoleBomb, Mar 24, 2017

Cork and cage bottle dated 21 02 18 at 42 degrees into a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.  Opens with a resounding “POP”.  There is no foaming.  Served between 45 -54 degrees.
Aroma – definite raspberries and cherries.  As the brew warms, the aromas mull into a nonspecific berriness.
Head average (Maximum 3.7 cm, aggressive pour), tan with a pinkish cast, fizzy and dense, rapidly diminishing to a three mm ring and thin partial layer.
Lacing – none.
Body – a muddy brown with reddish tinges.  Bottle conditioned so OK.
Flavor – Begins slightly sweet with the cherries and raspberries predominating.  Ends with some cranberry and oak tartness.
Palate – light, dry, lively carbonation.
I believe I’ve mentioned before that the only berries of which I am a fan are cran and blue.  Normally I find raspberries too sweet and I just don’t like the taste (or all the stinking little seeds).  However, since this was a Rodenbach product, I figured it would be pretty good.  It is.  I could drink this all day.

Beautiful presentation (the appropriate glassware helps here), with a pinkish white head over a hazy red-copper colored body. The color does suggest fresh pressed red cherries. 
The rich aroma is tart and fruity with a pronounced cherry note and hints of ripe berries.. 
Flavor: tart and fruity with lots of sour cherry and hints of berries and ripe, pitted fruits. A brief bit of sweetness up front.

L: Deep ruby in color, slight head dissaptes quickly.
S: Sour cherries and raspberries with a slight earthy funk.
T: Same as the nose, but definite cranberry flavor comes through with a pleasant, slightly bracing tartness.
F: More dry than I anticipated, compliments the flavor.

Pours the color of genuine fruit, very similiar looking to New Glarus' Serendipity but perhaps a bit less fizzy. Fruit leather dull red with hues of bright pink poking through when it's held up to light.
Smells delicate and very smooth. Fruit has greatly dulled the bacterial sharpness and left behind a juicy melange that's more sweet than sour.  Cherry juice and light cranberry tartness weave their way against the mature, yeasty lambic.
Tastes almost the same as it smells: just as delicate but somehow more intense?  The flavor is more assertive but never really all that assertive, and the beer's genius is found in its otherworldly complexity. Lightly tart up front, moving into mixture of ripe and sweet red fruit and ending just a wee bit bitter, tart, and yeasty.  Pretty much flawless. 904 charactersmynie, Jan 07, 2017

S: Fruity, cherry scent, with musty tartness. 
T: Delicious balance of tartness and fruitiness like you almost only get with Rodenbach. Faint oak flavor, not heavy at all. I can't pick up the cranberry flavor, but the raspberry and cherry is apparent. 
M: A little heavy, I guess from the higher alcohol, but pretty drinkable.

S:  Smells of cherries and raspberries with some nice sourness and a hit of oak.  I just want to keep smelling this beer.
T:  Taste is tart cherry up front with raspberries, cranberries and a little oak.  Slight funk but decent tartness throughout.  The fruits do provide some sweetness to counter it though.  Swallow is slight cherry cough syrup with lingering raspberries and oak.  
M:  This beer is on the lighter side of medium in mouthfeel with slightly prickly carbonation and a semi dry finish.
O:  This is everything I love about the standard offering from Rodenbach with additional layers of flavor and complexity.  This is absolutely phenomenal and one to get your hands on if you can.  It's expensive but it's worth it. 860 charactersSHODriver, Dec 05, 2016

5/5  rDev +12.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5It's a little more specialized than just a Flander's Red, but for what it is, here goes:
Pours a nice reddish brown with decent carbonation.
Rich Flander's style aroma with a good cherry/cranberry scent to it.
Taste starts as a standard Flander's sour, but then cherries hit immediately and switch to cranberries effortlessly to finish with a tart cranberry style flavor.  Still a Flander's Red, but the fruit melds in seamlessly.
Mouthfeel is spot on with perfect body and carbonation.
Overall just a great beer and one that will be well received by those who like the sour fruit beers.  Worth it. 598 charactersgman1602, Sep 26, 2016

The taste is much more complex fruity tartness, light oak, grain, astringent from the cranberries, a bit sour but not much for the style. Balanced as hell this is drinkable as no other flander red ale. This beer goes beyond beer definition, it let you apprehend as far beer can go, and as they discribed it has the delicacy and power of a fresh Burgundy wine 426 charactersBruno74200, Jul 09, 2016

Taste is similar to the aroma.  Nice jammy berries; each berry is distinguishable on its own yet they are well balanced without overpowering the flavor of the other berries. Mellow oak profile and a decent amount of sweet malts present as well. Brown Sugar and light cinnamon spice. Mild to moderate sourness. Medium bodied beer with low carbonation. Easy drinking sour beer; it wasn't as sour as i was hoping it would be, but that did not take away from the overall enjoyment of this beer. Well this is easily the best Flanders Red that I have ever drank. Glad to finally get the chance to drink this as its been on my wants list for far too long. 744 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jun 29, 2016

It wasn't as sour as I expected, but on the positive side the acidity was low and the lecto wasn't crazy high (could be good or bad depending on what you're looking for). In my mind, I expected a bit more funk from the bugs and because of that, my rating is a bit lower than some others. 
Fruits were very nice, deep reddish/purple hue is nice and the finish is pretty clean. 
Overall, a solid hot Florida day sour that will quench your thirst due to it being very crisp with a small funk to keep it interesting. 648 charactersyumbeer, Jun 18, 2016

S: Amazing bursts of tart cherries, raspberries, and cranberries with a light acetic acid touch. Very light vinegar, leathery tannins, and some oak come through as well. Quite dominated by the fruit, however
T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the tart cherries and cranberries and slowly works its way into the raspberries. The light acetic tartness underlies everything, along with some oak and tannins. The sweetness of the fruits rounds out the tartness quite a bit, although it is slightly puckering at first. Finishes with lingering tart notes and fruitiness
M: Medium bodied with moderate, spritzy carbonation. Slightly drying
O: I'm surprised at how much this focuses on the fruit, but I'm not complaining one single bit because it's fucking great. The lactic notes aren't overwhelming in any sense, and still let the base and fruitiness shine through in full color. Well worth the coin 969 charactersBEERMILER12, May 14, 2016

This beer has a deep, burnt red hue with decent head that slowly fades out. In some aspects it reminds me of New Glarus's Raspberry Tart or Belgian Red with the sweetness dialed back significantly and paired with a counterbalance of sourness. Definitely a lot going on in the flavor profile levels with incoming waves of smooth sweet, then sour, followed by bitter. I don't know if I would go searching for another bottle but it was very interesting and worth a try if you have not before. 575 charactersTrevor11, Mar 27, 2016

The beer pours beautifully in the glass with a dark red-brown "oak" - color. Hazy with a thin head. 
Nose: Soft, sweet, tart nose of cherry, ripe apple, prune, oak, vanilla, raspberry and earthy yeast. I’m in love!
Taste: Ooooohh! So good! Raspberry, cherry, green apple, lemon, red berries, vinegar, oak and cranberry. Fantastic! 
Mouth-feel: Full body. High but smooth carbonation. Sour, tart mouth with a great dry ending. Complex structure. 
Conclusion: This is a beer of a lifetime! Totally blow my mind! So complex, tart, funky, smooth, sour, sweet.... well it’s LIFE! 
Happiness and love in a bottle! 
In this totally rush of life itself have to put down this review... It’s not easy but somebody has to do it... 835 characterscraftbeersweden, Mar 27, 2016

Smell and taste are both wonderfully integrated fruit with the cherries coming out stronger than the rest but it's pretty much the perfect amount of fruit (not overpowering) on top of a great base Flanders.  Probably the best Flanders I've ever had. 340 charactersDactrius, Mar 09, 2016

Aroma has lots of tart cherry & raspberry along with distant oak & earthy yeast. Undertones of grape must and strawberry. Tart upfront, but not a lactic / vinegar sourness, but prickly fruit tartness. Notes are primarily tart cherry with some of the other fruit notes lingering as well. Oak is very present as well, but it helps undercut some of the tartness which in turn compliments some of the earthier notes. Overall it is one of the best sour fruit beers you can find, bursting with interlacing flavors, and finishes clean & delicately. 641 charactersajm5108, Feb 29, 2016

4.42/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.25Consumed on February 9th, 2016 from an undated corked and caged bottle that was at least a couple of years old.  Poured into a tulip.
Beer is a thick and murky brown at first pour.  A nice one-finger head rises up quickly and fades away nearly as fast, leaving nothing behind, not even a modest ring.  Eventually, the beer cleared up in the glass and was a deep translucent shade of red-violet.
Aroma is tart and funky with berry notes and red wine vinegar base.
Flavor is sweeter and more subtle than nose, thank goodness!  Delicious berry bouquet caresses the palate, mingling with restrained acidic sourness.  Wood character floats in the background, providing a subtle touch of earthiness and bitterness.  Just fantastic.
Mouthfeel is a but still and could have really benefited from higher levels of carbonation.  Medium bodied and unremarkable otherwise.
This is a great beer and I love it, but a whole 750ml bottle to oneself is a monumental task. 959 characterscharlzm, Feb 11, 2016

Rodenbach Caractère Rouge
Flanders Red Ale – 7% - 750ml bottle – Best Before 09.09.17
Appearance: Red, oak colored, white head covering top of beer. Served in stemmed Rodenbach grand cru glass. Small, champagne style bubbles.
Aroma: Strawberry bon-bons, sherbert, just a hint of balsamic vinegar - faint compared to the grand cru. Also slightly acidic smell but mostly the red berries coming through in the aroma.
Taste: Sweets, red fruit and sherbert up front, funky in the middle and slightly sour - not as much as I would have thought, with a very long, dry finish. Absolutely wonderful. The three stages I describe above are very distinct and individual. 
Mouth feel: The label says about the triangle of sweet, sour and dry, and that is exactly what you get here. Very interesting to feel it evolve from one phase to the next on the palate. 
Overall: I love this! Not a beer that I could drink all the time but one that when you do fancy one, nothing else would do. Love the sherberty fruit mixed with sour funk and dry finish. A very unique example of a unique style. Looks very nice in the stemmed Rodenbach glass. 9.5 / 10. 1,158 charactersMrDell, Jan 29, 2016

Pours a mild fizzy pinkish smaller head that fades at a med to quicker pace, crystal clear ruby dark cherry red color.
Nose is nice, starting with lots of fruit, berry , various berries like black berry raspberry boisenberry thing, plenty of sour cherry as well and a bit of cherry cough syrup, nice sour funk little lacto pedio blend thing going on, some vanilla barrel notes, faint cranberry as well., a bit sweet and jammy.
taste comes on with tons more fruit again, fairly tart, and pretty sour, some lacto flemmy creamy sour, pedio funk sourness as well, fair acidity with acetic maybe also lactic acid. Plenty of fruit, sour cherry all over, mixed with more of that hodge podge berry but more of a dominant blackberry/raspberry combo, and even a touch of tart cranberry on the back end, a fleshy dry cranberry and not juice I mean like really chewing on the berry itself. Touch of vanilla oak barrel notes, with a sticky sweet candy malt character, jammy fruit and candy syrup like a nice tart fruit preserve. Finish is sticky and flemmy, a bit drier and a big cranberry flavor and dryness washing over, with a little sour cherry, and mild acidity.
Mouth is med bod, nice effervescent carbonation, little sticky, flemmy and sour. 
Overall quite nice, great souring aspects, nice base sweet candy malt, tons of great jammy tart fruit, good acidity levels, very tasty and enjoyable. 1,460 charactersjlindros, Jan 10, 2016

A: The beer is a deep ruby red color, with a thin pink head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains tart raspberries and cranberries, light caramelized malts and light Belgian yeast.
T: The taste likewise starts out with strong tart flavors of raspberries and cranberries. The tartness leans toward the sweeter side. The malt character is thin but complementary and brings a good balance. The after-taste is very tart.
M: Smooth and very crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is dry and clean.
O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style. 809 charactersTheManiacalOne, Jan 03, 2016

4.65/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Bottle poured into small tulip-shaped stemmed glasses (not technically tulips, but close enough).  Pours a deep ruby grapefruit red with a brownish tinge - a marginal head forms on pouring and dissipates almost immediately.  The nose on this beer is mind-blowing, arguably the best on any beer I've tried to date.  The sour cherry and cranberry come through strongly on the nose, but in a way that is accented with vinegar.  The nose here is hard to describe adequately, it's beautifully complex in its layering of tart fruits and vinegar.  The palate opens with sour cherry and balsalmic vinegar, and progresses to slightly sweeter, but nonetheless tart raspberry.  Mouthfeel is medium to thin.  Not quite as thick as Flanders reds like Duchesse (and a slightly thicker mouthfeel might have benefitted this beer) but good nonetheless.  Overall, and exemplary tweaking of Rodenbach's tried and true formula - a exceptional beer.
Tried twice more since the initial sampling described above.  An exceptional modification of the underlying beer, though one that has had a little more variation bottle to bottle than I would have anticipated.  The first, as above, was sweeter than the latter two.  The second carried a strong grape note.  The third (on tap), had a stronger presence of the more traditional Flanders Red notes (such as balsalmic vinegar). 1,352 charactersLAp, Dec 30, 2015

Smells like sour cherries. Really inviting.
Taste consists of cherries and berries, and it's sour, but not overly so. As another reviewer remarked, it is a lot like a sour version of a New Glarus fruit beer. I'm not picking up on the oak or vanilla, although I know those are flavors are in there. Anyway, this tastes really balanced. 
Beer goes down easy for a Flanders and is nice and crisp.
Overall, I have to deduct some points for the expensive price of this, and because of the price I doubt I'll ever have it again. But if you're into sours, this is one absolutely worth trying once. 687 charactersDeFaz, Dec 22, 2015

The color is a very attractive reddish-purple with a thin, milk-white head and minimal lacing.  I think there would have been a better head if it were poured from a bottle at a warmer temperature.  It is very aromatic with cherries, cranberries, and vanilla.  The taste starts out very sweet with abundant cherry, cranberry, and oaky vanilla but suddenly turns quite sour and acidic.  It's two distinct tastes but they blend really well.  This ale is medium-bodied and quite well carbonated.  At 7% ABV, it is very easy to drink.  Overall, it is a very tasty and enjoyable ale.  It is very-well crafted and has a unique taste. 717 charactersMacMalt, Dec 19, 2015

S-The smell is full of the sour cherries and a hint of cranberries.
T- Taste is very prominently lacto and sour cherries. The hint of cranberries comes in at the very end. This beer finishes very dry leaving you craving another sip. The tartness is strong, but not overpowering. Certainly not a gateway beer on that front.
F-the mouthfeel is fairly light. The carbonation is medium which along with the dry finish makes it a really nice brew.
O-A really enjoyable sour ale. Not a gateway to sours but one that can really be appreciated by those who are fans of the style. Well done Rodenbach. 710 charactersNotAlcoholicJustAHobby, Dec 13, 2015

4.35/5  rDev -2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours a very hazy dark garnet red in color with light to moderate amounts of active visible carbonation along the edges of the glass and moderate purplish/wine + amber highlights. The beer has a quarter finger tall fizzy foamy beige head that reduces to a couple of small patches of very thin film and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Minimal amounts of lacing are observed.
S: Moderate aromas of tart cherries, cranberries, and tart raspberries with moderate aromas of oak + vanilla. Light notes of vinegar-like acidity.
T: Upfront there is a moderate to slightly stronger flavor of fruit - cranberries, raspberries, and cherries which are moderately tart with a light amount of sweetness. That is followed by moderate flavors of oak + vanilla from the barrel aging and a moderate amount of tartness/sourness. Hints of vinegar-like acidity.
M: Light to medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Light to moderate amounts of acidic prickliness. 
O: Very enjoyable with a nice amount of complexity to the flavor and aroma - slightly more fruit forward than others in the style and the barrel flavors really come through. Definitely one to grab and I'm glad I got to try this one. Alcohol is very well hidden and the flavors are quite approachable. 1,269 charactersdbrauneis, Dec 12, 2015
4.37/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A: The beer is very hazy reddish purple in color.  It poured with a short white head that died down, leaving lots of wispy lacing on the surface and a tight collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Light to moderate aromas of cherries, cranberries, and oaky vanilla are present in the nose.
T: The taste follows the smell, starting off with a mix of flavors of cherries and raspberries and subtle bits of sweetness and vanilla from the oak barrel aging, but these are contrasted by a little bit of sourness.
M: It feels light- to medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.  The sourness lends some tartness, but the oak barrels also round out the mouthfeel, making it also seem somewhat smooth.
O: I really enjoyed this Flanders Red Ale.  It seemed to be fruitier and have more vanilla compared to some of the other beers I've had in the style,

4.52/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a cloudy dark ruby red color with copper/mahogany edges and a one finger pinkish, off-white head that quickly settles into a lasting ring. Spotty lacing left behind.  Beautiful color in this beer.  
Sweet vinous aroma with luscious fruit, acetic acid and a strong barrel presence.  Decent amount of oak but not overpowering with delicate char.  No toothpick character which is surprising given it aged in oak for two years.  Strong acetic acid but more of a vinaigrette sweetness, not harsh or solvent-like.  Lots of luscious fruit juice. The cranberry and sour cherries really stand out countering the acid and barrel with a really pleasant juicy fruit presence.  Smells incredible.  
Tart and puckering with the perfect balance of sour acidity, earthy oak and vinous fruit sweetness.  Subtle funk and acetic acid but again, it not solvent-like, providing mostly vinegary sweetness.  Some dark malt flavors in there along with prominent vinous dark fruit.  Tart cranberry and sour cherry really stand out along with other dark berries.  Well balanced and surprisingly drinkable considering the complexity and sour acidity.  Subtle mineral flavor and somewhat kriek like with dry fruit skins, jammy seeds and sweet fruit juice. 1,235 characterscorby112, Nov 23, 2015

This one pours a mostly clear dark red, it looks like so much fruit was jammed into this one. There's a very small head and no lacing.
Smells like the pulpiest and juiciest fruit ever, with cherry and cranberry leading the way, with raspberry not quite as strong but still there. I don't get much in the aroma other than pure fruit, but that's ok, because it smells delicious. This is slightly briney, but definitely not in a bad way. There's a bit of damp wood, and a sourness of about 3/10. Not a whole lot of fun, just a really great and vibrant expression of fruit. 618 charactersGreesyFizeek, Nov 22, 2015

Really wasn't much head on the pour I was given, and my efforts to rebuild it with swirls of the glass were unsuccessful. That said, mouthfeel was really nice and it balanced on a divide between creamy and prickly from the carbonation, which I found really appealing. Nice level of tartness, not overpowering or mouth puckering but definitely present enough to let you know you're drinking a sour. One thing I'd improve on, it was a bit sweet for my taste. Some residual tackiness on the palate and my lips made me wish for something just a touch more astringent. 635 charactersdd43, Nov 20, 2015

I love the Duchesse De Bourgogne and this was even better than it, because of the fruit flavor and the subtle nuances of the wood and yeast notes!
Nice red pour to this, which had the appearance of the fruits that were macerated in the making of this. Not a lot of head and whatever lacing was left slid down the side of the tulip glass that I drank this out of. Tons of tart raspberry in the nose, with even more in the taste. Nothing artificial here - this had a juicy mouthfeel to it but not syrup to be found and the barrels that this was aged in really came through in the taste, without any harsh smoke getting in the way. Felt like champagne and was just as light in it in the aftertaste, but the other fruits came through in a nice way by rounding out the initial "pucker" that I felt.
Not a session beer but really, would you even notice or care? I would have had more had I not gone up right before last call and it's a beer like this that made me fall in love with Flanders Red Ales all over again. Amazing on tap and so easy to drink - hopefully, someone here in the states will get on the ball with this style and give it a go. Something like this deserves an answer that can attempt to measure up to it. Wonderful stuff! 1,350 charactersJerzDevl2000, Nov 18, 2015

Looks like cranberry juice and bloodied urine; the smell is of pickled strawberry, cherry, bubblegum and SweeTarts candy. Taste follows nose, with a more pronounced sweetness that makes me like Grand Cru better. Mouthfeel is a little thin and drinkability is high. Great, unusual beer- if only the syrupy sweetness was tamed.. 397 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Nov 14, 2015

Very smashable up front and too easy to drink too fast.
Then the complexity hits and you are faced with a mix of cherries, raspberries, plums, and hint of vanilla.

Smell: A tangy-scented, sweet-n-sour aroma with an earthy, slightly woody undercurrent. You get your raspberries and cherries, thankfully without that occasional medicinal vibe you encounter.
Taste: A nice, inviting, juicy berry melange stirred up with a goodly splash of lemonade with a thin vein of twangy balsamic vinegar and very subtle oak accents. Tart, semi-dry, cranberry cocktail finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation.
Overall: Easily approachable, refreshing fare. 603 charactersChainGangGuy, Nov 04, 2015

Look: darker, browner, and less translucent than expected. Basically no head despite vigorous pour.
Smell: cranberries, oak, strawberries, confectioners sugar, magic.
Taste: whoa! I get a fresh, bright note up front that I can best describe as minty, with cranberry (totally devoid of tartness/bitterness) and strawberry quickly following behind. The fruit is about as close to eating fresh fruit as I've ever gotten in a beer—it's so clean and clear.
Feel: light but somehow a bit syrupy, and very juicy and slick. Disappears without a trace.
Overall: damn tasty beer. A notch below Vintage in my estimation, just because the latter has more complexity and richness, but this is still a spectacle of craftsmanship. 789 charactersneurobot01, Nov 02, 2015
4.5/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Bought this beer at Argonuts in Denver, CO. I really enjoy this company's stuff so I figured I would give this one a try. The price was about 20$ for 750 ml bottle.
A&S: very pungent raspberry aroma upfront, really quite overpowering. The next strongest aroma is cranberries, however I'm not getting much if any cherries. Smells pretty sour as well, but more tart than puckering. 
T&M: Cherries in the end of the taste. A little malty in the finish as well (something you don't pick up in the aroma), but similar of their other beer's finishes. Very smooth almost velvety even with a bite of carbonation. Medium-low body, medium-high carbonation.  
Overall: really fantastic beer. Probably will not buy again, but just because of the price tag. I would say it is  much better than their classic, and better than Grand Cru, but just not by enough to make me shell out 9 more dollars. Still a phenomenal beer and worth a try if only once. 939 charactersminterro, Nov 02, 2015

The red fruits are clearly in, while part of the sourness is gonne and the sweetness looks like artificial to my taste.
I would prefer more body, more sourness and less fruit, and I don't think this beer is an improvement over the GC. 347 characterscrosenkrantz, Sep 27, 2015

Smell is very fruity with mostly raspberry and cherry and a hint of oak.  Taste is a nice balance of tart, sourness and fruity sweetness, finishing with the complexity of the oak barrel aging.  Very little bitterness.  Mouth is medium-thin and lively, dry, tart and refreshing.  Overall, this is an excellent fruit sour that would go great with a lot of different foods. 723 charactersFFreak, Sep 14, 2015

Cherry, raspberry, and cranberry nose with subtle hint of oak and vanilla.
Tart raspberry and cranberry explode at first sip, followed by a sweeter vanilla, cherry, and oak palate cleanser.
Light-bodied, high carbonation, mildly tart, extremely refreshing.
Overall, while the $25 price point is hard to swallow, this brew does not disappoint. 424 characterslarryarms847, Sep 07, 2015

Was expecting more sourness from this, possibly a young bottle and needed some more time. 304 charactersDrunkAl, Aug 29, 2015
4.39/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Pours deep ruby red with fizzy white head that dissipates to about a centimeter cap.  When held away from your nose it has a very vinuous quality like a red wine.  Held to the nose there are abundant and vibrant raspberries, rock candy, a bit of the cherries, and the cranberries are the most subtle.  Slight hint of vanilla oak.  Taste has a lot of raspberry up front with a bit of vanilla and cranberry.  Finish is astringent and oaky.  Very pleasantly tart.  Light and bubbly mouthfeel with tingle and pucker on the sides of the tongue.  Excellent beer. 556 charactersBowWowWowYippyYoIPA, Aug 29, 2015

4.47/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I rarely post beer reviews, but this is a beer that needs to be discussed from the mountain tops.  
It's not often that a "shelf turd" commands this much respect, but every once in awhile a beer that most pay lip service to but not many new people to the scene have actually had, needs to be resurrected so to speak.  
We all know that European beers have been in decline for at least 20 years and have accelerated to the downside given the exponential increase in American breweries since 2011.  
However, when things become too crazy, at a minimum, we need to get back to first principles - thus the review of Rodenbach.  
It's almost redundant to even mention this beer, especially if you've listened and/or attended the SAVOR Salon with Peter Bouckaert from NB discussing his time spent at Rodenbach, but this beer, despite it's "shelf turd" status at MO BEV should be the Benchmark of what we seek in an oak aged  Belgian beer.  
We can use over priced $9 wine glass pours all day, but at the end of it, we should be left with wanting more and knowing that hundreds of years of brewing tradition led us to this wonderfully dark and tart yet slightly sweet masterpiece.  
This is that beer.  
No need to for aromas and glasses, "quaffability" scores and the like.  Just a brilliant beer from a brilliant brewery that we can all grab almost every day.  
Cheers to the much needed revitalization of a dying European craft. 1,432 charactersJsnyd05, Aug 23, 2015

4.47/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52013 bottled 6 days after the classic I just opened. Pure coincidence and really fun to try them at a similar age. Only 2nd or 3rd time for this one for me.
A- 750ml reveals a somewhat cloudy and murky rouge brew into our three glasses. Foamy and thick off white crown atop with decent retention becoming a medium ring. Several sheets of lace.
S- In the realm of both Flanders Red and Brown with a bucketload of dark fruits and sour lactic and vinegar notes. Red wine vinegar, fresh raspberries, cherry, spiced raisin, wet oak and hints of deep sugars.
T- All three of the added fruits shine here. The cranberry is noticed instantly with raspberries next and cherries following in the finish. Even at 2.5 years old the fruit notes are fresh like picked right off the plant. Tartness is medium to high being a blend of acetic and lactic acid for me. Sour lemons, medium toast woody oak, funky pie cherries, brown sugar, raisin, yeast spices, slight nuts and caramel.
MF- Creamy and substantial frothy texture with any agitation on the palate. Very high spritzy carbonation allows the flavors to truly come out and it all concludes fairly sour.
Summing this up by saying I could sip in this for hours and hours. An amazing base brew is given a whole new identity with fresh cranberry, raspberry and sour cherry all somehow shining. The base melds the fruit together brilliantly and its a match made in Belgium heaven. Closest thing to New Glarus outside of WI but with a classic Flanders feel. 1,496 characterscbutova, Aug 10, 2015

Just the right amount of vinegary taste intermixed with fruity flavors. An easy beer to drink, quaffable.  A very accessible beverage, no more challenging flavor-wise than a good dry apple cider.  (In fact I think in a blind tasting you could pass this off as a cider.) The main argument against buying this beer again is that it is so much more expensive than the garden variety Rochefort Classic (Red), yet not a substantially different drinking experience. 576 charactersalexanderplatz, Aug 08, 2015

The aromas of raspberries and cherries jump out immediately and smell quite delicious but they are joined by a melting plastic/band-aid note as the aroma continues. The taste follows suit with nice acidity and fruit character but still finishing with the off-putting plastic note.

Pours a lighter, ruby-red color, with a white, fizzy head.
Has fruity aromas of cherries and raspberries, together with a lemon peel infusion, among a tart, essig foundation and older cheese. Its funky sourness seemingly evolves foremost from the fruits, with a noteable vinegary acidity. 
Has a high carbonation with a refreshing, but thin body, hiding its 7 abv almost too well.
Tastes of a moldy malt foundation and a mix of acetic acid and vinous tartness, together with a gentle fruitiness of unripe cherries and riper raspberries. Its tartness has a dough mouthfeel to it, wrapped up by fresh fermented wine, still seemingly evoked by the fruits, as for the beer's sour aspect. Turns a bit maltier during the finish, with a rich fruitiness staying on the palate, while producing a gentle sweetness.
Offers a truly harmonious blend of red fruits and vinegar, young wine and a pleasant, fitting sweetness. Both, tartness and sweetness seem to evolve from the fruits, giving the beer a very natural and tasty characteristic. Its vinuous aspect doesnt define the beers overall taste, it is on par with the fruits and creates a pleasant complexity, which leaves the palate soon though. 1,219 charactersaleigator, Jun 20, 2015

A: Cherry, raspberry, cranberry, lots of berry aromas, smell berry good. Picking up some oak, sweet, smells sweeter than it does tart, smells great.
T: Cherries, tartness, cranberries, raspberries, some oak, finishes dry, alcohol is not even noticeable, this beer has lots of flavor.
M: Medium mouthfeel, dry finish, lots of carbonation.
O: World-class, lots of berries flavors, slight oak, great balance with the carbonation, very tasty. I hope I can pick up another. 594 charactersBrolo75, Jun 16, 2015

Pours clear ruby red/copper color with a 2 finger fairly dense off white head with solid retention, that reduces to a ring of lacing. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart cherry, cranberry, raspberry, strawberry, green apple, lemon, red grape, light cider vinegar, caramel, toast, hay, straw, grass, oak, light pepper, light musty funk, and yeast/oak earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, berries, dark malt, and oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart cherry, cranberry, raspberry, strawberry, green apple, lemon, red grape, light cider vinegar, caramel, toast, hay, straw, grass, oak, light pepper, light musty funk, and yeast/oak earthiness. Fair amount of fruit tartness and light yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of cherry, cranberry, raspberry, strawberry, apple, red grape, caramel, toast, oak, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, berries, dark malt, and oak barrel flavors; with an awesome sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/acidic mouthfeel that is amazing. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is a world class fruited Flanders red ale. All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, berries, dark malt, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth to drink with the low amount of acidity. An insanely amazing offering. 1,737 characterssuperspak, Jun 14, 2015

A: Pours a slightly hazy dark mahogany color with a couple of fingers of light brown head. A few wispy streaks of soapy lace were left down the glass along with a lasting collar. 
S: Subtly complex notes of sweet fruit puree mixed with musty oak and a clean, bright, tartness. The nose is sweet, and each of the fruits in noticeable, with raspberry and cranberry sticking out the most to me. 
T: Follows the nose with sweet and fruity red berry flavors. Sour cherries and oak are lightly tannic, but there is a ton of balancing sugary sweetness. Raspberries puree is sweet up front, with hints of tart cranberries and earthy, slightly spicy yeast and oak barrel. The finish is nice and tart, with a lingering sugary sweetness in the aftertaste. Yeast flavors are complex and add depth that other sweet fruit beers do not have.
M: Full body, sweet and heavy but not cloying, with a slick, chewy mouthfeel and frothy yet soft carbonation. 
O: Another great beer from the masters of the style. Complex super sweet and fruity flavors mixed with subtle oak and spices. 1,092 charactersscottfrie, May 10, 2015

4.39/5  rDev -1.1%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Poured from the 750ml bottle into a wine glass, caractere rouge is in character with a reddish brown pour. An actively fizzy head reduces to a fine ring of lacing on the glass.
The nose speaks of fruit, leather and oak.There is a strong cranberry presence layered with raspberry and strawberry. There is an underlying oaky, leathery smell. There is some medicinal quality to the elixir and a measure of funkiness.
The flavor is much more rounded and softer than the nose suggested. It's really delicious. There is only a mild amount of tartness - really a perfect amount for it to be refreshing. There is a ton of juicy fruit in the flavor - slightly sweet and mostly cranberry and raspberry but also cherry and even strawberry. It's a little medicinal on the mid-palate but dries out and does not overpower. There is also a soft oakiness that helps carry the large amount of fruit and make it interesting. There is definitely influence from the flanders red that makes Grand Cru such a nice beer but the effect here is a little lighter, more subtle and more distinct. I think you would have to like cranberries to really like this beer.
The mouthfeel is driven by active, creamy carbonation. Very nice.
I didn't expect this beer to be so easy to drink. But it is. It's very well done. If not for the nitpick of a slight medicinal smell and flavor - as well as the high cost - this would be a homerun. 1,405 charactersbrianmandell, May 06, 2015

4.26/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Bottle:
Pours rose side of burgundy.  Decent white head grows on pour, fades to the edges but lasts.  Beer seems translucent to clear, but deep color essentially block most light.  Nose is almost spoiled wine-like: some fruit notes, but with a vinegar note to it.  I get the raspberry, maybe a hint of cranberry, but none of it is very strong (though it does seem more evident a little later in the drink).
Taste has the fruitiness from the nose, but more evident: raspberry and cranberry.  The cherry might provide some tartness, which is there and blends nicely with other fruit flavors.  I also do get a bit of cider vinegar taste behind the tartness.  The carbonation tickles the tongue nicely, and the beer is quite smooth or even silly in its own way.
Another hit by Rodenbach.  I think having one of their beers every so often should be a plan of mine.  The lightness of the sour or the vinegar tartness that is a part of their beers just isn't my ideal, so I can't go world class level myself, although I appreciate the balance of flavors. 1,049 characterscjgiant, May 03, 2015

Pours ruby red with a thin head.  The smell is a sour fruit concoction with oak pouring through.  The taste is just a tad sour and tart but you really can taste the raspberry and cranberry with an oak finish.  Excellent beer and one that is a great example of a craft beer that is put together extremely well. 335 characterssjones5045, Apr 26, 2015

4.28/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25A gorgeous coloured pour; hazy dark red (almost a mahogany) with two fingers of pinkish-brown soapy head that becomes a light film after a short time.  Average lacing.
Raspberry dominates the nose, big supporting cherry, a touch of cranberry.  Amazingly fruity.  Something like an over-sweetened jam to the nose, definite sugar presence.  Balsamic backing throughout.  I get a big hit of toasted wood (think: light char from saw) every so often.  Sadly I do get an unwelcome medicinal note that detracts from the experience.
A bit of a change from the nose, cranberry clearly dominates, cherry close behind.  Big and tart upfront.  Raspberry pops in halfway through carrying some sour funkiness with it.  Fruit-sweet, as opposed to sugar-sweet.  No proper barrel presence (apart from funkiness), and no noticeable medicinal qualities like the nose had.  Balsamic still backs everything up.  Tart through-and-through and ridiculously juicy.
Light bodied.  Smooth with a very dry finish.  Highly carbonated.
A vastly different beer to the base.  The bold and clear fruits are a joy, and it is oh so drinkable! 1,111 charactersGasc0igne, Apr 22, 2015

L - Pours a deep cherry red with a one finger pinkish head that fades quickly.
S - The nose seems really jammy to me with a slightly medicinal quality. The cranberries, raspberries and cherries really mesh well together. Definitely some oak mixed in.
T - So much tart cranberries, cherries and raspberries! The sour is mild at first then builds to where you can taste in the back of your jaws. Lacto and oak all throughout. I can definitely see some jam quality.
F - Medium body and medium carbonation. Smooth body, creamy.
O - This is a special beer to be enjoyed slowly. I think having this on the regular would ruin me. 648 characterscvm4, Apr 10, 2015

A- Pours a hazy reddish light brown color with a 1/4 inch light tan head that retains a bit before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and a small center patch of sheer surface foam.  Not-so-resilient lacing leaves small clots behind.
S- Has that classic funky kriek aroma of bright sweet cherry with a moderate medicinal quality.  Also lots of dark fruit like plum, fig and black raspberry.  There's also a slight Brett presence lending a note of green olive.
T- Lots of sweet golden raisin upfront, then the cranberry, sour cherries and lactic acid come in to tarten (did I just invent a word?) things up.  The raisin lasts through to the aftertaste resulting in a port-like quality.  
M- Moderately tart and sticky with medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side.
O- I would definitely liken this more to a Kriek than a Flanders Red but, either way, it's very tasty.  Definitely on the sweeter side and could use a tad more tartness but the complexity is there. 1,067 charactersImmortale25, Mar 28, 2015

The beer pours a burgundy color, hazy and cloudy with light garnet and ruby hues with a thick finger of off-white head sitting atop the beer, good retention yielding a few spots of lace. The aroma is nice, tart cranberry, stone fruits, funk, oak, hearty grain and some really sharp sweetness here, like candi sugar overload. The flavors are nice, plenty of fruit, raspberry jam, tart cherry and cranberry, certainly sweet, but as aggressive as in the aroma, stone fruits, funk, chewy oak and dark grains, decently balanced though again, still quite sweet for me. The mouthfeel is very nice, lively but gentle carbonation, very smooth and soft, coats the mouth exceptionally well, light pucker at the finish that is mildly dry, spot on for the style. 
Verdict: A nice Flanders Red Ale from Rodenbach, perhaps a bit too sweet for my palette, but the fruit flavors are very enjoyable, delicate and balanced. Another example of why Rodenbach is easily the best producer of Flander's beers in the world. 1,103 characterskevanb, Mar 20, 2015

S:  Moderate tart cherry, with light notes of cranberry and raspberry.
T:  Medium sour cherry more pronounced on the tongue, complemented with the moderate flavor of other berries. Slightly more sour than tart with just a hint of sweetness.
M:  Moderate carbonation and thickness, the sensations of which amount to a significant component of this ale.
O:  Dark, brooding and sexy. Tartness of the cranberry and raspberry lend a vivid bite to the primary note of wild cherry, making this a drink to savor slowly. Enjoying it as such maintains an extremely pleasant aroma of red consistently in the mouth. 700 characterssamshaw, Feb 27, 2015

Reddish clear, with heavy berry notes on the nose and a light funk.
The beer itself is much sweeter than anticipated, with the only tartness being a sort of dried cranberry -- it's fruity-sour and not acidic-sour. Rich and full, the mouthfeel is great. 
I don't think I like this as much as standard Grand Cru, but it's tasty! 378 charactersAgentMunky, Feb 12, 2015
4.67/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This is an amazing beer. As with all of the Caractère Rouge bottled beer, it is 75-cl corked and caged.
When it is held to the light is a bright ruby red thanks to all of the cranberries, raspberries and cherries.
On the nose you get all of the fruits right at the beginning, followed by a bit of vinegar and general sourness, but overall, it is soft and it all comes together very well. 
When you take your first sip, you get all of the fruit right away and that is washed over by the sourness and tartness. It is a perfect blend of fruit and sour and tart and it is all held together with the oak. Nothing is over powered. It is perfectly balanced for my taste.
While this beer comes with a significant tag, it is a great beer to have for that special occasion. 768 charactersjpmccann, Feb 11, 2015

Amazing fruit aroma, with raspberries leading the way and cherries not far behind. Taste is an absolute delight. Fruity, but still with the complexity of a good Flanders red. Maybe a bit more earthiness and funk would be beneficial, but this is a fantastic beer. 374 characterswarnerry, Feb 11, 2015

Pours a deep, murky reddish-brown color with one finger of light tan head and moderate carbonation evident. Smells and tastes of vanilla, tannic, loads of cherries, cranberries, tart raspberries, oak, strawberries, and mixed berries. Light vinegar but way more on the fruity sour side, which works great. Medium body and moderate carbonation.
Overall i thought this was awesome. It was quite expensive but if you love fruity sours definitely try this out at least once. If I saw it again I'd pick up the occasional bottle. 693 charactersmdfb79, Feb 05, 2015

Complex nose of tart and sour with notes of vinegar, hints of raspberry and cherry over a subtle fruit like sweetness.  As it warms, oak notes are present.
Light medium body with a smooth texture that approaches creamy and has an oily characteristic as well.  Above normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the finish.  In short, World Class.
The flavor profile is World Class and serves as the standard against which others should be judged.  It is intense, quite complex and a brewer's masterpiece of balance.  It begins with a burst of tart fruit, raspberries and cherries, over a slightly sweet background.  In the middle, tartness gives a slight pucker with only the slightest hint of sour vinegar.  The raspberry and cherry fruit flavors slowly subside and cranberry comes to the forefront over a caramel like sweetness.  As the finish approaches, dryness comes to the forefront coupled still with a nice tart pucker and flavor.  In the finish, oak notes come to the forefront coupled with a slow fade of tartness and slight sourness.  A dry pucker lingers. 1,246 characterstillmac62, Jan 20, 2015

4.45/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5750 ml caged and corked bottle, no date on the bottle that I could find so I have no idea how old or what batch number this is.  I'm pretty sure I've had this bottle for about a year if not longer, so it does have some age on it.  Served in a Prairie Teku, the beer pours a slightly hazy ruby red/brown color with about a half inch light tan head.  The head fizzled away quickly, and there isn't much lacing.  Aroma is nice and fruity (sweet and tart), the brew smells like raspberries, cherries, oak, vinegar, lemon and a bit of cranberry.  The taste overall is a bit sweeter than I expected it to be.  It tastes like raspberries, cherries (both sweet and tart ones), cranberries, oak, grape skins, caramel, vinegar and a bit of apple and lemon peel.  The tart flavors were subtle at first, but then got stronger as I finished the bottle.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy with a good amount of soft carbonation.  I think this is a pretty good overall brew.  Definitely worth buying if you see it anywhere!  $21.99 a bottle. 1,036 charactersbluejacket74, Jan 18, 2015

A  sits reddish brown in the glass with a ruby glow when held to the light,  not much for head or lace but not far off the style 
S   its like smelling juice, cranberry, strawberry, raspberries, black current, cherries, a little apple, massive fruity notes, some brown sugar, a hint of vinegar, and faint wet wood, just brilliant I'd change nothing 
T   fruits more sour then sweet unlike the nose, more vinegar, still some brown sugar, not as intense as the nose but still very tasty
M  tart, a little sweet and sour going on, medium bodied, more bubbles then I could see in the glass, slippery with liquids in your mouth, long earthy, fruity finish 
O  I'm almost done the bottle at this point so that says something, smells perfect and solid everywhere else  
I can see why this beer has such a great reputation, I might just sit here smelling the empty bottle all night 979 characterswordemupg, Jan 03, 2015

S-smells very acidic, vinegar, apples and a little lemon
T-delicious raspberry hits your tongue first followed by a slightly tart cherry and a little melon in the finish 
M-very smooth for being a sour but not quite as smooth as traditional rodenbach or the grand cru. Medium carbonation makes this incredibly drinkable but this is just a hair on the tart side.
O-this is pretty phenomenal overall. If it wasn't for the price I would keep this stocked always. Highly recommend. 552 charactersbeerhan, Jan 01, 2015

4.42/5  rDev -0.5%BOTTLE: 750 ml. Brown glass. Appealing label design. Branded cap in a cage, set over a cork.
Expectations are sky high; I have massive respect for and love Rodenbach (even under Palm).
Served chilled into a Westvleteren goblet and allowed to come to room temperature over the course of consumption. 7.0% ABV. 
Cork pops hard and hits the ceiling upon removal (with pliers), but no beer surges out. It's well packaged for aging.
A fizzy cascading bubble show emerges as it's poured, and remains for some time - quite the spectacle when combined with the beer's vibrance.
HEAD: 3 fingers wide. Best described as a pinkish white; it's alluring and almost unique. Foamy but not too fizzy, with a soft cobwebby consistency and a decent spongey complexion. Its lightness is apt for the style, and its effervescence is teasing - between beer and champagne. It retains quite well (for ~10 minutes), but leaves no lacing on the sides of the glass as it recedes.
BODY: A bright plump vibrant red. Not a solid red, but a weak one; grapeskin comes to mind. Light, translucent, and transparent. Clean, with no visible yeast particulate or hop sediment.
It's a lively inviting appearance, and has me curious.
AROMA: Powdered white sugar, fresh cherries, fresh rapberries, and touches of tart cranberries. Incredibly evocative; the fruitiness is just perfect. Soft and lush, with no off-notes, though some American drinkers may note a cherry-like medicinal note. I'm just blown away by how fresh and vivid this aroma is. Sourness is mild - maybe a 5 or 6 out of 10 in terms of intensity, but what really works are the cherry pie notes Rodenbach is known for. The pie crust married to the blunt oak tone is lovely, but I do find myself missing the damp acetic oak barrel character I love in regular Rodenbach. In any case, this easily approachable light powdery aroma has my mouth watering. Wow.
It boasts tricky subtlety in terms of its yeast & bacteria; I'd guess pedio and a bit of lactobacillus.
Aromatic intensity is average.
TASTE: The taste is every bit as fresh and evocative as the aroma, evoking notes of soft luscious raspberry, tart cherry, and sweetened cranberry. Powdered sugar comes to mind in taste as in texture. Rodenbach's signature cherry pie/pie crust notes emerge in the second act, lending even more depth to an already fascinatingly subtle and intricate brew. The oak is attuned to the flavour profile without being overbearing; it's present only as a guiding tone which ensures the flavour profile's cohesion - as if it wasn't a gestalt brew already.
Undeniably more than the sum of its parts, this flavour profile blows me away. Good duration of flavour and apt flavour intensity.
The pucker-lovers may crave still more sourness - this offers only a 5 out of 10 - but I have trouble imagining this impossibly careful balance disturbed. It's just immaculate. I do want more of the acetic character I go to Rodenbach for; they do it better than anyone. 
In short, it's fucking incredible. A treat of a brew.
To nitpick, I do think it could use more tartness and cranberry, and I greedily want still more cherry pie and acetic character.
TEXTURE: Has a delicacy and fragility I've observed in extremely few beers, with an effortless lightness on the palate that really makes the flavours sing, and gives a quenching refreshing feel that's heaven with the tart berry notes. Soft and light-bodied without being weak or watery; I don't know how they do it. Naturally, it's soft and wet, and does have an above average acidity as well as a light puckery twang. Smacky and powdery in perfect fashion, with the perfect amount of creaminess as well. Carbonation is perfect.
It's almost flawless. Just a bit more body would help give the flavours a bit more support, and a bit more acidity and/or smackiness wouldn't hurt. But it's damn near perfect.
OVERALL: Effortlessly drinkable, an effect reached by an ideal harmony of texture and taste: the angelic lightness of the mouthfeel keeps the palate craving more and the incredible fresh berry notes are divine. An accomplishment in the style, and a beer whose quality forces me to savor each sip. Absolutely a paragon. Incredible work. I tip my hat to Rodenbach yet again. I imagine I will definitely be picking up more bottles of this, but it's hard to imagine it could improve with age - it's already so good. This is in the upper echelon of beers currently being brewed, and demands the discerning drinker's attention. A very welcome addition to my top beers of all time. Take note - this is how subtlety and balance are done.
High A
Pair with fresh raspberries.
Serve chilled, not cold. 4,662 characterskojevergas, Dec 15, 2014

A: slightly translucent but muddy red. Nice foamy head for a sour. Really pleasant looking.
S: amazing. One of the best smells from a sour. Rich cranberries with a cherry soda component. Like candy.
T: clean. Not ultra sour but pleasant. A buttery sourness lighter in vinegar character than say rodenbach grand cru. Everything here works really well and the light carbonation brings it together.
M: great acid feel very smooth. Lingering sourness not overbearing. Real clean all around.
O: a great find. $25 well spent. Enjoyed much more than the vintage of many different years. Love sours and a great change up on the kriek with cranberries. Bomb. 719 charactersputonyourwalkingshoes, Nov 20, 2014

4.42/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5My third time having this. Shared with "The Crew" for Scott's birthday.
Nice deep red color with a small pinkish white head. 
Great fruit flavors all around. Cranberries especially coming through really nicely and maybe are the most prevalent, followed by raspberry and sour cherries. Craisins come to mind. It has slight tartness but far from the sourness and vinegar expected in a flanders red, intense fruit flavors definitely takeover here. Slightly funky Belgian yeast, bready dessert malts, caramel and oak make for a nice base. The body is light, highly carbonated, gets more tart as it warms, and finishes nice and dry. Drinks very easy.
This is basically New Glarus-quality fruit beer with an easygoing Belgian Flanders base, which is very nice. The fruit is allowed to shine through excellently, especially enjoyed the cranberry aspect. Easy-going, complex and excellent. 884 charactersChico1985, Oct 27, 2014

4.39/5  rDev -1.1%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle into a tulip.
Appearance: Pours a cloudy reddish-brown color. The head is two fingers high, and slightly pink in shade. The texture is horrible - it looks like soda, and retention is average at best. Almost no lacing is left on the glass. (3)
Smell: Holy fruits. There are an incredible amount of cherries and raspberries, and I'm incredibly impressed with how natural they smell. This is the fruitiest beer I've ever encountered, in fact. Only complaint is that the sourness I like in Rodenbach Grand Cru is a bit concealed. Otherwise... (4.5)
Taste: It's Rodenbach Grand Cru with a far more vibrant fruit flavor - mainly. The sourness comes through in the back end, but remains beautifully subtle. Its aftertaste reveals a bit of cranberry, too. Letting it warm up reveals a gentle woodiness. It's not too sweet, and it's not too tart (though as Oude Tart revealed earlier, that's not exactly a bad thing), it's just right. Not to mention, it's complexity is just right, too. (4.5) 
Mouthfeel: Despite having a rich initial sweetness, it somehow manages to be rather dry. It feels like a great wine with the powerful tannins and carbonation cleansing the palate. Because of the flavor intensity, it's not super drinkable - but who cares? This is a fantastic sipper. (4.25)
Overall: Honestly, it's closer to a fruit beer than a sour. So? That just makes it the best fruit beer I've ever had. This not only brings a fruity richness others in the style lack, but its sourness cleanses the sweetness beautifully. Shame it's so expensive...no, wait, I don't care, I'd definitely buy a bottle of this again. (4.5)

Pours a ruby red color with a 1/2 inch head that dissipates rather quickly. No lacing present at as I imbibe.
Smells of tart raspberry, sweet cherries, and sugary goodness.
Tastes of amazing raspberry notes with subtle cherries and a tartness that is not too overwhelming. 
Overall an awesome beer that I was lucky to
Come across thanks to Eddy the bartender. Would definitely seek this out again! 562 charactersBudinetz, Sep 17, 2014

4.48/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Beautiful reddish/pink/brown ale, with a light, pink creme head. Retention is poor (expected for the style). Brew is pulpy and translucent.
Absolutely delectable aroma, featuring Rodenbach's yeasty funk; significant oak, tartness, and vanilla; and a ton of tart fruits. Raspberries and cranberries stand out, with a hint of tart cherry behind. A floral bouquet appears as it warms. The sourness of this beer is neither hidden nor overpowering.
Flavor is much more fruit-forward than the aroma implies, but otherwise hits on everything you might expect. Funk and oak up front; immediately followed by fruit and tannins; and washed over on the back-end by a tumultuous mixture of cherries, raspberries, cranberries, vanilla, and apples.  Very sweet, and less subtle than other Rodenbach beers, but no less complex. Quite sour, but with plenty of balancing sweetness from the fruit. Divine.
Tart and puckering, with a sticky, lively mouthfeel. Long finish; you'll be smacking your lips and gums long after the brew has been swallowed.
Another fantastic, fantastic Flanders by Rodenbach, and finally a fruit-forward version. This easily can step up and compete with the best fruit lambics of the rest of Belgium, and of New Glarus. 1,231 charactersRoguer, Sep 14, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -4.3%Pours a light red color with a short lived white head that recedes to a lace.  Active carbonation rises up the edges of the glass.  
The aroma is complexly fruity with big berry notes sticking out.  Just a bit of wheat and wine elements come out in the aroma which is exceptional.
In the taste, tart fruits, dry cranberry, slight sourness, raspberry and cherry come through more in the finish with plenty of fruit and sour to go around.  Finishes dry, with a slight bitter edge to the fruit.
Full bodied, yet quite dry and well carbonated ale.  Overall, an exceptional fruited Belgian sour.  Worthy of much praise and discussion.  For special occasions. 660 charactersStinkypuss, Sep 06, 2014

4.67/5  rDev +5.2%Bottle from the Dogz place near Pittsburgh. Pricey. Pours dark red with some brownish hues and a bit of light showing through, along with a nice two finger off white head with some pink tones to it. Awesome aroma of cherries and raspberries, lots if sweet fruit here, light tartness, a bit of oak. Flavor is plenty of sourness but not overbearing acidity on the tongue, some oak here but dominated by fruit, sweet raspberries, lots of cherries, and I assume the cranberries add a bit of the tart tones here. Medium bodied with nearly spritzy carbonation that mingles perfectly with the sourness to balance out all the sweet berries here. World class brew. 656 charactersBMMillsy, Aug 22, 2014

If I had to choose one beer to drink the rest of my life, this would be it (as of now). That is why this is the only beer I give a perfect 5. 440 charactersWobbly, Aug 22, 2014

smells sweet like young gueze or lambic.
a very hidden tart on the nose as well.

head is just a thin layer.
very nicely carbonated.
taste is overly sweet berry flavor with some light tartness.
mouthfeel is sweet but leads to light funk and tart dryness. 
probably would not purchase again at the price (23.99) but not a bad beer to have for dessert. seems very "one-notey" front to back and way to sweet for my liking. would age help? 520 characterscoriswrasse, Aug 01, 2014

A- Nice reddish brown
S- White oak, dark fruits. Salivation begins immediatately
T- Very sour, but the oak, cranberry and tart cherrys come through. Very well balanced for such a complex beer.
M- I little sour burning
O - This one is very sour, but the bright, clean oak and fruit distract. Great sour! 366 charactersPBRmeasap1980, Jun 15, 2014

Bottle to Rodenbach cervoise
750ml c/c
Purchased from Toronado SD on 5/16 for my Bday.
App- The color of this beer was a deep garnet mixed with more of a burgundy color. I didn't see this one as being overtly deep. Nice color mix with some lighter mixed colors. A bit dense in the center. More head than I would've thought. A solid 1-1/2 inch head. A small amount of cling.
Smell- So when I first poured this it smelled like someone had boiled down some fresh fruit and it was cooling on the stove. More of the raspberries dominated with some of the cherry. I truly was on fruit overload vs. getting the oak or the booze on this one.
Taste- For a flanders to be this smooth I was surprised. The oak was very subtle in the back and made way for all the fruits to be a well done compliment to the aging of this beer. The again component of the raspberries dominated IMO. I liked how easy drinking this way. A style subset that is equated to a sour. Wasn't very sorry and allowed to be savored.
Mouth- A good and creamy medium body with the matching carbonation to it. Was very fruit dominant in the residual flavor, however more of the oak and sour came out when it warmed and lingered on the palate for a bit.
Drink- So I had just finished a PNC for my bday and colored me pink when I saw this in the case. Thank god for a caring and understanding GF. Who said its on me. Happy Birthday. Was well worth the review. Great fruits, small oak and just a very good beer. 1,490 charactersFosterJM, May 19, 2014

Location: Port Chester Beer Distributor
Glassware: Red Wine Glass
Appearance: Rosy in color pouring with a pinkish carbonation. While the head doesn't last a small ring of carbonation does remain. 
Aroma: As advertised cranberries and sour cherries come through on the nose. With nice notes of raspberry as well. The oak vat has a presence in a lovely wood smell with hints of oak. 
Taste: The fruit has the major profile for this beer giving it a very tart flavor. The tartness is assisted by the wild yeast. Tart is very much the word as I pucker slightly with every sip. 
Mouthfeel: Light to Medium in body. Light to medium in carbonation. The beer itself is very dry and leaves your mouth watering. 716 charactersKornWallace, May 08, 2014

My favorite of the Rodenbach family. It is the most tart of all and resembles more a sour beer than a red Flanders.
Pouring reveals a dark red color. Unable to see through. There is little carbonation, but bubbles are very tiny and pleasant. A tiny head forms but dissipates quickly. Aroma reveals all sorts of berries, and lambics. Taste is great. It is tart, fruity, a bit sweet, and closes with a dryness in your mouth. 
Mouth feel is light. This is a light bodied beer. Great beer. 494 charactersJulioH, May 06, 2014
4.69/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Damn near perfect, and I think an improvement over the other Rodenbachs (which I love). This one has the same sharp bite, slightly softened and made more complex by pronounced, but elegant wood, and a winter spice note, probably from the oak and the older beer that plays up a slight sweet note that contrasts beautifully with the red fruit in the sourness and the vinous notes. I absolutely loved this version of a classic. Great! 431 charactersGeorgiabeer, May 06, 2014

Sour cherries in the nose with very deep dark sour cherries on the palate.
Dry but not overbearingly so with a very crisp acidic character. 
Hints of dirty blankets but not overbearing. 
Wonderfully complex and a real pleaser in every way. If i had any criticism at all it'd be that i wanted a tad more of a tart cranberry character. /93 456 charactersschwemjw, Apr 30, 2014

Appearance: Pours a delightful black cherry/raspberry dark red/maroon color and leaves a finger of off-white head which fades slowly to a layer atop the beer.
Smell: Big juicy raspberry jam upfront, cranberries, black sour cherries all blended together wonderfully. Not overly sweet, but I detect more sweet scents than sour. Big sweet and sour mixed berries. Hints of vinegar.
Taste: Big raspberries up front followed by black cherries and a hint of cranberries. A twist of lime in there (like a raspberry lime rickey!) Nice tart finish, just a tad dry, but overall this is quite juicy/jammy. Some woodiness to it towards that latter half of the flavor - definitely has some red wine flavors.. The taste is a bit more tart than sweet, but still really well balanced between the two. Really lovely.
Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation with a medium body. Very interesting combination of juicy and dry in the mouth. The finish is a tad dry as well. Nice mouth-feel.
Overall: This is a really nice beer. Extremely well balanced with big sweet and tart berry flavors that balance each other out. Really a delight to sip on, this is very drinkable as well. 1,264 charactersResuin, Apr 10, 2014

Pours clear ruby red, tiny foamy head at first, rapidly faded to a thin not very sticky lacing.
You can smell the sour cherries right after popping the cork, along with balsamic vinegar. Very very strong. Lots of forest berries also, some lime zest, green barnyard funk. Very intense and perfumey.
Wow, ok.. Taking the first sip you get a short extremely sour flash, just for a second, quickly balanced by a nice fruity sweetness afterwards. Really complex. At first lime zest, sour cherries and sour acidic forest berries, like cranberry and aronia berry, followed by sweeter raspberry and wild strawberry. Not a lot of vinegar tartness, red fruit overwhelm it all. A nice funky feel from the live yeasts and the oak barrels, bringing the green hay, floorboard, barnyard funk, some hints of vanilla and some floral-herbal notes, like ribwort and wild thyme. Hard to say if hops are strongly present, but there's a little extra dryness (aside from the sourness' aftermath and the dry white wine feel) and bitter note that point to some nice green leafiness.
Very clean mouthfeel, rather fizzy/prickly, but it works. Dry in the finish, but the aftertaste is as complex as this whole beer. I read on the label that it has corn, and expected a bit of syrupy malts, but it was all perfectly hidden under the fruitiness.
The mother of all Flemish beers, incredible chemistry, a must try for any beer lover. Best sour i've ever had! 1,444 charactersdcmchew, Apr 03, 2014

A: Hazy, reddish-brown body with 1/2 finger of off-white head. Ok retention. Minimal lacing.
S: Lactic/citric acid tartness. Cherry features most predominantly, with lesser berry, grape. Lemon. Traces of mint, herb. Wood. The overall character is both familiar and unique.
T: Moderate sweet & sour with a stone fruit tang. Hint of chocolate. Minimal bitterness and a semi-dry finish. Lingering tartness in the aftertaste. Degrees of herbal earthiness, oak. Minimal alcohol.
M: Moderately robust carbonation with a certain zing. Moderate body. Nicely effervescent and palate-coating.
O: Excellent Flanders red with some interesting woody, herbal notes. Drinks very well. Very balanced. Surprisingly, I didn't find it any more fruity than Rodenbach's typical offering. Great brew.

Smell is lightly sweet malt, a little woody, spritzy acidity tinges the nose. Brightness. 
Taste is amazing. Soft acidity, cherries and lime, a little sweet-tarts, cider vinegar. More depth then the nose, complex, yet integrated, and outright delicious. 
Mouthfeel is acidic, dry, light bodied. 
Drinkability is excellent. Extremely delicious, and impressively elegant. Lots of flavor, but neither the sour, the sugar, or the fruit are exaggerated or out of balance. Outstanding beer, one of the best. 622 charactersccrida, Mar 04, 2014

The taste is woody, with a cherry aftertaste. Somewhere along the way sugared oranges show up, but it's not sweet, if that makes any sense at all. It's not sour at all, but just delightfully dry. It has some vanilla in the mix and just is really interesting. Every time I try to get a hand on it, something else wells up. Mouthfeel is terrific, slick and slightly tingly. Overall, this is one hell of a beer! I'm not sure what to make of it, but it doesn't care, it has far too much going on to care about my opinion. 737 charactersroblowther, Feb 27, 2014

Huge pop!
A: Nice plum red, with some slight showing of sediment. A finger of slightly rosy head. Slightly dull yellow in the dimple, which shows of a steady stream of tiny bubbles. Lacing forms, but does not hold. Barely any sheeting.
S: Fruits coming through very well on the nose. Cranberry is more subdued, but definitely there, and blends well with the raspberry. Sour cherry stands out slightly from the others. Nice acidity, as is to be expected.
T/MF: Oh, yeah! Just a touch of sweetness. Some cranberry dryness. Raspberry seed, raspberry. Morello cherry. Plenty of acidity, but it shows more as crispness than tartness. It also seems to affect a slight chill on the tongue. Nicely balanced carbonation; not too heavy, but not at all flat.
Very nice. Sort of a cross breed between a Flanders Red and a Lambic. Just a great beer! 963 charactersTruePerception, Feb 20, 2014

S: From a distance, all you smell is some spicy oak. But as you get closer, huge amounts of ripe and jammy fruit notes pull you in. Overripe raspberry and tart cranberry notes lead the way, with just a touch of vinegar and some sweet syrup soaked cherry notes in the background. Vanilla and just a touch of spicy oak in the background. Amazing.
T: Opens on a sweet cranberry note with just a tug of tartness, slowly fading into pure raspberry jam. Ripe blueberry, cherry skin tannins and some silky smooth malt notes in the back. Finish is a touch dry with some oak and lingering dried cranberry and black cherry skin notes. There's a lot of sweetness here, but it's held in check perfectly by some on point carbonation and the nice drying finish. Could easily be the best Flanders red I've had. 931 charactersnotchucknorris, Feb 13, 2014

Review #434.
App- Dark pink-red body, light pink head, good retention, nice lacing
Smell- Sweet raspberries, tart cherry, oak, a nice bit of rubbery funk, a lot of vinegar mixed in with a bit of brown malt sweetness. Very interesting nose indeed.
Flavour- Delicious. Oak tannins, tart cherries, rubbery funk, vinegar making this a 5/10 sour, some sweet brown malts, and faint raspberry fruitiness. Not overly sweet, but quite dry and tart. Complex and interesting.
Mouthfeel- Medium bodied, well carbonated, good body and easily drinkable despite the acidity. I am sure my teeth are still there after this one.
Overall- Very interesting and delicious Belgian sour. After finishing the bottle, I saw that this is a Flanders Red on BA and that really threw me off. This tastes more like a fruit lambic in a lot of ways, although the brown malts do come across more than say, Rosé de Gambrinus. My wife and I certainly enjoyed trying this one! Thank you Eduardo, for the lovely wedding gift. 1,236 charactersStevedore, Feb 08, 2014

Tart red cranberries, refined oakiness, sour raspberries and stems, cheesy funk, pie cherries, currant, lemon pith, and white vinegar. Sour, even for a Rodenbach.
Cranberry, first, with tart cherry and old Flemish ale malt coming next. Nice and tart. Oak and hints of vanilla trickle in, but without the weight of typical malty Rodenbach construction. Raspberry and lemon peel. Awesome fruitiness. Acetic qualities are sharp, but not overly vinegary.
Smooth feel. A little light in the body. Tartness isn't unsettling. Spritzy carbonation blends in the mouth.
Big-time want, knocked down right now. Slam! Awesome brew. Have another in the fridge. Thanks for the bottle share, Bryan! 829 charactersthecheapies, Jan 27, 2014

4.24/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5We rip the cage and cork, pouring a brew of shimmering ruby reds into our Ommegang Game of Thrones snifters. It puts up a hearty three finger head of cotton candy colored foam that lies in a single tight unit, save for a soapy bubble mountain to one side of it. This retains decently, leaving wet drops of lacing that drip back into the main body within seconds. No haze or sediment is noted, and carbonation appears to be lightly active throughout. The nose is insanely tart, giving notes of simple syrup soaked cranberries, raspberries, and blueberries, with dried black cherry skins, heavy caramel and bourbon sweetness, dried oaky moldiness, dried papaya and mango flesh, spice of cinnamon and green cardamom pods, vinegar and soured lemon acidity, dried floral petals, red and dusty pale maltiness, chokecherries, and biting vinyl plastics. Our first impression is that this beer is impressively sour and puckering, and surprisingly, that the most forward fruity flavor is that of the cranberry. The flavoring takes off with juicy, fruity bubblegum sweetness, intense fermented cranberry and raspberry sourness, biting rubbers and phenolic plastics, tart oaky punch, red wine vinegar, dried and chipped red grape skins, mustard seed, and cotton candy fluffiness. The middle comes to a peak with blunted mallow sugars, rotten strawberry and raspberry fruit mash, soured cherry flesh, coppery and irony metallics, powdered cinnamon, thin plastic sheets, pencil lead, dried apricot, potpourri petals, and acidic sourness of that fermented fruit maceration. The end washes through with soured acidity of stomach juices, synthetic red grape flavoring, frozen raspberry puree, cranberry flesh and water, tonic water bitters, succulent pomegranate seeds, artificial plastic bite, thick waves of oaky heaviness, moss and green grassiness, confectioner’s sugar battered fresh cherries, and pale wheatiness. The aftertaste breathes with dampening maltiness of caramel, pale, and ruddy amber maltiness, hollow wheatiness, sunflower pollen, salted toffee, foamy plastics, dried cranberry and raspberry bite and crumble, moldy blue cheese funk, balsamic vinegar, burnt wheat breadiness, white pepper and garlic salts, continued cherry flesh sours, overripe strawberries, and dry burgundy red. The body is light but sticky and sweet on the lips, while carbonation is medium. Each sip affords wet cream and froth, which thins them a bit, but slurp, smack, pop, and glug are all intact and powerfully appropriate. The mouth is briefly coated with residual stickiness of sugars, with a quickly following puck and twinge of dryness. The muscles of the palate and cheeks contract and swoon like a teenage girl in the presence of a young Brad Pitt. It is glorious. The abv is handled easily, and the beer drinks way too easily.
Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its taste. This beer is able to destroy the stylistic guidelines with pinpoint accuracy while sending unique yet appropriate flavoring dancing over top of it. The fruit is wonderfully refreshing and authentic, matching the oak in all of its weird glory whole heartedly. The aroma is just as nice, but doesn’t quite set you up for the seriousness of the sip. The mouthfeel, on the other hand, is out of this world, with just the right amount of dryness to match the juiciness and puckering punch of the fruit, grain, and wood. We’ve been quite excited for this one for a while, and oddly enough this is our first taste of any Rodenbach product, despite the fact that we’ve been accruing a vintage vertical in our cellar for the past several years. This beer might be a bit esoteric for some, but for those that can appreciate it, it is downright delicious. 3,727 charactersTheBrewo, Jan 25, 2014

Nose is so fruity, raspberry, cherry and cranberry for sure, sweet and tart, with a touch of acetic vinegar, brown sugar, and oak. Very fragrant even when cold right out of the fridge. 
Taste is sweet raspberry and cherry before tart cherry and cranberry flavors along with a balsamic vinegar, and brown sugar. A touch of old oak on the finish, with lingering berry skin astringency and sweet fruit. 
Lighter side of medium with some nice refreshing carbonation that lightly pricks at your tongue before scrubbing it dry. Very easy to drink and tasty. 763 charactersnataku00, Jan 24, 2014

Served in a tulip
Gorgeous appearance. The near crystal clear, ruby color liquid was topped by a billowing, light pink, sea foam crown. Super fluffy and finely beaded. The head faded to a thick cap and deposited odd shaped patches of lacing along the glass.
Intense fruity notes dominated the nose. Tons of cranberry, sour cherry, raspberry and strawberry. Slightly funky and tart. Crisp and yeasty. Somewhat candy-like. As the beer sat, more tart qualities came forth. Lemon notes were apparent. Overall, really pleasant, albeit rather one-dimensional.
The flavor profile was fairly similar to the aroma, except perhaps even sweeter. Super fruity with sour cherry and ripe raspberry notes dominating. Some strawberry as well. The fruit additions really overshadowed the qualities of the base Flemish sour ale and lent the beer a slightly medical quality. This reminded me in some ways of cherry cough syrup. Crisp, yeasty notes were detectible. Touch of lemony tartness on the finish. As the beer warmed, some of the base beer's qualities became more apparent. Brown sugar and hints of balsamic and acetic acid appeared. Some oak and tannins came through as well.
The mouthfeel was medium bodied and contained a crisp, lively effervescence. Smooth and frothy on the palate. Slightly foamy.
I love fruit-forward beers, but the fruit additions in this offering completely overwhelmed the base beer and resulted in something that was overtly sweet and rather one-dimensional. If this were merely a fruited ale, I probably would have given it much better scores. However, knowing how terrific the base beer is, and paying $28 for this "enhanced" version, gives me reason to knock it in some aspects. Although most fruit beers are best consumed fresh, this one might actually benefit from some age. 1,906 charactersDamian, Jan 23, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I picked up a bottle of Rodenbach's Cartactere Rouge a few days ago for $22.99 at The Lager Mill. I was looking for something a little special for my birthday and I thought I would take a chance on this one, I think the Rodenbach Classic is a pretty nice beer and i'm interested to see how this one turns out, so lets see how it goes. 2013 Vintage. Poured from a brown corked and caged 750ml Bottle into a Belgian tulip. 
A- The label is pretty simple and not too eye catching, but I think it has a nice classy look to it. It poured a nice and hazy darker red color that took on a great ruby red color when held to the light with a finger and a half worth of off white head that died down to a thin ring that eventually disappears and it left a little bit of spotty lacing behind. This was a very good looking beer, I really liked the color and I have no complaints at all.
S- The aroma starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness that's followed by a huge berry aroma, the raspberrys, cranberrys, and tart cherrys all come through and I think the cranberrys add a unique aspect to the berry aroma that sets it apart and it has a nice tart/sour aroma to it. Up next comes a light funky farmhouse like aroma with a lighter musty aroma mixed in and there's also some light oaky aromas that show up just enough to notice them. Towards the end there's a pretty light vinegar aroma that works well with this beer. I thought this beer had very good aroma, it was very fruity with the berrys and cherrys being highlighted with just enough funky and oaky aromas.
T- The taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma and it starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness followed by all those berry and cherry aspects that I got in the aroma with the cranberrys still adding an extra unique aspect that makes for an aroma that isn't the typical berry aroma. Up next comes some of that funky yeast and it imparts a lighter funky flavors with a slight musty flavor in the background that shows up just enough. On the finish comes the oak with a slight bit of vanilla and there's higher amount of medium tartness that is at just the right level and it had a tart berry like aftertaste. This is a very good tasting beer, I loved the balance between the tart berrys and the funky yeast.
M- Pretty smooth, refreshing, clean, fairly dry on the finish, medium bodied with a good amount of higher medium carbonation that was at just the right level. This beer had a very good mouthfeel, it really worked well with this beer and I have no complaints.
Overall I thought this was a very good beer and I don't have any experience with this style, but I'm pretty sure this is a very good example of a Flanders Red Ale and it reminded me of some of the better funky fruit beers I have had. This beer had nice drinkability, it wasn't overly sour, a little acidic, pretty smooth, clean, refreshing and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I think a full bottle would be a little too acidic for me so I think splitting the bottle with someone is the perfect amount and I could see how this would be a great beer to enjoy in the summer. What I liked the most about this beer was everything, this beer didn't have any weak points in my opinion and there's nothing I can think that would improve this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was how expensive it is, I know it's not cheap to import these Belgian beers, but if the price was lower it wouldn't be just a special occasion beer. I would get this beer again if it saw it, it's very expensive, but I think it's worth it and it makes for a great special occasion beer and I would love to see how it changes over time. I would recommend this to anyone who loves those Funky fruit beers. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, I was hoping this was going to be good for how much I paid for it, but it ended up exceeding my expectations and it made for a very enjoyable beer. Good job guys, this was a great and special beer, thanks for sending some to the USA, keep up the awesome work. 4,060 charactersStoutHunter, Jan 12, 2014

Smell: Tart cherry, that sour cranberry dankness, and sweet raspberry tartness to offset the cherries; it's all there. This is REALLY potent smelling, like freshly juiced berries. Amazing.
Taste: Tart cherry sweetness up-front, with a more bold cranberry sourness in the middle that gives way to a clean and dry, right on the money, sour raspberry finish. It's pretty sour, but not in the realm of Tart Of Darkness sour. Outstanding.
Mouthfeel: Ample carbonation, with a light feel that lends to drinkin' easy.
Overall: Had high hopes for this one, and I wasn't disappointed. I don't like to bring up other beers in my reviews too much, but this reminds me of a certain "intense" beer, but improves upon it everywhere that I'd have liked to see it. I guess that when a company does something for 200 years, they do it better than most. 930 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Jan 08, 2014

Appearance: nice amber-orange hue with a light haze and moderate effervescence. Head is a finger of creamy ivory foam with great retention. Quite good.
Smell: the rich fruitiness and tart Flanders element bring me straight to a holiday meal. Cranberry sauce aside, there's almost a vinous quality here that really works well. This is a fruit beer that cannot be denied.
Taste: very much like the aroma. There's a tartness here which is alluring but not overdone, as well as a grape, cranberry and cherry fruitiness which combine together flawlessly. A really great beer.
Mouthfeel: lightish body with a good level of carbonation. I think it might be a bit overattenuated to be truly creamy, but it is nice.

4.52/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5750ml corked/caged bottle split between two big goblets. If there's a best by, bottled on, or batch number on the bottle, I can't find it. The bottle doesn't look like the photo in this listing. The bottle has clear, plasticky, printed sticker labels.
Pours coppery golden, surprisingly clear, lots of carbonation which clings to the side of the glass but doesn't build into much of a head. Smell is delicious and rich and power, easily detectable at arm's length while pouring the glasses. Sour, sweet-tarty, fruit, just a hint of smokiness.
Taste is sour but not quite jaw clenching, has exactly the sweet-tarty character that I love in a Flanders Red (see Rodenbach Grand Cru). Without doing a side by side, I couldn't compare this with Grand Cru, but it seems like a beer of comparable quality. I think this beer is very fruity. I don't get much from the oak vats mentioned on the label, though. I think primarily I get sour cherry flavor, and lots of fruity sweetness.
Mouthfeel is light and smooth, slightly oily. Overall, this beer is excellent. 1,055 characterssnaotheus, Dec 28, 2013

4.4/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours out a hard to see through red body. Not much of an slightly pink tinged white head sits around well for a sour beer. The Duvel glass is probably helping.
The sour cherries are popping out here in the nose. Lots of big red fruitiness. Some sweetness with vanilla and caramel. Slight musty funk. It is kind of red wine like.
Nice complimentary levels of sour and sweet. Cherry, raspberry and cranberry all pop in the flavor. Some oakiness to it. Not as acetic as some Flanders reds come off as. Very fruit forward.
Body seems a tad thin but overall it feels good on the tongue. Finishes dry.
Such a good idea by these guys to throw some fruit in this beer. 665 charactersMattSweatshirt, Dec 28, 2013

Nice presentation. Pours dark red with a white head that displays surprisingly good retention considering the acidity.
Smells musty, brett funk, fresh berries, cranberry, raspberry, and cherry dominate. Some dark fruit notes; plums and red grapes. A touch of oak. A nice, clean lactic aroma with a touch of vinegar. Much more funk than the other Rodenbachs I have had. 
Taste follows similarly. Musty, earthy, juicy berry character. Lots of fruitiness and a touch of sweetness. Medium sourness that is mostly lactic, but with that touch of acetic acid that gives the signature Flemish flavor. Really enjoy the funk that is present here. Body is not quite as dry as a lambic, for example, and the residual sugars create a nice balance between sweet and sour.
Fantastic beer. I would rank it among the world class fruited lambics I have had. This is a top-tier sour and perhaps the greatest achievement of the Flemish Red style. 960 charactersDanny1217, Dec 22, 2013

A - A vibrant red with a hazy finish and a small white head.
S - A rich, complex mix of sweet and tart berries. Wow!!! So many layers.
T - A moderate tartness with rich, complex berry flavors. The raspberries seem to stand out the most with the cherries second and the cranberries last. Perfect and satisfying.
M - A moderate consistency and carbonation with a huge pucker factor.
O - Pricey but well worth it. This is one of the best sours I've had. 522 charactersGJ40, Dec 13, 2013

Consumed 12/11/13
Appearance: Deep purple - medium brown with a ton of red, pink, and copper - hazy, cloudy - pours with a medium-sized, off-white head, leads some nice lacing
Smell: An abundance of berries - cherries, raspberries, and cranberries are all present here, creates a very rich, bright berry aroma - berry skins, with some fruity sweetness - some rich funk, sourness, musty notes, and wood - some rich amber and caramel malts as well - a touch of vinegar, but mostly this is a blast of fruits
Taste: Berries, berries everywhere - brilliantly tart, with a ton of berry skin - tart cherries, ripe cranberries, fleshy raspberries - fruity and juicy without being really sweet - sweetness is brilliantly minimal - lightly sour, but more tart - funky, with some lactic, musty funk - some nice caramel and amber malts as a base - some nice acidity in a surprisingly clean finish
Mouthfeel: Medium body, very smooth, nice carbonation, very clean for the style
Overall: I don't care if I can't pronounce the name of this beer, it's still awesome
This is an excellent Flanders Red. It's absurdly fruity, and inexplicably clean. I'm honestly surprised at how good this is. Buy it if you see it. 1,249 charactersangrybabboon, Dec 11, 2013
4.36/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Appearance: Dark rich garnet/amber. Head is pale pink and bubbly. Very slight lacing. Nice effervescent carbonation on the pour. Super pink.
Smell: Hyper fruity. Raspberries and cranberries jump out. A touch of jammy fruit coupled with some juicy fresh fruit. Tart cherries add a nice counter to what could be a very sweet beer. A touch of oak running through the back with a mildly acetic edge to the whole thing. Some sweet malts thrown in for good measure. Slight earthiness as well. It's all about the fruit and it's rather delightful. Some hint of damp house yeast. 
Taste: Raspberries and then some. Tart cherry adds a nice counter to the sweet push from the raspberries. A touch of jam sweetness. Cranberry melds in giving it a bit of depth, helping to split the difference between the other two fruits. Oak barrel adds a nice earthy woody element. Some soft earth. Damp and wet basement. Some grass and hay mixed in for good measure. Carries the distinct Rodenbach acetic/balsamic vinegar. Slight yeast presence. a touch floral. Very fruity, but nicely balanced between tart and sweet. 
Mouthfeel: Wet and juicy on the sip. Nice and smooth with a medium body and moderate carbonation. Drinks a bit juicier than is the norm for the style, but given the amount of fruit, it's not really surprising.
Overall: Jax Teller's side business is lucrative. 
Has the base of Rodenbach and then enhances it with delicious fruit infusions. A nice balance of tart and sweet. 1,473 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Dec 11, 2013

4.12/5  rDev -7.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A-Beautiful. A slightly hazed, pinkish hue. Like cranberry juice mixed with seltzer water. A big, bubbly, pink-tainted head grows and instead of fading off, it retains a rather creamy consistency and tall stature. Patchy lace.
S-A very inviting nose. A trifecta of earthy, tart and sweet. The berries are both tart and sweet at the same time. There is a genuine earthen note along with some light barrel influence. The cranberries, raspberries and cherries are all relevant in their on separate way.
T-The flavor is another pleasant mixture of tart and sweet. The berries just control and dominate the flavor. Would enjoy a bit more barrel-induced flavor here. The beer has more of a straightforward (albeit natural and complex) fruit flavor as opposed to a wacky funkiness that pairs with the fruit. 
M-Full bodied in terms of the style; a full, round feel. Tickling bubbles Lingering sweetness and tartness. No booze.
O/D-Very tasty. It just stampedes with tasty berry flavor with a genuine mix of sweet and sour. A pricey 750 but in my opinion, well worth a try at least once. 1,083 charactersVelvetExtract, Dec 06, 2013

A - Mahogany/amber with a short-lived, tan head and moderate lacing.
S - Characteristic Rodenbach Grand Cru aroma but with added raspberry and cranberry. I always get oak, cherry and hard apple cider out of the normal Grand Cru. Very pleasant enhancements. 
T - Tart cranberry with some cherry and a little raspberry, light malt, hard cider, oak. Moderately sour with a typical Grand Cru finish but with some added lingering cranberry. Perhaps a bit less tart than normal Grand Cru with more of an emphasis on the fruit in this one. Very, very nice. 
M - High carbonation and a light body. Dries quickly.
O - A well-done step up from the already-great Grand Cru. Too bad it is so expensive. 734 charactersTucquan, Nov 26, 2013

Great even tone to this one. Raspberries are definitely there. Cherries are also there bringing some sour fruit character also. After that, it's kind of hard to tell if I pick up cranberries here with all the typical stuff that comes with the style. Anyways. This beer is awesome.

4.57/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5With the personal feeling that Rodenbach's beers have always been undermined as a Sour Ale, they've put themselves back on the sour map with Caractere Rouge!
Starting with the same ruby-mauve hue that sparkles in the glass; its dark red hue is largely clear until the yeast cake in the bottle rises in suspension. As a dainty semi-fizzy creme swirls from the calderon beneath, its head character is soon compromised by the beer's acidity and dry body. A quick swirl brings the head back to life to share its high aromatics and then folds back into the glass with minimal lacing power.
Sweetness, tartness, and ooh-so savory aromas align in the nose with a sense of brightness and vibrancy. The fruity threads that pull the beer together are plump and just verbose enough to distinguish its cherry, raspberry and cranberry notes from each other. An overcast of malt is candied with mild confectioner's sweetness and then tempered with balsamic-type acidity. Toasted grain brings out a taste of toast and meek chocolate in order to reinforce its beery-scent.
Crisp, refreshing and savory at the onset, the beer's sweetness and sourness align on the early palate much like "Sweetheart" candy. Its fruit-forward flavor further reinforce that attitude until the middle of vinous red wine, slim balsamic and drier fruit notes bring about the natural earthiness in the beer. Light brine, musty wine soaked wood, dried limes and crab-apples hark to Lambic- but the fruit and light sweetness that accompanies it really bring out those Roeselare characteristics.
Though light bodied but not abhorrently dry, there's ample sweetness and and carbonation to give the early palate sensations a creamy fruit texture. But that's all short-lived as the carbonation bounces off the tongue and carries away with it the fruit and malt sweetness. What's left is vinous acidity that pangs sharply on the mouth in order to refresh it and finish pleasantly dry and warm.
Caractere Rouge is a less vinegary example of Flanders Red Ales but is slightly more fruit forward. I love it that the fruits are sweet enough to discern them from another and not so dry that they all begin to taste alike. That sweet-sour-savory medley shows a balance that's rarely found in Sour Ales. 2,254 charactersBEERchitect, Nov 21, 2013

Nose is a nice mix of the fruits involved. The cranberry sticks out most strongly for me, but the raspberry and cherry are also evident. Some oak, and a little bit of a vinegary scent that suggests some tartness. 
The beer is surprisingly subdued in terms of tartness. Slightly sour, not strongly so. The fruit flavours are very nice. Cranberry, raspberry and some cherry all taste very real and juicy, and blended very well together. The oak is present but, like the tartness, fairly mild, comes out more strongly in the aftertaste.
Medium bodied, moderate carbonation level. Quite refreshing. Slightly astringent.
Overall, really good. Surprising, as the focus is more fruit and less tart, but it works tremendously. 834 charactersjrenihan, Nov 03, 2013

Nice cork and cage that is typical of Rodenbach.
Pours with a reddish hue and one finger of slightly off-white head that dissipates quickly. Very nice lacing.
Aroma of berries and grapes, almost wine-like. A tartness is present that almost says, hey...check this out!
Mouthfeel is thin but spot on for a Flanders red. Very enjoyable. Dry and puckering.
Taste is slightly dry and fruity. Very wine-like. Slightly sweet but predominantly sour. Every sip is enjoyable. Some faint oak notes but maybe because of the mention in the label.
Final thoughts...another home run for Rodenbach. A perfect marriage of sour cherries, cranberries, raspberries and bacteria. The Lacto is present, but there is most certainly a malt presence on the back of the tongu. Nose is perfumy and enjoyable. I will definitely buy a few more bottles. One of my favorite beers to date! 887 characterssb3000, Oct 24, 2013

3.71/5  rDev -16.4%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 3.5Poured from bottle into a chalice glass 
Appearance – The beer pours a lightly hazed reddish-brownish color with a rather thick and billowy pink tinted head. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading and leaving some nice levels of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is biggest of sweeter red fruit smells, with lots of raspberry, cherry and cranberry. While some of the aroma is sweet, there is also a good level of funk, oak, a bit of grass, and a rather potent sour vinegar smell creating a nice fruity tart smell for the brew.
Taste – While there is a sweetness in the nose, there is not so much in the taste. There is a little bit upfront with some lightly sweetened blackberry, cranberry, raspberry and cherry flavors. While a little sweet is there, the flavor is largely of a quite tart cranberry flavor. A rather funky and lightly yeasty flavor is present as well along with a rather apple cider vinegar taste. As the flavor advances the sweeter flavors fade while some oak and a bit of vanilla join the tongue. The tart flavors get even stronger more toward the end with the tart cranberry fruit flavor really taking control of the fruit flavors. In the end, with all the tart cranberry coming to the tongue and a bit of a woody and grassy taste joining the flavor, a dry, funky, somewhat unbalanced, and quite tart cranberry flavor is left to linger on the tongue. 
Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the slightly thinner and lighter side with a carbonation level that is on the higher side. The lighter body and higher carbonation were quite appropriate for the style, helping keep the sour and fruity flavors of the brew from becoming too overwhelming and keeping it overall more drinkable.
Overall – It was OK, but I wasn't too fond of this one actually (at least in comparison the original Rodenbach). This was just a little too on the sour red fruit side for me. An interesting try, and if you are looking for a rather sour cranberry flavored beer then this is definitely one to go too. 2,053 charactersDarkmagus82, Oct 21, 2013

Smell. Tart cherries and raspberries, barrel wood and just a light hint of caramel. Very fruity and delicious smelling.
Taste. Tart raspberries with just a little sweetness, barrel wood (on the fresh side) ...not a whole lot else but what is there is very nice. Tastes like a ton of raspberries went in to this. Really nice.
Mouthfeel. Medium body, medium + carbonation. 
Overall. Elegant simplicity (perfect description from Kathleen). So much fruit flavour for the style which was a bit surprising considering the other rodenbach offerings that are heavier on the sweetness and caramel flavours. Awesome stuff. Thanks again Jeff! 819 charactersRutager, Sep 29, 2013

Really a gorgeous beer - bright pinkish read with a nice beige-pink lace. Unlike anything else I've had from Rodenbach which tends to be heavy on the balsamic/oak, this is much more similar to something New Glarus would brew. Extremely fruit forward - cranberry, raspberry, cherry dominate the nose and palate. A little tart, a little sweet, but a full on ambush of flavor. This was great. 534 charactersdirtylou, Aug 27, 2013

S: Sour, yeasty, spicey, oaky, fruity - of course, that's what you could expect, but here's also a nice sweetness and red forest berries - mostly raspberries, but also some cranberries and lingonberries. Cherries.
T: The exact same thing as in the smell, but the sourness is way heavier, and lovelier. The balance is awesome!
M: Long sour aftertaste with a raspberry-twist - I guess it still gonna be there tomorrow when I wake up. Body is full and carbonation very mild. This is so very smooth!

Cranberry sourness, tart raspberry, a bit of wood and hints of vanilla on the nose.
Lots of fruit up front, some white vinegar in the middle, and an herbal hit to end.
A flash of cream soda on the finish and a clean linger.
Light, dry, no heat.
Made with framboise, kriek, and cranberry.
Fresh and young-tasting, with layered fruit. Somehow has a creamy body even though it's quite lively and dry, and manages to be deep without any sharpness. And elegant an intricate beer.

The head faded away quickly until there was none remaining. The smell was fruity up front with some vinegar notes. I thought the fruity notes were very jam like. The taste followed the smell closely. There was some disagreement about what fruit was in this beer. I thought I was getting raspberries. The beer was tart but it was a smooth tartness. There was a slight sweetness in the finish which was also very dry. The carbonation level was aggressive. Overall I thought this was a very good sour beer, but I could have sworn it was a fruit lambic.

The beer pours a dark, slightly dull rusty brown that shines crimson in the light and provides a fizzling pink head. Although the head fades quickly with minimal lacing, it leaves a thin blanketing/halo throughout drinking. The nose is potently fruity with prominent notes of strawberry and cherry (and celery?) followed by a very refined oak acetone. The taste is Flanders red to the max with huge amounts of description-promised strawb/cherry fruitiness, a touch of caramel and wood. Its medium bodied, effervescent, modestly dry and acidic, fruity, bold, and downright drinkable as hell. I highly recommend this brew for those that enjoy a good Flanders and have had the Rodenbach predecessors. It's an excellent beer, one of the best I've had in a long time actually. 819 charactersThePorterSorter, Apr 14, 2013

A nice faint pink body, slightly clear, and makes a fizzy head picking up the red body color with a pink and tan sort of hue. Some bit of fizz sound when pouring just a "tad".
Oh that nose.. That bouquet is just magic. Wonderful sense of rushing cherry and red fruit bliss with a controlled warming sweet penny candy. It smells like humbugs candy in a glass, exactly like humbugs. Warming tartness but with great yeasty almost champagne/sparkling effervescence which creates a great minty menthol airy aroma. Truly a shove it up your nose brew.
It seems like after that it would be hard to get better. In a way it does, but it is by no means all downhill on first sip. An interesting light almost milky texture, but with classic Rodenbach fruity mid palate and explosive taste. Good sour and tart mix with a nice acidic edge. Carbonation is a bit fizzy but luckily doesn't distract.
Overall, just a pure joy to drink. The irony was I was going to buy a bottle of this overseas and pay for the nose, but thought after I had it I wouldn't have to. Now that I've already done it, I want the dam thing even more, and just may buy it just so I can have it again. Can't stop thinking about it, it's truly a winner. 1,384 characterssmakawhat, Mar 10, 2013

Appearance: Ruby red color. A finger and a half of a light pinkish head which dissipated to a thin collar. Slight haze. 
Smell: Lots of red berries. Cranberry, raspberry, cherry, vinegar, green apple skin.
Taste: Tart cranberries, oak, some vinegar acidity, hints of vanilla and funk. Finish is tart and dry.
Mouthfeel: Light bodied. Crisp. Slightly creamy mouthfeel. Medium/high carbonation. Zero alcohol presence whatsoever. Incredibly refreshing
Overall: I had high expectations going into this beer and wasn't disappointed. The elements of the fruit and base beer work perfectly together without one overshadowing the other.

A: Pours a very dark ruby body with a nice slightly pink head.

T: Sweet cherry flesh, light acetic tartness, a bit more nebulous red fruitiness, drying oak, slight vanilla, lactic and cherry sweetness in the finish.
M: Light-bodied with moderate carbonation.
O: Definitely drinkable and complex, but at this point the cherry sweetness is a bit out of proportion. Maybe with some age the fruit will fade and the bugs will do a little more work. 620 charactersEtan, Jan 24, 2013

Pours a hazy dark red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with some raspberry, cherry, cranberry, and raspberry vinaigrette. Taste is much the same with a nice fruity finish and a slight acidic quality on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is really tasty and easy to drink. 563 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jan 07, 2013

Short pink-hued head that dissipats quickly. Heavy cherry with mild raspberry and cherry. More cranberry in flavor. Super fruity. Moderately tart. High carbonation and super dry. Too fruity at this point, though hopefully that calms down and brings out the base a bit more. Also didn’t have that nice yeast-driven acidity of most Rodenbach yet.

Served from bottle into a Crooked Stave ‘Crooked Line’ tulip. Poured a deep ruby red-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherry, sour, tart, wood, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, tart cherry, wood, subtle funk, and sugar. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. In typical Rodenbach fashion, they knocked this one out of the park. Really complex, tart, and sour all while be refreshing at the same time. While there wasn’t a huge amount of complexity going on here, it was just the right about in my opinion for the style. This made it quite easy to drink and extremely enjoyable. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance, you won’t regret it! 964 charactersthagr81us, Nov 21, 2012

S: A variety of berries were noticeable upfront in the nose such as cherries, blackberries and cranberries but with vinegary character, a little oakiness some acidic notes but honestly has a lot of juice qualities.
T: again plenty of berries like the nose suggest consisting more of cherries and cranberries but once again is more of juice quality more so than real fruit. It did have good oaky character, a little vinegar alongside hints of must.
M: the brew was light to medium in body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a sweet, fruity, juicy, slightly oaky, vinegary and tart finish.
O: it was just a decent flanders. I honestly would prefer alexander better and have real fruit flavor than juice type taste. 839 charactersGobzilla, Nov 13, 2012

Beer is ruby red, clear with a thin head, small bubbles, no lacing, low carbonation. Really bright red.
Aroma is all fruit all the time, very sweet, cherry almost too much cherry, some other stuff sneaks through.
Beer is medium in body and sweet, lots of cherries, lots of fruit, lots of fruit, seriously this is a cherry bomb. Other flavors fight to get through but ultimately fail.

4.12/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a super clear, deep ruby-hued color with a small rapidly dissipating, effervescent light pink head. 
The aromas begin quite fruit forward with ample amounts of dark cherry, various berries and the largest amount of cranberries. The acidic vinegar, leather and earthy oak notes emerge more as it warms. 
The tastes begin super fruit forward as well with a crap ton of cranberry and blackberry flavors, really reminds me of cran-raspberry juice to be honest. Intermingled amongst the sour cranberry fruits are some tart vinegar and acetone that lends to some woody oak and some caramel maltiness but it is all super overwhelmed by the cranberry tart flavors. 
The mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with ample fizzy carbonation. The berries hang around well into the finish with a moderate dose of sourness. 
Overall I was slighlty underwhelmed by the offering to be honest. I was super pumped for it but the sour profile and high effervescence made this seem like a carbonated fruit juice than a Flanders Red Ale. Base beer is really mitigated by the sweet fruity berry flavors with lower tartness than I was expecting/hoping for. Maybe with time this could develop into something but right now it is merely good and not elite as I was expecting. 1,256 charactersclaspada, Oct 15, 2012

From a 750ml into a Borefts tasting glass. 
Batch 2
APPEARANCE: Pours a small, loose, linen-white head with lousy retention. Maroon red body with almost no carbonation evident. Head fades to almost nothing and leaves no lacing down the glass. Looks half decent at best. 
SMELL: Cherries, raspberries and some light funky notes on the nose. Bold enough with some nice citrus and lemon notes over the cranberries, cherries and nice raspberry aromas. Very fruity with a solid, tart-sour base. 
TASTE: Some light funky notes with lots of raspberries, cherries and cranberries on the nose. Some light lemon citrus notes and floral bitterness through the middle into the swallow. A bolder and lingering finish of citrus flavors, lots of tart raspberries and cherries, as well as some light floral bitterness. Good stuff. 
PALATE: A thinner and lighter body, and slightly airy on the palate. Creamy enough on the palate, goes down fine and finishes slightly sticky on the palate. 
OVERALL: A good beer that we thoroughly enjoyed, especially in a hotel room after a 12 hr. beer festival. Lots of good fruit aroma and flavor on this one, though the look and feel could use some re-thinking. An enjoyable brew I'd love to have again. Trade me more so I can open it with you Dennoman.

Bottle shared by Tim a couple weeks ago and again tonight by Cameron. Thanks!
A: Deep maroon with a big pinkish white head that lingers for some time.
S: A ridiculous amount of fruit. There's a really strong cranberry presence (skin and flesh) with some raspberry and a little cherry. Nice vanilla aroma with notes of cherry pie, crust and all. Restrained leather profile with a light mustiness and some oak. Smells like Ocean Spray. Lots of brown sugar. Moderately lactic with some vinegar.
T: A fruit explosion: lots of cranberry with an even blend of cherry and raspberry. Lower moderate acetic acidity with restrained vinegar flavor. Light vanilla with brown sugar and a little oak. The beer is quite sweet with a low level of tartness and a firm lactic presence. The beer finishes with a mild acetic burn
M: Medium body with upper medium carbonation. Sticky, dry, and creamy mouthfeel.
Overall: A nice fruited Flanders-style beer. Too sweet for me to drink a lot of but there isn't a lot to drink so I guess that's not a problem. Reminds me a lot of Ocean Spray or Cran-apple Cider. 1,104 charactersHopHead84, Oct 07, 2012

Reddish pink, crystal clear with no head, this looks nice (despite the lack of head). The nose is super fruity, with ripe red cherries along with the sour Rodenbach base. There is a little bit of acetone, but it does complement the rest of the nose. The cherries are super bright, reminding me in some ways of the Cable Car Kriek.
The palate opens clean and sour with a big, bright cherry character, super bright and refreshing. A little bit of a raspberry-like character is present too. There is a little bit of acetone, but it works on the palate too. Medium light in body, medium high in carbonation, this beer is just fantastic. 784 charactersDefenCorps, Aug 27, 2012

Pour a dark reddish brown color with a smallish off white head that quickly dissipates. Smells of tart cherries, funk, yeast, a bit of vinegar, some sweet fruits, some tart fruit. The flavor is pretty tart up front with some fruity tartness and a bit of acid. The fruit comes in midway to provide some sweet balance before a bit of funk, vinegar, and tannic oak step in. Medium body with a sharp level of carbonation that provides for a prickly mouthfeel. I rather enjoyed this one, its good now, but almost feels like a few years would do wonders to help meld the flavors a bit. 587 charactersjohnnnniee, Aug 26, 2012
4.05/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4750ml bottle split with friends. I decided to do a side by side tasting and open this along with the classic red and the grand cru to analyze the differences in each. Poured into a cervoise, the brew appears pink to a ruby clear color. It displays a polished clarity with orangeish tints around the edges. A finger of pink head sits atop composrf of big bubnly effervescence. A light swirl revives a finger that is quick to dissolve that leaves spots of lace on the glass.
The smell opens big with a fruit quality immediately reminescent of cranberry. Other fruity scents mingle forming a scent that is mildly medicinal and goes right back to fruit especially cranberry with some earth. The aromatics are bright fruits that fills the nose with something almost citrus-like and mixed with orange. A bit of vanilla essence and barrel aging is an afterthought.
The taste is tart with a solid fruit inclusion. Raspberry comes to mind when focusing on the tartness and mild citrus conponents. Lots of funky earth, wet wood/cork keep the fruit in check. A little bit of medicinal quality carries over with acidity. The aftertaselte has more citrus almost like lemon.
This is a medium bodied and modestly carbonated offering. The alcohol is well hidden but the hints of medicinal aspect keeps it from being stellar. I am really taken back by how fruity this is and how much it has altered the base beer. Straight from the pour, it looks fruited and it captures a fruity aromatic quality that filled the room we were sitting in while enjoying this. It was nice to try it and say I had it, but i think i give the nod to the gramd cru as being what I would rather spend my money on. Maybe with some age, as the fruit mellows out my opinion might change but as-is this is a fruity medicinal bugger. 1,790 charactersstakem, Aug 21, 2012

Bright ruby red body, white ring of head on the surface. Aroma is loaded with ripe cherries and raspberries. Slightly oaky. Could smell this stuff all day.
Taste brings even more of the same. Liquified raspberry jam, a good amount of sweetness, intensely acetic too. Hits all of my sour buttons: fruited lambic, unrelenting sourness, flavors are highly concentrated & complex. So delicious!

A - White foam settles to a thin collar, leaving a few stray splotches of lace. Transparent red body.
S - The aroma is a ridiculously intense blast of cherries and other red fruits - perhaps some cranberry in the periphery? There's also some wet oak with a slightly leafy flavor to it, overripe fruit funk, and a sweet malt backdrop. Still, this is all about the fruit.
T - The taste isn't quite on par with the aroma, but it's still quite enjoyable. Lots of jammy fruits and cherry pie, complete with graham cracker crust and a dollop of vanilla. Some mild oak character and acidity in the finish.
M - Super dry and surprisingly light body. Very easy to drink, with refreshing, pleasant carbonation. Didn't realize this was 7% and would have guessed closer to 5%.
D - Awesome stuff - I probably should have ordered more. I crushed my glass and filled it up again before sharing the rest with the SF/Chicago hags. Nice to see Rodenbach stepping up and not merely resting on their laurels. 1,071 charactersMasterSki, Aug 20, 2012

4.12/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 475 cl bottle, batch 2, poured into a tulip glass.
A: Visually stunning. A sea of deep ruby red that gets darker as you go up into the glass. Semi-clear. A true work of art when light refracts through it. Absolutely beautiful.
S: The dominant aroma is freshly picked berries. Raspberry tartness, light sweetness and distinctive cranberry bitterness. This aroma is carried by the classic Rodenbach aroma: refreshing acidity with a touch of creaminess.
T: Beautiful raspberry tartness and puckering cranberry that clings to your tongue. Aftertaste is lactic acid, lingering long on the palate after the swallow. Sweetness goes away completely, making for a strangely sadomasochistic experience that has you yearning for more.
M: Relatively high carbonation, but this is necessary to neutralize the otherwise overly acidic quality of the berries. Though it is very light, it isn't anywhere close to watery and fits the style perfectly.
O: Although I usually don't go for this style, this was an absolute joy. Bags of flavor that keep delivering with every sip, and I would swear something new pops up every time you put this near your nose and lips. Exciting to the senses and perfectly balanced. Everything that's good about summer in a glass.
Inspiring. 1,257 charactersDennoman, Aug 18, 2012

The pour is a lightly hazed ruby color with a pink head. Very nice nose of berries. Cranberry and raspberry are strong, but the cherries are not quite as pronounced. A mild sweetness, not all that vinegary. The flavor has a very strong raspberry note and a more subdued cherry and cranberry profile. Hint of red wine vinegar, a definite sweetness, light oak and must. Really nice. 394 characterswomencantsail, Aug 07, 2012
4.47/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to jedwards for breaking this one out. Pours a beautiful raspberry hue with no head. Nose expresses raspberries and tart cherries. Taste consistent with nose - bold and fruity with a slight tart quality. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a mild, even carbonation, a slight acidity and easy easy astringency. This is a top notch beer, although not sure I would classify it as a Belgian Strong Dark. Not overly sour, very approachable to various taste and there's some definite cellaring potential here. I'd like to score a bottle to sit on for a couple years. 566 charactersJwale73, Aug 07, 2012

The beer is a gorgeous, radiant, dark ruby color, like a gem. A thin pink head rests atop the beer, leaving sparse lacing on the tulip. The aroma is wild and funky, like a fruit lambic. Smells very sweet. Huge raspberry presence, similar to a framboise. Sweet and teeming with berry flavor, balanced by a bit of tartness and wild yeast character. A great candidate for sharing, as the sweetness is a bit much after a small serving. Overall, very tasty, albeit a bit too sweet for me personally. While not my absolute favorite offering from Rodenbach, I enjoyed this. Recommended. 616 charactersHuhzubendah, Aug 05, 2012

75cl (corked and caged) bottle poured into long-stemmed wine glass
Vintage: Batch 1 - produced/bottled sometime in 2011, I think
Enjoyed at DHvL in early June 2012. Somewhat unfair to drink/rate this immediately following the Alexander, but that's how it goes.
A: Medium amber. Half (off-white) fingernail head on vigorous pour.
S: Sour, tart cherry/cranberry, and some funk/must. Oak and raspberry sweetness. Classic Rodenbach nose that is very inviting and rich. 
T: Bold sourness up-front with cherry and oak. Vinegar overtones along with tannins/leather as well as raspberry and cranberry punch (soft sweetness)! At times, the acidity was somewhat overpowering (I think it will age extremely well), but all in all a tasty beer.
M: Medium bodied with low carbonation.
O: Overall a very good beer, but it needs some time to age/mellow a bit (so the tart acidity can work itself out). I think the long-term potential for this beer to be wonderful is very high. I'll be curious to see how Batch 2 (approx. 10k bottle production) drinks compared to this (Batch 1, 900 bottles). 1,095 charactersspdyfire83, Jul 24, 2012
4.49/5  rDev +1.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Récolte 2010, though I'm unclear if that's when it was brewed, barreled, or bottled. This is apparently batch 1. Reviewed from notes.
Appearance - Light red body. Slight gusher of a bottle. Small, off-white head. Murky.
Smell - Bright fruit aroma. Cranberry is distinguishable. Cherry in the form of sour. Raspberry sweetens the nose bakc up. Great fruit acidity and a light malt.
Taste - Maybe a little less fruity than the smell. Still a wonderful fruit flavor. Quality over quantity with the acidity. Just a touch of vinegar, which I can accept in this style. Dry caramel maltiness at the end.
Mouthfeel - The fruit balances the acidity perfectly. Not overly sour, which I prefer in reds. Sufficiently soured, though, as the malt has dried out leaving a medium body and no residual sweetness.
Overall - Impressive all around, but especially the fruit character. Beautifully crafted beer. Don't expect a beat-you-over-the-head sourness. 981 charactersAlieniloquium, Jul 20, 2012

A reddish copper color, poured into beautiful wine-style glasses. Cherry aroma dominates. The beer is quite tart with lot of cherry flavor and an immediate mouth-watering effect. Medium-low carbonation and a slightly sweet linger.
I gotta say, the Rodenbachs killed it on this particular day. #2 beer of the afternoon (after Alexander Rodenbach). 439 characterskscaldef, Jun 12, 2012
5/5  rDev +12.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - a beautiful deep amber colour with ruby undertones. A medium sized dark head that fades at a medium rate.
S - Malty, sweet, sour (a hint of vinegar), hints of citrus. Warm yet fresh and inviting
T - complex, sweet with acidity. The best of its class by far. 
M - smooth with that slight hint of acidity. 
O - an exceptional beer! 337 charactershotsudge, Jun 03, 2012

4.62/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I tried this twice on a recent Belgian trip. At 't Brugs Beertje and De Bistronoom. New rodenbach!
Rose colored with minimal head. Great looking beer. 
A lot of funk on the nose intermingled with various fruit flavors.
You could taste the lactic fermentation from the Foder but it was by no means overwhelming. Tons of cherry rasberry and cranbery notes in the background. Awesome flavor. 
I know little about this beer but I would assume that this a blended beer with at least a small portion consisting of 100% foder beer. Much more lactic than a regular Rodenbach but not as lactic as the grand cru. 
Great stuff. I love the fact that they are experimenting at Rodenbach. Honestly I think that they should do more. Some of the wierd stuff that they have done over years the has been great (Vin De Cereale, Alexander) and I would include this one in that group. 868 characterstendermorsel, Nov 04, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Beertender at 't Brugs Beertje recommended it, 40 Euro for the bottle? Only around 900 bottles for sale from the batch.
Beautiful lacing, dark amber glow.
Perfume like fruit, some raspberry & cherry but the tartness of the cranberries and the house character come out more in the nose.
Tart pucker, soft malt, hint of caramel, bread, wood, bubble gum, cranberry tartness, faint raspberry & cherry, mint, pull of wood which leads to dryness.
Worth the try and the extremely higher price tag, by far one of the most interesting beers I have tasted this year. From the use of different fruits and the wood aging ... epic. 630 charactersJason, Nov 02, 2011
