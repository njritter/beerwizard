4.56/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Finally attained a bottle (b3) of this. The name and description sound on point for what my favorite stouts would be. Best Maple coffee stout I've had to date was Good Morning.
Opened this puppy up and it smelled great. Not as much Maple as I was expecting. Nice and dark. Nice little head.
Took a sip and was expecting Maple upfront. None to be found there. Nice coffee and roasted flavor with Maple
Only hinting in the backend.
This beer is a bit complex which is great, but there seems to be no real balance between coffee and maple. Coffee tends to take over with the roastiness, which isn't bad to most, but I prefer that Maple sweetness to be at forefront of this. The dark roasted flavor with the coffee create a more bitter experience than I prefer.
Not what I was expecting and or hoping for but still excellent. 825 charactersCraftBeerLos, Apr 23, 2017

4.56/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Toppling Goliath
A- pours a deep black color with a one-finger creamy khaki colored head that has short retention before settling into a ring around the edge of the glass
S- aroma jumps out of with a nice clash of sweet maple and smoke.  Undertones of dark chocolate, fresh espresso coffee and roasted malt compliment the maple and smoke.  All of the elements come together to bring the aroma of breakfast in a glass, even elements of smoked pork come into play
T- taste is initially maple-like sweet, before opening to notes of strong fresh espresso, mixed with dark chocolate.  The smoke element kicks in mid-palate, and seems to somehow enhance the maple sweetness.  The finish rounds out the chocolate and continues to kick more smoke, with a linger of sweet maple and coffee
M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into a slightly warming finish
O- an outstanding stout that blends all of the elements quite well.  Although I must admit, I prefer FB's maple coffee stouts. 1,036 charactersTreyliff, Apr 18, 2017

Taste follows nose with a bitter espresso hit on the front end which masks the lovely maple and chocolate that lies below. Mouth feel was overly bitter and on the thin side. Glad i got two pours of this ,its a good brew but will never buy or trade for a bottle , way over hyped and overpriced IMO, Forager Magnus kills this brew. 437 charactersgatornation, Apr 13, 2017

Look:  As dark as they come.
Smell: By god if this this warm maple syrup smell doesn't get you excited nothing will.
Taste: Notes from owner (C. Lewey) and brewmaster (M. Saboe): This beers flavor pallet inverts from a deep bourbon to a sweet maple syrup as it ages. You can tell.  Comparing the 1 year aged from the glass on draft at release event, the aged MD was much thicker and left a better, stronger flavor of maple syrup. 
Feel: Extremely thick, but as smooth as silk. 581 charactersPaulVanney, Mar 20, 2017

The nose on this beer is all coffee at first, with sugary artificial maple syrup popping as the beer warms. 
On the palate, this beer bursts with deep, bold, rich layers of coffee, chocolate, and faint maple syrup flavors. 
Overall, this is the best non-barrel aged stout out there. Good Morning has better maple syrup flavor, and Double Shot has better coffee flavor, but neither can quite surpass the fantastic depth of flavor offered by Mornin' Delight. 699 charactersrodmanfor3, Jan 16, 2017

My only gripe on this one is the mouthfeel.  It was thinner than I expected, but keep in mind I was having side by side with Assassin and Term Oil 4-C, two extremely thick stouts.  I think MD is very good, but a little more viscosity would send it higher in my book. Definitely worth the try if you can find it, but not so sure I would go through the hassle of seeking it out if I wasn't in Decorah already. 611 charactersjphipps83, Jan 14, 2017

The beer pours a deep jet black color, inky and viscous, with a tan head, about two fingers high, solid retention and spotted lace. The aroma is nice, this was served very cold but as it warmed, lots of coffee and chocolate, subtle and smooth maple, stone fruits, roasted and malted grain, really smooth and luscious. The flavors are fantastic, tons of maple and coffee, wonderfully roasted, tons of grain, bakers chocolate, mild fruity acidity, such a balance of flavors, really does remind you of breakfast. The mouthfeel is superb, coating, rich, full bodied, lots of legs and heft, super smooth finish that is lightly dry.
Verdict: A wonderful coffee stout from Toppling Goliath and a real treat to find on tap. Lots and lots of smooth maple as it warms which really compliments the coffee while sitting on a great stout base. A very memorable beer. 919 characterskevanb, Jan 12, 2017

Coffee early on the nose and palate, but warms up to a very nice interaction with maple, also on the nose and palate.

Trader beware! I've had previous versions and the maple is subdued in B3 - really non existent.  The drop off in quality is steep.  Coffee is present but mouth feel is thin.  Previous batches were great but faded in short order.  Not worth the current trade value. Beer is enjoyable but comparable quality can be found on your local shelves. 356 charactersleuk0, Oct 31, 2016

You know it's good when you drink 3 glasses of it. Smells of maple syrup and fresh roasted coffee. Upon sipping, you are smacked in the face with coffee. There's no mistaking it. The secondary layer is a strong helping of maple. It's the right amount of maple, you definitely taste it, without getting too sweet. Nice thick body and goes down smooth for it's ABV.

L: A dark beer with a brown head that looks lovely.

T: Tons of coffee up front.  When it was just poured and still cold - I would only get a bit of maple on the back end.  Particularly if I only took a small sip.  But as it warmed the maple became more powerful - that's where this beer really shines.
F: Thick and viscous.
O - I don't love coffee stouts quite as much as some, but this one is the best I've ever had.  The maple goes so well.

A splendid aroma of coffee, a hint of maple, and a daunting whiff of alcohol. 
I've heard plenty of mythology surrounding TGB's stout mouthfeels, and was eagerly anticipating to be wowed...which unfortunately, I was not.  In fact, I felt it was considerably light by comparison to other elite stouts (Cycle, Cigar City, BA Abrax, Goose Island, J Wake, all thicker).  I was greatly disappointed after hearing so much.  It was smooth and slick, but I seek that chewy, sludgy component of what I consider elite stouts. 
The astringency of the coffee became a standout as I pondered my experience.  There seems to be a fresh bitterness that's rarely or perhaps uniquely captured by this beer.  The maple was only a light undertone, barely noticeable by me.   A supporter might say it's because it's wonderfully balanced and melded, but I'm going to say - I didn't taste it.  I'm a fan of maple components in my stouts with Good Morning and MBP being two of my top three favorite beers, the maple in MD is of no comparison to these two...an afterthought and nearly a non factor.   It's my opinion that Good Morning is absolutely superior when seeking a maple stout by an Iowa country mile.  Maybe the maple served as a sweet component to slightly offset the alcohol bite, but again it's an afterthought vs being showcased.  The showcase here is fresh black coffee and i grew endeared to this fresh bitterness.  
Overall Mornin' Delight is a solid if not strong stout.  I'd order it any time I saw it on tap and would love my order.  I'd encourage friends to get to the bar and have a taste.  It's a great beer no doubt.  It's my opinion that if you seek a maple stout with similar rarity, without a doubt seek Good Morning.  In this experience, MD does not cast this massive shadow over all other beers in this category, its merely good.  While perhaps in the same league as Good Morning, GM is the league champ, whereas Mornin' Delight isn't playing the same sport at MBP, dominated by complexity, uniqueness, and taste.  (In my opinion GNVP is also substantially better...oh, Morning Wood and Sunday Brunch also).  The hype around this brewery has merit but the mythical status is overblown.  I'm an experienced drinker and trader and there are better beers that require far less effort and resources.
Edit
Batch 2 was an entirely different beer.

A: One of the most heralded American imperial stouts ever pours like motor oil, pitch black and viscous. It is topped with a deep caramel-colored head. Together, they look a bit like espresso with the crema. Retention is below average, likely due to the 12% ABV. Lacing is immaculate, however. Carbonation is impossible to note. Alcohol legs are present. Intimidating and inviting at the same time. 4.75/5
A: Woody maple syrup (clearly natural maple) and bitter French roast coffee roast explode out of the glass. The malt actually implies pancakes. Notes of molasses and dark chocolate back up the strong breakfast notes. A little bitter vanilla bean shows up (though this is not brewed with vanilla or barrel-aged) along with some caramel and toffee and deeply toasted sugars. Amazing. 5/5
T: Unfortunately, the strong maple flavor does not carry through into the taste as much as it showed in the nose. It is there, but it is a background flavor to the aggressive French roast coffee, deep espresso, and a surprisingly strong dark chocolate flavor. Vanilla, milk chocolate, burnt sugar, and molasses all play second fiddle. The maple, when it does show, comes through very earthy and woody. The argument could be made that maple is just "well-integrated," but it is a bit disappointing when it is so prominent in the nose. Alcohol is nowhere to be found, and the beer dries up incredibly well for 12%. 4.5/5
M: Here, the beer is a home run. Absurdly thick, sticky, creamy, yet still amply carbed, and with no whiff of alcohol heat, this is what every imperial stout wants to be. Light drying on the back end ties it all up with a bow. 5/5
O: This is a review of specifically the 2016 vintage of Mornin' Delight served on release day at Toppling Goliath. Having had several past batches of MD, this reminds me of one other, weaker batch quite a bit. There have been batches that were truly remarkable in their balance between maple, coffee, and base beer, but this one is dominated by that aggressive roast, leaving maple drowned out underneath the hefty stout character. Of course, even this disappointing batch is above most other stouts on the market, and the maple, when it does show, is fantastic. It is probably not worth what it commands via trading and/or secondary pricing, but honestly what is? This is a premier American imperial stout done like only TG can, and that much is evident in the jaw-dropping mouthfeel alone. Pair with Kayo Dot's "Dowsing Anemone with Copper Tongue" because while it is not "Choirs of the Eye," it is still amazing. 4.5/5 2,601 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Oct 08, 2016

Big coffee notes, burnt sugar, maple, and maybe milk chocolate
Taste follows suit and the beer is sweet. Not cloying per se, but sweet nonetheless. 
Mouthfeel: sticky and viscious, syrupy. Light carbonation and creaminess would do this beer wonders as it would break up that sweetness (or at least take the empahasis away). 
Overall: a non barrel aged beer that in many ways drinks like a one. It is bold, thick, and sticky. Again, good, but for me, the mouthfeel and curb appeal fall a touch flat. 668 charactersbismarksays, Sep 06, 2016

Taste is off however with a great up front coffee and burnt sugar taste that finished with a lingering sour milk flavor. This off tone dies down intensity as the beer warms but is still present. I really wanted this beer to live up to the hype but it fell short. Not even in the sane league as MBP. 407 characterssposter4, Aug 28, 2016

4.63/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Tried sample pour at Huna day. Friendly folks, those TG brewers.
I didn't get a huge burst of maple nor coffee on the nose, but a fairly balanced and integrated combo of the bottle-listed ingredients.
Mouthfeel was rich and thick. It was rather stunning - this impossibly velvety mouthfeel that somehow manages to avoid becoming over-sweet. I don't understand how that is possible, but I would guess it involves a very judicious use of caramel malts, enough hops, and enough chocolate malts to make it work. It is so chocolatey I almost want to describe it as umami...but there's nothing soy sauce-y about it. Rather, just a rich, full, dark aroma and taste that coats and lingers. Like letting a 72% cocoa bar melt on your tongue. 
I can't think of anything that could be done to improve this beer, besides barrel aging it. ;) 828 charactersPDXAmbassador, Aug 24, 2016

A - Ridiculous motor oil pour. I didn't ask but this has to be a nitro stout - dark tan head lingers well in excess of 15 minutes. 
S - Chocolate milk, vanilla, coffee, maple. 
T - Follows the nose. I would say the only knock is the strangeness of the chocolate flavor - it doesn't taste like a deluxe chocolate bar; rather it tastes like cocoa puffs or maybe cheap chocolate milk. But the other flavors more than make up for that, with excellent coffee and maple notes. The flavors blend together, as they should in a well-crafted stout. 
M - Luxuriously smooth with no alcohol burn. Sure it's not thick like sludge but it's thick enough! 
O - This was a nice treat after that bike ride. I am glad I got to try one of TG's legendary imperial stouts! Overall this is a great beer that is quite unique, although I hear some east-coast stuff is similar. I look forward to trying TG's barrel-aged stouts, if I ever can! 1,100 charactersgregy55902, Aug 15, 2016

Huge maple syrup smell but it goes perfect and doesn't make you think it will be too sweet.  In the glass it has an amazing body and the perfect thickness.  The taste goes perfect with the smell the coffee, the maple.  One of the best beers I've ever had.  A true pleasure to drink. 359 charactersfireazzi, Aug 03, 2016

A: Thick black body with a thin cap of fast-dissolving brown foam. Minimal lacing, but great legs. Intense looking beer.
S: Pure luxury. The maple syrup is rich, authentic, and perfectly accented by the roasted coffee and the cocoa depths of the malt. The sweetness never becomes overwhelming, as the coffee is always there to keep it from being the least bit cloying. It's the aroma of the best well-rounded breakfast of all time. Amazing.
T: Follows the nose perfectly. Wave after wave of flavor, with the coffee, maple, and malt taking turns impressing. Everything melds into a delightful semi-sweet finish, leaving an aftertaste redolent of maple. Wonderful.
M: Thick and sticky, fittingly enough.
O: Definitely one of the top 10 adjunct stouts I've ever had. If I could revisit one of the two TG heavy hitters from the evening's tasting, though, it would be Assassin.
Cheers! 989 characterswoosterbill, Jul 30, 2016

4.31/5  rDev -7.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Amazing pitch black color, thick, stains the glass and even sustains a one finger head for a while. Aroma was inconsistent throughout the glass. Sometimes I got a blast of rich coffee with some maple. At other times the coffee was subdued and maple non-existent. Dark fruit is prominent as well. Taste was a let down. Chocolate cake and cocoa are prominent. Coffee is there, but pales in comparison to the richness of the Dos Brunch I had recently. Maple isn't apparent either, but it's well integrated and produces a tiramisu like sweetness. There is a distinct cherry note, possibly from the coffee and burnt roasted malt. The mouth feel is excellent. It could be thicker, but it's still full bodied and smooth. Overall, this is an excellent non-barrel aged stout. It's right up there with Zhukov, Speedway variants, and the lesser Huna vintages. No way is it worth the hype or the price it commands on the trade market. 922 charactersdanh53, Jun 21, 2016

No real head forms even with an aggressive poor. Nice strength to the aroma which for me was mostly maple and some coffee. The flavor is a maple bomb but there is distinct and almost separate coffee flavor which stands alone as if trying two different beers at he same time with blending them. For me it was a very simple beer with perfectly applied adjunct flavors. I wonder what will happen with this beer over time but I wasn't going to find out.

L:  Pours a rich black coffee color with a thin tan head that dissipates into a mocha like swirl on top of the beer.
S: Ridiculous.  Biggest nose I've ever experienced.  You can smell the nose on this beer a foot away.  Huge coffee/espresso, belgian waffle with sweet maple syrup.  Very little of the 12% alcohol comes through in the nose.
T:  Simply the best liquid I've ever drank, period.  Coffee up front with a sweet maple syrup backbone.  Stays on your tongue.  The flavors just linger.  Alcohol is hidden very well.
F:  This is where this beer separates itself from many other stouts I have had.  Thick, chewy mouthfeel that coats your entire mouth.  Like drinking coffee, maple syrup motor oil.
O:  What can I say?  It's the best beer I have ever had.  You understand exactly why this is a top 5 beer in the world.  I drove 4 hours without even thinking about it when I saw this on the taproom list and it was worth every single minute.  A true treat, and a great one to check off.

5/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Was graced with this gem-of-a-beers' presence at the Ale Cheeser event in the TG taproom April 9th, 2016. It has always been a dream to give this beer a try, and needless to say, I was NOT let down by the experience.
Appearance - Strongly resembles a coffee color with almost an oily surface. Upon swirling, there is a visible delay of the beer waves' crest making its' rounds around the glass, teasing the viscosity of this beer.
Aroma - There should be a "Mornin' Delight" scented candle; it'd be a top seller. Perfectly resembles walking downstairs on a Sunday morning to a full breakfast being cooked and served. Unbelievable.
Taste - The only way to describe the taste is actually sitting down to that Sunday morning breakfast, and enjoying maple sausage, pancakes & fresh syrup, finally washing it all down with a sip of perfectly brewed coffee. Call me crazy, but each of those breakfast items' taste were present on my palate.
Feel - Viscous, but velvety and almost oily. Coats the mouth and throat upon swallowing.

The boil for this must be 18-24 hours and a 36 hour brew day total. The coffee is perfectly there, little carb, which is great IMO. Not transparent, even when you tip your glass. The legs fall down the glass slowly. The aroma is a nice sweet coffee + maple mix with roasted undertones of mellowed out fruits. Forget the penny taste, some people don't know what they're talking about. The only thing that could make this better is barrel aging. Hello Kentucky Brunch! 526 charactersClarkee, Apr 29, 2016

4.91/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Appearance - Pours a pitch black with a dark mocha brown head. The head isn't large and the retention is short, but the lacing isn't bad.
Aroma - The aroma is a delicious combination of maple syrup and coffee. The coffee is a little more subtle than I would've expected, but that's a function of the maple being so strong, not necessarily the coffee being so weak. There's a good amount of dark malt as well.
Taste - The taste is a huge burst of maple syrup right out of the gate and lasts and lasts. Honestly, this may be the biggest maple syrup flavor I've gotten out of beer - much more than CBS for sure. As it warms, the coffee comes back with a vengeance and battles the maple, which keeps this from becoming too one-dimensional. If I had to complain, it'd be I'd like a little more malt backbone, but that's a petty complaint.
Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is super thick with a slick, oily body. It's chewy and plays into the flavors perfectly.
Closing Arguments - Overall this is another fantastic stout from Toppling Goliath. I have to say it's much different than I expected since I thought the coffee would dominate, but I love all this turned out. 1,160 charactersnhindian, Apr 19, 2016

Black, with a minimal tan head.
Huge maple on the nose, with coffee in the background.
Flavor follows through exactly the same, which is a nice surprise. Maybe a little more coffee here than on the nose.
If you're going to do maple, you need to make sure we can taste and smell it. Too many beers advertise it, but they don't actually showcase it. I'm just a little wary whether they are using corn syrup and flavoring to achieve this, or real maple. It's not clear on any of the official brewery marketing. 543 charactersSabtos, Apr 04, 2016

Pours a dark brown with a tan head.  The smell was great on this beer, lots of black coffee, and the unmistakable smell of maple syrup.  The taste was spot on with the nose.  lots of coffee, but even more of a sweet syrup taste.  some molasses in there also.  This was a real creamy beer, with a nice mouth feel.  Was very happy to have finally tried this beer.  It is not the best maple stout I have tried, but damn close. Quite amazing! 454 characters-Rick, Mar 14, 2016

S: Deep notes of chocolate, caramel, and toffee on the nose; for me the coffee aroma was very subtle
T: Intense rush of molasses and bitter dark chocolate up front that effortlessly melts into a complex syrupy sweet rush of caramel, maple, latte, and mocha; the finish is moderately dry and accompanied by a lingering sweetened coffee flavor
F: The mouthfeel on this beer is incredible. It's as if the viscosity from the syrup and depth of the latte are imparted into the stout 
O: Just an immensely pleasurable ride from start to finish. In my opinion, this beer deserves its place among the top beers of the world and takes non-barrel aged stouts to new depths. Obviously barrel-aged beers are all the rage at the moment, but between Mornin' Delight and Good Morning, I'm glad to see that brewers don't need to age a beer for more than a year to impart a plethora of flavors and complexity. World class stout here for sure. 1,105 charactersFireman_RK, Feb 15, 2016
5/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Finally got the chance to try this one thanks to DJ (happy birthday!).
Look: Thick and creamy appearance, with a minimal head and little lacing.
Smell: Like sitting in a pancake house as pots of coffee occasionally walk by. No alcohol in the nose, and absurdly balanced; the coffee is there but doesn't dominate whatsoever, and maple, while the star of the show, isn't overly sweet and doesn't block out other flavor.
Taste: Like a giant stack of pancakes with maple syrup and  a sip of coffee afterwards. Coffee is present but not dominating. As someone at the tasting pointed out, 'this is like Trader Joe syrup, not Aunt Jemima's'. Alcohol content is hidden and as a whole Mornin' Delight is very complex and perfectly balanced. This is one of those beers where you end up taking very small sips and letting them coat your mouth to draw out the experience.
Feel: Smooth and creamy. Leaves a coating of flavor in your mouth that persists.
Overall: A fantastic beer that met the very high expectations I had for it. Compared to a similar beer like fresh CBS, I give it the slight edge for better balance and a bit more complexity. As others have mentioned, the amount needed to trade for a bottle is a bit silly, but I'm certainly planning on dropping everything and booking it to Decorah next time a release comes up. 1,324 charactersRistaccia, Feb 14, 2016

Another reviewer said it looks like a Willy Wonka Chocolate River.  They were right, but it's definitely more viscous.  Smells nice and chocolatey but I was hoping for a little more aroma.  Taste is sweet chocolate with smooth tasting coffee and a bit of maple.  The maple is not the major player here but is definitely noticeable.  The mouthfeel is top notch with a smooth,  creamy, easy drinking well hidden abv experience.  Overall a great stout.  My only small criticism is that it's a little bit too sweet. 613 charactersELS, Feb 14, 2016

The smell of this "beer" is like a rich breakfast. There is maple syrup, coffee, roast, pancakes, chocolate croissants. The taste is full on maple with coffee, vanilla, roasted malts, chocolate. 
There is so much going on in this brew, incredible that all these flavours can get into a beer! 410 charactersKaeF, Jan 25, 2016

4.48/5  rDev -4.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Let me start off by saying, I am reviewing this a couple weeks after I had it, so I won't be as descriptive as I'd like to be. 
I split this bottle with a few friends in what turned out to be a pretty amazing impromptu share with the likes of DBH, Pappy's, and many other highly acclaimed brews. While this was certainly one of the highlights going into the night, it didn't live up to the hype for me personally. Don't get me wrong, it is a great beer and definitely one you should try if you can get your hands on it but I wasn't blown away.
The motor-oil-esque color and strong coffee nose were the best features of the beer for me. Huge coffee (obviously) and a smooth, creamy mouthfeel was nice too. The taste was very good, but I expected more due to the hype. Funky Buddha Morning Wood is in the same realm, IMO and you don't have to give up nearly as much to obtain some. 
Would I pick one up if I saw it available on the shelf? Duh, of course. But, would I trade away the farm for another bottle? No. Glad I had an opportunity to try it though. 1,056 charactersyumbeer, Jan 19, 2016

For this beer- mouthfeel is exquisite like all TG stouts. Taste was more coffee dominant than I hoped for, maple was definitely playing second fiddle. Very good, absolutely not better than KBBS, and I'm shocked anyone thinks that. 321 characterslinnymtu, Jan 02, 2016

About a 5oz pour from a 22oz., 2015 Bottle.
Look: Pours a pitch black, with very little (espresso colored) head.
Smell: A coffee/maple syrup explosion. The most amazing smell ever to come out of a beer bottle. It lingers, + it's fantastic. 
Taste: Tastes just like it smells.....maple syrup the whole way through, with that coffee roast finish. 
Feel: A thick, syrupy feel, which laces every inch of your mouth with the taste. 
Overall: Hands down, the most amazing beer I've ever had. Perfect in every single way. 629 charactersHarryS, Jan 01, 2016

Pours an oily, black color, with a medium, dark brown head to it, revealing huge bubbles within a spongy head. Coates the side of the glass after swirling with alcohol legs, small bubbles and an oily film, showcasing the thickness of the beer.
Smells of warming syrup, wrapped up by cold pressed coffee beans, together with scorched, earthy malts. Atop of that foundation settles a nutty and raisiny quality, both adding to the potent coffee appearance. Milk chocolate enriches the luscious, sweet maple syrup, with coffee cutting through in a flowery, slightly wooden fashion. The most beautiful thing about the aromas is their perfect balance in combination to its outstanding intensity. 
Drinks outstandingly smooth, soft on the tongue with a lower carbonation to it, presenting the beers huge body perfectly. Even its profound coffee bitterness during the finish is not able to distract from its creamy softness, maintaining its fantastic thickness.
Tastes of oaken, multi layered espresso bean, pungent, while offering a pleasant, mellowing sweetness, which gets beautifully enhanced by the syrup. An early, dry coffee bitterness goes hand in hand with earthen, toasted malts and a brewed coffee sourness, almost completely wrapped up by the malts. Into this coffee sourness blends the rich maple syrup, creating an intriguing flavor depth, soothed by whipped cream. During the beers finish, its profound coffee earthiness returns to the palate, while bitter chocolate compliments it, together with perfumy, alcohol soaked praline.
While featuring chewy, sweeter qualities, the beer reveals an awesome balance, due to its mvp, the coffee. It is incredibly rich and exhibits both, sweeter and bitter qualities by itself, accentuated by syrup and malts. Its mouthfeel makes this truly great, maintaining a remarkable silkness on the tongue, while the beers rich, thick body is challenging the tastebuds throughout, in the most pleasant way, coating my tongue for minutes after each sip. 2,017 charactersaleigator, Dec 23, 2015

4.83/5  rDev +3.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 22oz bottle received from the very generous RyanJohnCrain.  Thanks Ryan!  Consumed over Thanksgiving.  Aroma hit me from a few feet away and instantly made me think of chocolate chip pancakes.  No clue why.  I've never had them or seen them before...but that's what this beer smells like.   Taste is delicious, and you get a nice balance of chocolate, maple and coffee.  However, not as much maple as I would have thought, and it doesn't have quite the same degree of fudgey maple taste as Good Morning does.  I had 2-week old GM a week later and thought it was a noticeable notch above this.  However, unlike some people on here, I'm not trying to make a huge political point here by pointing out how this beer could've been better, so while not perfect, it still gets good scores.  Anyone giving this beer below a 4 either has no appreciation for this style at all, or is simply trying to skew the ratings b/c they've concluded it's overhyped. 959 charactersNYC-IPAnAPA, Dec 09, 2015

4.9/5  rDev +4.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52015 vintage. Poured from a 22oz bottle into a 2015 Mornin' Delight tulip glass. Acquired in a trade with PaulG, thank you very much. Opened in celebration of my marriage. Drank over the course of ~1.5 hours, allowed to warm over that time. 
Pours a thick, oily, viscous, jet-black body right out of the bottle, producing a deep mocha colored rising head that reduces fairly slowly, sticking around for a while to leave light lacing and eventually a ring of mocha retention. Looks exactly like a stout should look. 
The aromas are potent and present the second you open the bottle, but naturally get more pronounced as this stout warms up. They peak just below room temperature. Anyway, the maple syrup is astounding, incredibly sip-inviting and ever present without smelling artificial or forced. The sweet maple goodness mingles greatly with a fresh coffee bean aroma - think freshly ground maple coffee. In the background is a dark chocolate aroma, vanilla, and caramel. 
As if the aromas weren't heavenly enough, the taste delivers a massive punch to the taste buds. A perfectly balanced medley of maple syrup, freshly ground coffee, cocoa, and dark chocolate are what I'd expect a chocolate covered maple coffee bean to taste like in liquid form. On the follow through is a sweet, rich chocolate-vanilla flavor reminiscent of chocolate cake, followed by a delectable charred, roasty, dark chocolate-cocoa bittersweet note that sticks on the tongue for a few minutes. 
What sets this beer apart from others, and really pushes it to the next level, is the mouthfeel. Rarely have I tasted a beer as thick, rich, full bodied, and full of delectable flavors as Mornin' Delight. The carbonation is medium-light but definitely present. 
What can I say? This beer has everything.. it looks awesome, smells like breakfast in a bottle, tastes heavenly, and feels like liquid fudge, therefore I give it a the same rating as my favorite beer of all time, Good Morning. I give it a 4.75 for taste because it may be literally a hair too sweet for my liking. It was the closest to perfect I think can be achieved in that category. Worth the hunt, try it fresh! 2,155 charactersgcamparone, Dec 01, 2015

A: Dark and thick. Creamy, heavy dark brown head.It really looks amazing, like a fresh brewed coffee.
S: Smell is coffee forward with an awesome balance of maple syrup. Some vanilla helps balance the strong coffee also. Very powerful, balanced and intoxicating nose.
T: Taste is a little bit disappointing. Strong coffee, maple syrup and vanilla but quite unfocused. It gets better as it warms, with cocoa and maple being more prominent and giving more balance to the beer. This beer needs to mellow but I don't think it could get better over time as the strength of the coffee and maple syrup would necessarily fade.
M: Bold and strong. Too much actually. The good thing about it is alcohol can absolutely not be found. Still, this is very sweet and sticky.
O! I really wanted to love this beer but I'm a bit overwhelmed. This is a good brew but not actually not so special, at least not on par with its reputation. Coffee and Maple syrup are not as balanced, for instance, as they are in Maple Bacon Coffee Porter.
I had this again (same batch), with an extra year on it, and I proved to be wrong, ageing did benefit to this beer. Nose was maybe a little bit less powerful than the first time I had it, but tatse was more mellow and better integrated. Maple syrup and coffee have not really fade away, which is pretty impressive. I actually enjoyed it more than the '14 KBBS we had side by side. Rating is based on a mix of both tastings. Thanks Anton for bringing this to our tasting! 1,537 charactersFux, Nov 07, 2015
4.05/5  rDev -13.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75Okay so before rating this beer I must say that this is by far amongst the top OVER RATED beers on here.  The spot that it claims on the top 250 list is ridiculous.  I don't think this is a bad beer at all, just why so high.  This beer is my 1,620th beer I've ever had. Maybe the people rating haven't had enough to know what a good beer tastes like? or just fan boys pushing value higher and higher to claim ultimate whaley status. 
Shared a 22oz bottle with 4 people and they all agreed
Look - Dark brown to black.
Smell - Okay this is the most phenomenal thing about this brew.  Smell is coffee forward with an awesome balance of maple syrup. If it actually tasted like how it smelled it would be the best thing I've ever had.
Taste - Light coffee in comparison to what i anticipated and maple taste comes through decent. Doesn't get to the point of cloying.  Big problem is that you can taste the Belgian sugar that they used to get the abv up and its a big turn off taste buds wise. Cheap way to get abv up but also bring a characteristic not very pleasing to your palate
Feel - Medium to thick mouth feel. A bit sticky on the glass
Overall - If you haven't had many whale status beers and you haven't had over 1k brews there is a good chance that your palate will think this is God like. I would say that if I would have had this too early in my craft life that I would be in the same boat as many of the reviews on here say.  This is why ratings should only count by people who already know what good beer tastes like and have had enough experience to back it up. Ultimately this is a solid brew that I would never care to try again especially for the left and right nut that I would have to give up for it.  If you want to try something with coffee not barrel aged like this that is mind blowing, then go get yourself some Treehouse Good Morning. FRESH Good Morning not passing more than 5 days age and you will see how this brew is completely inferior in every way except smell 1,986 charactersRaziel313, Nov 07, 2015

Really nice variation between chocolate, maple and coffee. Coffee and cream flavor predominates. The only major flaw is a bitterness on the finish that appears left over from the coffee. Excellent, but not quite at the very top of my list for an Imperial Stout. A tad overhyped. 400 charactersjjdc, Oct 09, 2015

5/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Call it homerism, but this beer is an absolute heavy hitter and worth every penny for the price of admission. You get a huge boom of maple and chocolate as soon as you crack the bottle open. It is hard to believe that this beer isn't barrel aged by how much flavor they seem to pack into the bottle. The pour is, of course, motor oil thick and it sticks to the glass like it never wants to slide back down. I think the only thing I can say against it is that it is such a big beer and you need to share it with your friends. If you don't have friends, find some strangers. This beer will put any soul brave to slay it down to his knees like Ahab on on the starboard side of his catatonic vessel. Approach with caution, thar whale be fierce in its might and ready to do the Wakey Wakey Eggs and Bakey tango with your tastebuds, bud. 831 charactersZacharyIsom, Oct 05, 2015

5/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5UPDATE 10/26. Had a chance to try this again and during the day this time, side by side with Tree House Good Morning 8/20 batch. The pour was in fact so viscous in the light that rivals SR71. Mouthfeel this time was incredible, significantly thicker than GM and not as sweet as GM. It has become my favorite non-BA maple coffee beer of all-time. Upping my rating to 5/5. 
Poured not as thick as I thought it would be, especially compared to SR71. Very little head, but that's mostly because the pours were small (3oz-ish). Smelled AMAZING! HUGE coffee and maple, perfectly played together. Taste followed, but didn't mesh as well as the small. Some sips were full of coffee, other was dominant with maple. Mouthfeel was velvety, thick, but not quite the incredible mouthfeel that KBBS delivered. 
I've been really spoiled with TG stouts, having been able to try them all multiple times. I made a mistake of going in with major expectation, so in all fairness, the bar was set really high. I loved it, but it didn't blow me away. 1,030 charactersmythaeus, Sep 22, 2015

4.69/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75For my tastes, superior to KBBS, SR71, and Assassin. Appearance is spot on; opaque, viscous, black with dark brown accents, an espresso like head of brown shot through with amber / mahogany tones. Ring of brown foam clings to the edges of the glass. Aroma is a blast of maple and coffee, a bitter roast note at the end. A bit one dimensional though; I like a bit more malt presence and the adjuncts obscure it. The flavor, though, brings back the roasty malts, chicory and charred oak impressions though not barrel aged, maple pecan / praline flavors. The one criticism I have is it's a pretty straight forward coffee profile. It simply says "coffee" and I feel like you could get more nuance from a more studied application. There's no risk involved in this coffee choice. Feel is close to perfect - chewy but not as coating as the BA versions that really overwhelm you. 871 charactersKurmaraja, Sep 20, 2015

From the minute you open coffee and maple in your face.
Dark , thick ,and soooooo smooth. The coffee and maple battle for dominance but they are so well blended that you taste them both the whole way down. Maple does win it out at the end with a sweet after taste that coats your mouth. 
Woke up and smelt the bottle this morning and the maple was still so strong. Never had anything like this.  forget the hype train the is the real deal!

3.95/5  rDev -15.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Bottle from the source. Consumed at room temperature.
Pretty nice beer here, kind of overpriced at $30, but it is what it is. Poured thick, dark brown-black in color, with a small chocolate head that receded to a thin ringlet, apparent lower carb. Light roasty coffee in the nose, notes of brown sugar and liqueur-like booze. Pretty good balance in the taste, smooth coffee, lighter notes of maple candy, some neutral booze...definitely a bit hot, there's no doubt this is 12%. Sweet, but not diabeetus sweet.  Suffered in the mouthfeel, which was quite thin, even at room temp, and the higher booze and lower carbonation didn't really help.
Overall this was an average coffee stout. Good, no question, but not great. There are many many better beers out there in the same vein, but with the value this one gathers on the secondary and/or trade market, it's pretty obvious people are going to rate it up to justify the overpricing. 933 charactersRifugium, Sep 12, 2015

L- Jet black with thin tan head, motor oil thick that laces the glass.
Smell- Good lord. I love coffee, but I would be absolutely addicted if I could make coffee smell like this. Dark roast coffee without any burnt or bitterness. Maple syrup and a little fudge brownie. 
Taste- Follows the nose perfectly to me. Rich full bodied coffee without out any hint of bitterness throughout. Chocolate brownie comes across in the middle and the end is all delicious maple syrup. Very rich, but does so without being overly sweet. 
Feel- Velvet smooth. Maybe even chewy?
Overall- This was exactly the beer I was hoping it would be. Having tried most other highly sought after coffee stouts, both barrel aged and non, MD is the king for me. Loved being able to try Good Morning the night before and while a great beer, it is just not on the same level as MD. The complexity and balance on this beer is truly amazing. Well done TG. 968 charactersjoecool0909, Sep 10, 2015

The look, smell, feel and taste of this beer is everything that you would expect - black poor with a nice tan head.  Smells of 6 am - medium roast coffee, dark chocolate and maple syrup.  It takes a moment to actually drink this beer as it's a beauty to look at.  
The taste, is basically the smell - rich, creamy mouthfeel with a solid balance of coffee, maple syrup and chocolate stout.  
Again, this beer meets all of the hype and is everything you would want in a big stout.  By far, one of the best beers in the world, barrel aged or non-barrel aged. 655 charactersJsnyd05, Sep 10, 2015

5/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at Dexter's in Madison and at Toppling Goliath at release.
Minimal tan head which dissipates quickly.  THICK, and sticks to the sides of the glass for an eternity. 
The smell.  My god, the smell.  Absolute perfection.  Rich, sweet and chocolate, with a pronounced coffee note.
Taste - A perfect blend of sweet coffee goodness, with vanilla.  Given the high ABV, it was surprising that there was virtually no heat to the beer.  Coffee flavor is much softer than one would expect from the nose, and continues to become less prevalent as it warms.    
Mouthfeel is SMOOTH and THICK.  Take your pick of a viscous liquid to compare it too -- motor oil is probably the closest, however.  Perfectly chewy, it clings to your hard palate in a wonderful way, letting you hang on to the flavors a few seconds more. 
After having Good Morning the night prior to my second time with MD, it is clear that MD is in a category all its own with this one.  The only beer I've had that tops this is was 2013 KBBS, and that was an exceptionally close call. 1,048 charactersCentinela, Sep 09, 2015

Look:  Thick, viscous, black with a light tan head.  Motor oily thick
Smell:  Maple syrup and coffee.  Very strong coffee which slowly becomes more and more maply as it warmed.  Really amazing.
Taste:  Just amazing.  The balance of chocolaty roast, coffee, and maple syrup is quite exquisite.  The maple really opens up as it warms and it just seems to get better and better.  Drinkability is crazy here being a 12% beer.  Goes down so smooth.
Mouthfeel: Thick, viscous, and smooth.  A little chewy too
Overall an amazing beer.  Well worth the 4 hour drive.  My first of the big TG stouts and I cannot describe how amazing this beer was.  The maple was simply amazing. 720 charactersrabbott2, Sep 09, 2015

5/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a 6 oz tulip glass - Thanks so much for sharing Nathan!
A - Jet black, 1/4 finger of a mocha, khaki looking head.  Pours viscous, like motor oil.  Sludgy, thick, sticks to the glass, with alcohol legs everywhere.
N - A maple bomb.  Amazing how much maple is in the nose.  Roasted coffee (think of the smell when you walk into a coffee shop like Starbucks), chocolate, buttered pancakes (weird, I know).  It smells like breakfast in a glass.
T - Drop the fucking mic.  Maple explosion, chocolate, coffee.  Amazing.  One of the chewiest beers, ever.  Thick, sludgy.  Ever had jamocha almond fudge ice cream from Baskin Robbins?  You tastes that in this beer. Brownie batter.  Milkshake consistency.  Truly mind blowing stuff.
O - this just might be the best beer - any style - that I've ever had.  They hype is real.  #HUNNITS 840 charactersjow_42, Sep 08, 2015
5/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The nose is incredible. The freshest roast of coffee amalgamated perfectly with sweet and dark chocolate to balance the bitterness of the roast. The taste supersedes the nose if one can believe that. A lot of coffee stouts albeit good... tend to portray a roasted bitterness, which I do not mind necessarily, but Morning Delight goes beyond the realm of balance. The real player in this beer is their signature soft and pillowy mouthfeel, similar to Treehouse GM, but a bit more viscous due to the ABV.  This is easily one of the best beers I have ever had. I had it next to Morning Delight, which is just as good, if not better, but lighter and sweeter. These are both perfect. 678 charactersWynnDavis, Sep 08, 2015

Looks dark and oily, minimal head.  Very thick.  I wish every Stout looked like this.
This beer smells amazing.  Maple dominates, followed by coffee and chocolate.  (I keep smelling the bottle long after the beer was gone, it smells THAT good.)
Such a great tasting stout.  The coffee is strong but complimented by the sweet rich maple syrup.  Chocolate and vanilla round out the flavors.  Perfection.
The thickness puts this beer in a league of its own.  So rich, thick, viscous, creamy and it coats your mouth with deliciousness.
Overall, this might be the best beer I have ever had.  I would love to drink it again, side by side with KBBS to see which is better. 748 charactersWI-Beer-Man, Sep 07, 2015

Jet black color and thick like motor oil. Nose was strong with coffee, maple and chocolate. I don't drink coffee but loved the smell and taste with this beer. Taste was not overpowering and but for me the stronger feel was with the maple. Did not taste any heat with this beer and felt like they balanced it perfectly. This was overall the best non-barrel stout I have ever had and probably close to my favorite beer. Being from Kentucky I love the bourbon flavor in the BA stouts and I wouldn't sell this one short. Fantastic beer and glad to know I have two left! 683 charactersWeezieBone, Sep 06, 2015

5/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Let me preface, I don't give many perfect scores out, but this is just ridiculous stuff.  
On Tap at Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight Day, multiple pours.
Look: Oily, viscous, borderline sludgy. Head foams up with a mocha-dark khaki head. Lacing and legs for days.
Smell: Maple. Maple. Maple, coffee, waves of chocolate. This is a beer I could smell for days. 
Taste: Sweet sticky maple doused chocolate covered coffee beans. Pure decadence. Absolutely mind blowing. There's even a buttery note (not diacetyl) that comes through almost like creme-brulee. 
Feel: Viscous, creamy, thick. Words don't describe this mouthfeel. 2nd only to SR-71 for Stout mouthfeel IMHO.
Overall: Many folks have said this isn't as good as 2013, they're wrong, it's better. More maple, more coffee, just completely delicious. Worth every penny. Would I give up a 12 bottle shipper for one? Doubtful. No beer is worth that.

As far as taste, the maple and coffee are both huge.  I have no idea how Mike manages to get this much maple in the beer.

The aroma/taste reminded me of slow drip coffee from single origin coffee beans blended perfect with maple syrup.

This is an unbelievable non-BA stout. Amazing maple and coffee nose. It was too bitter right away, but thickened up and mellowed out as it warmed up. Great beer. 
This is a hair behind Assassin and SR-71 for me, as the barrel adds a ton to those beers. This is right up towards the top, however. 350 charactersKSHunt, Sep 01, 2015

The look is just what you'd expect from a TG stout, amazing. Just looking at it you can tell the mouth feel is on point. The head is minimal and presents a deep tan color. The way this beer coats the glass is like no other beer I've seen. The entire glass is coated in sweet maple stout by the time you're through. 
The smell is very coffee forward but you begin to pick up the maple as it warms. In my opinion this is the only area where this beer slightly lacked. We had Good Morning the Friday before and the nose on that beer had a lot more maple. But once MD warms up a bit, it honestly smelled like pancakes...
The taste...heavenly.  You get a bunch of coffee upfront and subtle maple notes towards the end. Once you let this bad boy warm up for a bit, it completely changes the complexity of the beer. The maple becomes much more pronounced. They say to drink fresh, I'm not saying to age it for two years...but I feel six months to a year will only add to the character of this stout. 
The feel of the beer is hands down one of the best I've had. It's super thick and viscious, leaves almost a resin type feel in the back of your throat. This is where MD blows GM out the water. Again we had GM the evening prior, and everyone agreed it was a great tasting beer. But after having MD, it was a unamious vote for Toppling Goliath. 
Overall, this was the best non-BA stout I've ever had the pleasure of trying. Frankly I never write reviews, if I do, they're typically a few sentences long. I'm not one to over-hype a particular beer, but I'd definitely put this in my top 5...maybe top 3 best beers I've ever had. Maybe I'm a bit biased because I'm a big fan of maple coffee stouts. But you will not be disappointed. I had every intention on trading one of these bad boys prior to the release...after having it, I don't think I could trade for another beer (despite KBBS) that would be on the same level as this. 
TG keep doing what you're doing. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to try this amazing beer. 2,075 charactersAkkveto09, Aug 31, 2015

The beer smells amazing, absolutely amazing. Smells like you walked into the kitchen of someone cooking breakfast. Tons of maple and coffee in the taste. This beer is very sweet from the maple, but not in an overpowering way. The coffee notes helped to cut down on some of the sweetness, but to me the maple was the predominate taste. 
The mouthfeel was unlike any other beer I've ever had. Insanely thick and chewy. Overall this is the best Coffee Stout I have ever tasted, and it is hard to imagine how it could be improved. 710 charactersBobloblawlawblog11, Aug 31, 2015

L: Very dark, no light gets through this one.  As the beer moves around the glass, it coats and sticks to the side, pretty sure my chalice is permanently brown.  Thin caramely head with good retention.
S: Huge maple and coffee nose.  The entire taproom smelled like brunch during the release.  Most aromatic beer I have had.
T: Maple not as big as nose would suggest, but still huge and controlling.  The roasty coffee comes through amazingly as well, chocolately roasty, not bitter roasty.  The beer is extremely smooth, would not guess it is a 12% stout.
MF: Amazing.  Absolutely perfect viscosity/thick feel for a non BA stout.
Overall: Hands down the best adjunct stout I've ever had.  The bottle count on this is significantly higher that the last run, so get your hands on one if you can.  Another heavy hitter from TG. 882 charactersillini1848, Aug 30, 2015

A - Dark with a hint of lighter brown on top
S - Strong coffee and maple smells. Couldn't stop smelling the beer. So good. 
T - Does not taste like a 12% beer. Goes down so smooth with the coffee helping overlay the sweetness of the beer. Can taste the coffee up front with the maple and carmel/chocolate. 
M - Chewy, sticky, stuck to the glass as it's swirled around. 
Just a great all around beer. One of the best there is. I love CBS and this is right there. I'd love to taste the two next to each other. MD has a little more of a coffee taste to it and I can taste a bit more of the maple. This is a must taste. TG doing great things. 686 charactersgovlady, Aug 30, 2015

L: Motor-oil black. Coats the inside of the glass which I LOVE seeing in stouts. Dark brown head that sticks to the edges mostly. 
S: Coffee. Straight up roast and some chocolate I think. It's hard for me to tell because the coffee is quite strong. You can tell it's going to be sweet though.
T: Strong roasty coffee. Hits like a truck and then fades as it warms in your mouth. This is when the maple comes through. Sweet. Very well balanced. There is a slight booziness here as well that's quite warming. 
F: Thick. Perfectly carbonated and smooth. 
Overall the taste reminds me a lot of my grandfather's maple syrup. While definitely a sipper it's hard to believe this is 12%. This is everything a coffee stout should be and more. Definitely stands up to the hype. Mike, you made one helluva beer! 945 charactersApatschinn, Aug 30, 2015

This beer is...HUGE.  Massive flavors right from the get go, and that's after a wafting yourself a great nose with typical morning-in-the-kitchen aromas.  Coffee is on point.  As one who doesn't drink coffee (but appreciates coffee stouts, go figure) there is a perfect balance of said coffee and masterfully blended maple syrup...and tasty chocolate.  
This beer is very rich and definitely a sipper...but enjoy the hour it takes to properly down a healthy pour of this masterpiece. 
Every once in a great while....the hype is real. 595 charactersB-Nut-GoBlue, Aug 30, 2015

5/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5From the 2015 release. Very dark chocolate color with a nice lace.  Tried it chilled right out of the keg then let it warm up for 10-15 minutes.  The flavor and aroma really came out after it warmed up. Very strong smell off coffee and maple but not over powering. One could barely tell this was 12% ABV until the slight buzz started to set in. This beer was delicious and by far the best stout I've ever had. 409 charactersTroutmen, Aug 30, 2015

Had this again at the TG vs Surly tap war.   Might have even been better than at the event.   So mapley delicious.! 342 charactersTravitten, Aug 30, 2015

More head than I was expecting that is a deep caramel color. The aroma is a bomb of maple and coffee. It tastes like a glass of creamy coffee with tons of syrup poured in. The beer is almost chewy and coats your mouth and teeth. Truly spectacular and lives up to the hype. 357 charactersmayxday, Aug 30, 2015

The smell is a strong maple, with the head being similar to the color of maple syrup, maybe a bit lighter. Absolutely packed with coffee and maple. By far the best imperial stout I've ever had. No noticable alcohol bite for being such a high ABV. This is incredibly smooth. Quite the treat! 341 charactersAwolter, Aug 29, 2015

Hell, this beer is very sticky. Taste was huge coffee. Can’t understate how much coffee flavor is in there. Probably more than the average extra dark roast coffee from the local coffee cafe. Has lots of sweet maple flavor to cut through the coffee. One thing I didn’t like was that is was kind of tart. This might have been the coffee though. Still, I didn’t care for the tart taste. 499 characterskkleu357, Aug 18, 2015

Tasted like heaven! maple, coffee, chocolate, nice barrel flavor, with a hint of booze near the end. Full mouth coating, It was the perfect beer to  drink with donuts. Overall I loved this beer and I am super happy to get invited into the release party on the 29th this month. 529 charactersRyanJohnCrain, Aug 16, 2015

This is the most well crafted coffee stout I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. 
It is like drinking an espresso with hints of maple goodness thrown in for added complexity, that only becomes more delightful as it warms, my only complaint is that I couldn't have more!!
After trying this I can't wait for more opportunities to taste what else Toppling Goliath has to offer. 439 charactersSuds_With_Buds, Aug 13, 2015
4.9/5  rDev +4.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52015 batch on draft at Dexter's in Madison.  Dark and brooding with a strong maple/coffee nose.  You can tell it is thick just by the lag as you swirl it.  Taste is maple and sweet up front with a strong, slightly bitter coffee finish that lingers.  Super thick and chewy.  The maple smell stays in the glass for days afterward.  One of the best stouts I've ever had.  If you don't like coffee or sweet in your stouts, this  may not be your thing, but definitely worth the experience! 484 charactersIowaBiertrinker, Aug 13, 2015

Strong coffee aroma complimented by rich maple, bitter dark chocolate, and vanilla sweetness to even it out.  Probably the richest flavor and texture I've ever experienced. The maple and vanilla came together seamlessly with fresh coffee grounds being potent without dominating the beer. Lips literally stuck together after each savory sip. A treat to try it at Dexter's at a very orderly event. 461 charactersKFBR392, Aug 13, 2015

Had it on tap at Dexter's in Madison today and it was worth the wait.  Wasn't sure I'd ever have this and it lived up to the hype. 410 charactersMilwaukeeBeerMaker, Aug 07, 2015

5/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5'13 Mornin' Delight from the bottle still drinking great two years out.
Pour - Pours like black motor oil as do most of the TG stout. No signs of significant carbonation on the pour as there is barely any head compared to '14 KBBS which was poured along side.
Smell - Vanilla, Maple, Coffee, Cocoa are the predominant smells it is giving off.  Almost like chocolate chip waffles coming off the griddle
Taste - I get vanilla sweetness followed by chocolate and coffee.  The tail picks up big with the maple.  One flavor leads way to another, well layered beer.  Flavor profile reminds me of BA Vanilla Shake, but jacked up on steroids and more depth.
Mouthfeel - Motor oil like thickness and consistency is the first thing you notice.  Allows you to almost chew on the beer as you mull over the flavors in your mouth.  Exactly what I love in some stouts.
Overall - Don't throw many 5's out, but this beer has everything I'm looking for in terms of  thickness, mouthfeel, flavor, and aroma.  Perfection at it's finest and preferred it a bit over the '14 KBBS side by side. 1,075 characters4lo, Aug 01, 2015
5/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had it on tap at the TG release on Saturday 8/29/15. The look is just what you'd expect from a TG stout, amazing. SUPER GREAT MOUTH FEEL!!!The head is minimal and presents a deep tan color. The way this beer coats the glass is like no other beer I've seen. The entire glass is coated in sweet maple stout by the time you're through. The smell is very coffee forward but you begin to pick up the maple as it warms. In my opinion this is the only area where this beer slightly lacked. We had Good Morning the Friday before and the nose on that beer had a lot more maple. But once MD warms up a bit, it honestly smelled like pancakes... The taste...heavenly. You get a bunch of coffee upfront and subtle maple notes towards the end. Once you let this bad boy warm up for a bit, it completely changes the complexity of the beer. The maple becomes much more pronounced. They say to drink fresh, I'm not saying to age it for two years...but I feel six months to a year will only add to the character of this stout. The feel of the beer is hands down one of the best I've had. It's super thick and viscious, leaves almost a resin type feel in the back of your throat. This is where MD blows GM out the water. Again we had GM the evening prior, and everyone agreed it was a great tasting beer. But after having MD, it was a unamious vote for Toppling Goliath. Overall, this was the best non-BA stout I've ever had the pleasure of trying. Frankly I never write reviews, if I do, they're typically a few sentences long. I'm not one to over-hype a particular beer, but I'd definitely put this in my top 5...maybe top 3 best beers I've ever had. Maybe I'm a bit biased because I'm a big fan of maple coffee stouts. But you will not be disappointed. I had every intention on trading one of these bad boys prior to the release...after having it, I don't think I could trade for another beer (despite KBBS) that would be on the same level as this. TG keep doing what you're doing. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to try this amazing beer. BEST STOUT I HAVE EVER HAD!!!! 2,059 charactersBeerCrazyCrow, Jul 14, 2015

Smell: Extremely fragrant with maple syrup, bourbon, and loads of chocolate on the nose.
Taste: Dark roasted cocoa, strong coffee, maple syrup, bitter on the finish which strikes a wonderful balance with the maple syrup sweetness.
Feel: Medium body, wish it could be a little bit thicker.
Overall: Fan-freaking tastic beer. As a concept beer this really captures the spirit of a delicious morning at a pancake house. That is, if you're having bourbon with your meal! 578 charactersGet_Lowell, Apr 23, 2015

5/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served on draught into a MD Snifter on release day. Consumed over 2.5 hours to allow the beer to warm to ambient temperature. 
A: Midnight black with a 1 finger mocha head. The beer is completely opaque.
S. Initial smell is huge freshly roasted coffee with maple lingering behind. It's been overdone: but this smells like pancakes on a Sunday Morning. 
T: Immediate coffee up front, completely dominated the initial taste. Eventually gives way to a sweet maple flavor that is anything but artifical. I feel that allowing the coffee to mellow for a few months will do this beer wonders.
M. Thick as can be. Coats the glass with beautiful alcohol legs the same way it covers the mouth. Impossibly big mouthfeel.
O: this is great. Having had b1 aged, but not fresh, I urge you to hold onto the bottle for a month or so to let the coffee not be so overwhelming (not that it's a terrible thing) 894 charactersHawkeyePA, Feb 08, 2015

A: Beautiful, oily, viscous, dark, syrupy pour into my teku with a perfect foam head. 
N: Waffles. Syrup. Coffee. Breakfast. By far the best nose on a beer I've ever smelled. By Far.
T: Waffles, pancakes, syrup, sweetness, breakfast. Honetly, this is the best tasting beer I've ever had. And the complexities are ridiculous. Your mouth gets hit with waves of flavors through sipping this beer. I just can't believe a beer can taste and smell like waffles!
M: Perfection. Nice, oily, syrupy that coats the palette beautifully.
O: This is the best beer I've ever had. For being non BA and the complexities that ensue is ridiculous. This is the first time where i was genuinely upset to finish a beer. I need more of this beer in my life! 799 charactersjaken0ss, Aug 27, 2014

Taste is coffee forward, with just the right amount of maple and dry chocolate.  Despite the prominent maple, not as as sweet as Assassin or SR-71.  Just outstanding--best coffee stout I've ever tried. 314 charactersmarkcp, Aug 11, 2014

A: Pours a blackish-brown color with dark, fine, espresso-like head which forms a thick ring. Good, thick head sticks around a while.
S: Loads of rich maple syrup, along with charred tobacco and some dark chocolate bar. Wonderful. 
T: Moderately sweet maple syrup, strong RIS-like roast, some tobacco, and a bit of mouthwatering dark fruit. 
M: Soft, medium-light carbonation and medium-full body. 
O: A bit cloying, but tasty and has an amazing nose. Akin to dumping some maple syrup in a roasty RIS. Good in small doses, though not overwhelming in subtlety or complexity. 604 characterspmarlowe, Aug 10, 2014

The beer is dark brown with an oily thin head. Aromas of whiskey, vanilla and coffee. Oak and whiskey. Mild heat. Huge malt bill with bourbon atop coffee. Roast character throughout and quite smooth on the palate. My least favorite of the three and it's still world class. What?!? 325 charactersHuhzubendah, Aug 09, 2014

From a 12oz bottle into a snifter
Batch 1
Bottle 4 of 3000
APPEARANCE: Pours out black and thick, yielding a smell, medium looking, creamy, dark mocha colored head with great retention. Jet black body with no carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a swirly wisp and bubbly ring. A faint wisp and ring remain leaving some falling dots of lacing down the glass. Thick black body and a great head, and just a touch more lacing would give it a perfect score. 
SMELL: Lots of maple, caramel, roasted coffee, sweet vanilla cream and loads of dark chocolate on the nose. Very bold and well put together, with the adjuncts working wonderfully well with the base stout. Decadent. 
TASTE: Lots of maple and coffee up front, with some nice dark chocolate from the base beer. Very flavorful through the middle with a big, bold and lingering aftertaste of roasted coffee, sweet maple syrup, vanilla, caramel and butterscotch, with a dose of bitter dark chocolate providing balance. Lots of sweet maple syrup and other sweet flavors with bitter coffee and chocolate lingering on the palate. Excellent. 
PALATE: Fuller body with medium levels of carbonation. Very creamy on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes slightly sticky on the palate. A light burn at the swallow and some heat lingers, but well measured. Great feel. 
OVERALL: Well, here's one case where the rumors are actually true. KBBS is another case, actually. This is one outstanding adjunct stout, with flavor and aroma all over the place all working in perfect harmony. Loved every drop of this. The look was great and the feel big, thick, creamy and full, making this just a wonderful creation overall. Too bad so little of this was made, as I'd love to drink it by the bucket full. This one is just as good as everyone says it is. Thanks for the brews cparles. Morning Delight deserves every single piece of praise it receives. 2,027 charactersJeffo, Jul 09, 2014

The aroma is incredible. A punch in your face of espresso, rich roasted coffee, along with some sweet maple syrup and chocolate. A beautiful melding of that bright bold roast along with sticky syrup sweetness.
The flavor follows with this beautiful interplay. The roasted espresso coffee in the front, dark chocolate and chewy brownies, then onto a kick of smooth maple.
There mouthfeel is medium plus and silky smooth.
I actually did not realize that this was not barrel aged. It has this creamy vanilla and beautiful mellowed transition that barrel aging adds to beer. This reminds me of KBS on steroids. Easily the best coffee stout out there, one of the best non-barrel aged imperial stouts imaginable 772 charactersdar482, Mar 24, 2014

One of my faves at the fest. Flavors is complex including licorice, sweet roasted coffee, bourbon. Aroma is simply stunning, a nice balance is struck between sweetness and coarseness of the stout. Very drinkable considering the ABV, super creamy. I need a few bottles of these. 299 characterspapat444, Mar 24, 2014

S-Sweet Jesus what an aroma. Unbelievable intensity. Loaded to the gills with coffee and more specifically, espresso. Maple syrup by the gallon. Rich chocolate. Shockingly strong.
T-Perhaps the most indulgent stout I have ever tried. Coffee and espresso. Roast and some lighter burnt flavors. Pure maple syrup. Melted, dark chocolate. The flavors are ridiculously rich and intense. Incredibly impressive.
M-Like drinking maple syrup. Oily, syrupy and chewy. Booze hidden too well. The feel was one of this beers highest points.
O/D-This was a 'must try' for me. Toppling Golitah loves up to its lofty billing. The best stout I have ever tried. It's very unique. It's also masterfully crafted. So rich and delicious. 762 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 23, 2014

The taste is big and bold and smooth too, matching up perfectly with the welcoming aroma and the dollop dropping body. Flavors include milk chocolate, coffee, well-incorporated maple syrup sweetness and just some toffee. There’s something additional here too, a doughy cookie batter chewiness, that sets it apart from other stouts that have those traditional coffee-milk-chocolate aspects. Rich and smooth in body, motor oil heavy and moderately carbonated. 572 charactersjbaker67, Mar 22, 2014

This beer looks like black coffee- a fairly typical appearing imperial stout with a dark black body and fluffy 1cm mocha head that dissipates slowly into a brown collar, no film. Lacing looks great, and the beer is oily and stains the heck out of the glass and probably my teeth. In other words, a black coffee-like stout.
The aroma is really something. I'm going to call it black espresso spiked with maple syrup. It's intense and so strong. I just want all my breakfast meals to smell like this. However intense it is, its still a two-trick aroma. I can't get a whole lot of that underlying malt base, if there is even one.
Honestly an amazing tasting beer. Tastes like pancakes smothered in maple syrup and coffee. Here, the base malts make its contribution known and the balance on this is phenomenal. Both the maple syrup and coffee are so intense yet complement each other well- the maple sweetness and the espresso flavours on top of the underlying chocolate roasty malt backbone. It must have been a hell of an endeavour to brew this beer. Very well balanced yet the individual flavours are so intense.
Mouthfeel is medium thick, not thick like BCBS but not thin like a lot of other stouts out there. It is just right for this kind of beer. It's very sticky- my lips are stuck together after I lick them- as maple syrup would be. It's really well-balanced, drinkable and enjoyable. Aftertaste is a blend of coffee and maple syrup, as if it takes time for the coffee and maple syrup to start coming together in your mouth. 
Very delicious beer, really good stuff. I think what makes it so great is that it has the intensity of two different, competing flavours yet they take away nothing from each other. It's overhyped to be sure, due to its incredibly low supply vs the high demand for a delicious beer like this.. I know TG's expanding so I'm not going to ding them hard here and give them credit where it's due. It's not a particularly thick or complex beer, but at this point who cares? I just want this beer with breakfast every morning.
Re-visited at Toppling Goliath's tap room in Decorah, IA. Two full 12oz pours into unlabeled chalices today, 3/8/2014. Basically, it supports everything I got out of the 4oz pour at Dexter's as reviewed above. Straight out of the tap, it's very coffee forward remniscent of Bourbon County Coffee's coffeeforwardness. But if you give it a few minutes to warm up, the maple syrup comes out big time and balances out the coffee-forward nature of the previous few minutes. And if you give it even more time, the maple syrup begins to dominate a bit. Throughout, there is a nice pancake batter sweetness that helps cut both of the otherwise-dominant adjuncts. Neither adjunct flavour is artificial or overwhelming. It's perfectly balanced and perfectly crafted with a nice sticky finish as one would expect from a maple syrup stout.. it does feel a bit thin for a beer that has maple syrup though.. may even be a bit undercarbonated. No heat at all, so dangerously drinkable. This is as good as it gets when it comes to non-barrel aged stouts with any kind of adjunct.
Re-re-review. On tap at Toppling Goliath on MD Day, 8/29/2015. Served in the commemorative Mornin' Delight chalice. This was savored on the heels of the Great Taste of the Midwest earlier this month, when things didn't seem quite right with the beer being served at the festival (I did not attend the Dexter's event the day before). Poured a thick dark black body, two finger thick brown head, really nice retention, sticky rings of lacing which I can only presume come from the maple syrup component. Smells of bitter coffee and rich maple syrup which comes out more as it warms. A bit of chocolate and a nice roast malt base that complements the coffee well. On the flavour, it's a nice balance of maple syrup and coffee; as before, it's very coffee-forward initially with the maple coming out more as it warms. It's not too complicated, but the flavours balance very well which I imagine is why this beer is considered to be so enjoyable to drink. If everyone could do it, why aren't more brewers doing it? Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, pretty substantial, but with a moderately bitter coffee aftertaste to balance out the sweet maple and base stout. They served this one too cold, and I felt that you needed to let it warm up a bit for the full spectrum of flavours to come out. Overall, I'd have to say that it's drinking as good as it has always been, and is as impressive as it has been in the past before all of the recent turmoil. It's still not a beer I would give up the farm for, but I'm fortunate in that living in relatively close proximity to the brewery, I don't have to do that. 4,806 charactersStevedore, Mar 09, 2014

A - Dark as night with light tan mocha head with minimal lacing

Look: Pours pitch black with a subtle mocha colored head. The beer literally looks like motor oil and leaves a dark sugary residue on the glass. 
Smell: Nothing but the highest grade coffee and the most mapley dark amber maple syrup. Quite honestly one of the best smelling beers I've ever had in my entire life. 
Taste: Where do I even begin? Absolutely oozing with maple and coffee goodness and some excellent roast bitterness on the back end to round out the tantalizing sweetness. One of the few beers where the taste follows the smell and executes it perfectly. 
Feel: Thick, slick and creamy. But the slight bitter roast cuts through the sweetness on the tail end, leaving the drinker with a want for more.
Overall: You simply can't ask for a better beer, if you enjoy sweet coffee stouts this is one that should not be missed. No shame, one of, if not the best beer I've ever had the privilege of drinking. I tried the first bottled batch back in 2013 and trying MD again further cements how much much I love this beer. Thanks Mike and everyone over at TG for this amazing opportunity. 1,208 charactersDaftPatrick, Feb 28, 2014

A little vanilla and marshmallow, a fair bit of malt sweetness in back but abrupt. The wood in kbbs added a lot, this gets just as sweet without the bourbon. The coffee is still really clean and nice for a coffee stout. The body is very creamy and the carb is light. 510 characterscpetrone84, Feb 02, 2014

A- Pours jet black and thick with a thick brown mocha head that retains well and leaves some good lacing on the glass. A great looking stout!
S- Smells of rich dark chocolate, black strap molasses, roasted malt and coffee, as well as hints of toffee, dark fruits (figs, dates, etc.), and booze. Also a good amount of burnt sugar. There are some other aromas that I can't identify due to the incredible complexity. Simply glorious!
T- My first thought when I initially sipped this was "This is simply decadent!" It is so rich with the sweet flavors coming from the chocolate, molasses, burnt sugar, and dark fruits. There are also some caramel and creme brulee flavors going on. All the sweetness is pretty well balanced by the bitterness of dark and baker's chocolate and coffee. Also bringing balance are the dark roasted malts and the roast from the coffee. Make no mistake though, this is still a very sweet and decadent beer! I could nit-pick, but this is damn near perfect, especially considering it isn't even barrel aged!
M- The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, but slightly prickly from the carbonation. Not very viscous, but still coats the palate. A bit of warming booze.
O- Overall this made my Christmas morning utterly delightful! For a non-barrel-aged stout this is astounding! Well done Toppling Goliath! 1,356 charactersSadMachine, Dec 28, 2013

Bottle split blindly with Kyle
Morning Delight is nothing if not a very unique and interesting beer. Super sugary sweet, overloaded molasses and maple upon a massive wave of fresh roasted coffee. Mouthfeel is thick, rich, and coating. Pancakes in a glass is more than appropriate...drinks batter-like with a big cup of coffee tossed on top.
What Morning Delight gives in a very interesting and huge take on a breakfast style stout, it takes in the cloying, rather difficult beer to work through. Blasphemous perhaps, but this beer is really too much and could use a little reigning in. A beer to be shared for certain. Would I like to try this beer again in four packs that may be more readily accessible? Sure. Is this worth trading away a bunch of great beer just to try? If you're a glutton for punishment, over-trading, or instant cavities, then by all means. 899 charactersBarrytheBear, Oct 18, 2013

T - So, yeah. The taste of this is like heaven. God must exist. This is definitely the best beer I've ever had. Funny to me that KBBS has a higher rating, because I can't imagine how. This beer is better than a 5/5. Just get it.
M - 12.8% or whatever, might as well be non-alcoholic. There's no booze to be found here. Creamy, full bodied, yeah, perfect.
O - The best beer I have had. It's perfect. I'd drink this all day long until I died. Luckily (or unluckily?) they don't produce enough for that. Need to have as much as possible of this in the future. Can't recommend enough. 923 charactersnrs207, Sep 29, 2013

This mega-delicious imperial stout drinks like an imperial Canadian Breakfast Stout, and its bottle release quickly put Toppling Goliath on the radar for those who had not yet heard of them. I have had this brew a few times prior, but I felt it was time to finally write this one up now that I had a bottle of my own to sit back and enjoy
Score: 99
2013 vintage bottle served in a Toppling Goliath snifter and enjoyed on 08/31/13 while on vacation in the Wisconsin Dells for Labor Day weekend.
Appearance: Pours an inky black color with a thin later of khaki head that settles to a thin ring around the glass. Below average lacing, but excellent retention. Very nice looking stout. 4.5/5
Smell: Bold notes of roasted coffee, chocolate chip pancakes and maple syrup! This smells like a hearty breakfast in a bottle. Love the interplay of the sweetness from the maple character and the roastiness of the coffee. I could smell this beer alll dayyy longgg. 5/5
Taste: Taste is less coffee forward, but still pretty roasty. Excellent bittersweet balance here between the chocolate flavors, maple and coffee characters. Tastes exactly like it smells, but with less coffee and more chocolate pancake flavor. The flavors linger long on the palate, with residual maple and coffee. No alcohol booziness whatsoever; are we sure this is even 6% let alone 12%?!? Not too sweet at all, which aids the drinkability wonderfully. The maple flavor layers quite nicely as well. 5/5
Mouthfeel: Not quit full bodied, low carbonation. Super slick, oily mouthfeel with a slight umami feeling at room temperature (but no soy sauce flavor). Nice bittersweet balance leaning towards slightly sweet. 4.75/5
Overall: This beer is fresh CBS on steroids; it smells and tastes wonderful. I have to give a big shout out to my friend Matt for insisting that I check out this then-unknown brewery at the Great Taste of the Midwest in 2012, as Toppling Goliath consistently produces some of my favorite stouts and IPA's (my two favorite styles). Morning Delight is one of my all time favorite beers, and probably the best non-barrel aged stout out there. I think just a touch more body is all the more I could ask for, but this beer is by no means thin bodied like Last Snow. Seek out a bottle. You will not be disappointed. Cheers!
Cost: $10 for a 12 oz bottle. 2,455 charactersjegross2, Sep 12, 2013

I have only been aware of Topping Goliath's existence for about four months but they are already one of my favorite breweries as everything I try from them has been excellent. I can add Mornin' Delight to that list after trying it at The Great Taste of the Midwest this past weekend. I can't say that I loved it as much as some people do but it is an interesting beer that you shouldn't need much more than a few ounces to get your fill because of it's thick texture and sweet taste. 
I have heard people reference coffee, syrup, pancakes and chocolate when describing the taste of this beer and all of those things were definitely present in this beer. It was a great treat for sure but the sweetness got to be a little too much after awhile so a bottle of this might best be shared with friends! 910 charactersmjpolzin, Aug 11, 2013

Yes. It is absolutely worth the hype. Over and over.... 
The pour is dark, thick and creamy... Like a cup of fresh coffee
Smell is rich maple, coffee, chocolate... Best smelling stout I've ever had. I love the smell of ba abraxas...but the maple in this beer makes you want to keep smelling it for ever.
Taste, oh the taste. Rich coffee, maple, chocolate, and some dark fruits... The alcohol is perfect! It's there but not in the way at all. 
Mouth feel is smooth and creamy. Again... It's just hard to describe this beer.. It perfect in every way!
Mike (brewmastamike) you have created a master piece with this beer just like the rest of the beers you have created. From ipas to American stouts....keep up the work! And we will keep drinking your amazing beers!
Quality beer with quality people brewing it! Perfect beer! I don't see how this beer can be better but I guess if there is someone to top toppling Goliath, it will probably be themselves. 991 characterscmdmzmjm, Jul 29, 2013

Overall, this beer deserves all the praise it receives. It is equally as good as KBBS in a different way. Whereas KBBS has the bourbon and a touch of sweetness, MD has more coffee and maple characteristics. Best coffee stout I have tried, bar none. 281 charactersthebigredone, Jul 02, 2013

Appearance - Inky black with a small mocha head. Wisps on the surface. Stains the glass nicely.
Smell - Whoa. Coffee and maple. The maple is incredible. Dark chocolate. Like a giant Maple Bacon Coffee Porter.
Taste - Coffee is more prominent. Strong coffee and even a bit abrasive. Delicious maple. Dark chocolate. Boozier here too. Coffee lingers in the aftertaste. Even a little smokey in the aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel - Chewy. Nice and thick. Medium carbonation. 
Overall - This is delicious. Smells better than it tastes but it's pretty damn good. 591 charactersAlieniloquium, Jul 02, 2013

Pours pitch black with spotty lace, huge, oily legs, and almost no head. Decent.
Nose is just as advertized. Super robust chocolate, maple syrup, cocoa, fudge and coffee. Delicious!
Opens maple sweetness. Espresso and milk and dark chocolate in the middle with hints of plum, raisin, and other dried dark fruit throughout. Lactose at the end with a boozy, sweet, chocolate-y finish. Great balance, incredibly deep, and super robust. This is pretty incredible!
Full bodied with low carbonation. Slick, oily and rich in the mouth and goes down smooth and heavy. Messy finish with a lingering aftertaste. For the style and the flavors present here, this is very nearly perfect. 
I've heard a lot about this beer and this brewery recently and after having a taste, I gotta say that I'm clamoring for more. The flavor profile here is at the same time so well balanced and so robust with a body that carries out the experience perfectly. You feel every bit of the ABV but you can't help but want more. A ridiculously good offering. 1,113 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jun 24, 2013

 Awesome beer-goddess Chelsea served this top-notch nectar in the 11 oz. TG chalice, for an amazing $8. Give the beer a quick swirl and you get a great coffee aroma that I haven't had the pleasure of inhaling off a beer ever. Fantastic nose appeal, really hard to stop inhaling the incredible aroma of this beer. Top notch.
 The appearance has to wait until you get a few sips in, because at Toppling Goliath, your cup over floweth ! Your glass is REALLY filled to the rim, every time ! But once you get down a bit this baby really coats the glass, just the way you want, and it is every bit as black as the other big coffee stouts.
 Your mouthfeel will be as expected once you sip it, and smell it, you know it will be thick and very smooth, velvety, as it most certainly is.
 When you take your first taste , you almost immediately want to scream out " Oh My God " but you resist until you have given it a good tour around your mouth and palate, so as to take in this incredible explosion of taste, then you can let out your high praise of the great flavor of a not-barrel-aged beer. This is the undoubtably going to continue to be a top want of mine forever, if you haven't or can't get to taste it, just keep trying, these guys will be expanding and continuing to make more of this, keep it on your wants - totally way worth it.
 Overall - I think you get my point. My top 4 beers ever tasted, in no order, Rare , Grey Monday, Mornin' Delight, Bourbon Barrel Dark Lord. 1,657 charactersstouts4me, Jun 02, 2013

4.96/5  rDev +6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5I've never had enough CBS to give it a full review. I have had enough, however--at festivals and tastings and other places where tiny pours are given--to know that it's not worth the exorbident price it goes for on the trade market. It's a very good beer, yes, but... man, when I heard about a barrel aged syrup beer, I had a certain idea in mind. I wanted it to taste like a combination of the way an RIS tastes and the way a plate of breakfast smells right when it's placed down in front of you. CBS didn't deliver on my fantastic desire. And that's not it's fault. No beer could. 
Or could it... (?!?!?!?!)
Mornin' Delight does deliver. It is exactly what I hoped CBS would be: pancakes, and stout all rolled into one. Nothing cloying, nothing overly sweet or alcoholic, just a wall of delicious breakfast flavors. 
Maybe--maybe--this is better without the bourbon aging. We were one day early for the Kentucky Brunch release, so I can't say, but I'm willing to bet that the bourbon smooths out the syrup nodes, rather than accentuate them. Maybe that's what happened with CBS? I dunno. I do know, however, that this is one of the very best beers I've ever had. 1,167 charactersmynie, Jun 01, 2013

A - Thin dark mocha foam settles to wisps, specks of lace, and a thin collar. Loads of bubbles adhere to the sides of the glass. Black body with a glass-coating film to it.
S - Massive maple and coffee aroma, with touches of roast, and hints of anise and dark chocolate. Very nice complexity for a unbarreled stout. As it warms the sweetness verges toward cloying, but it never reaches that point for me.
T - The taste has a bit less coffee and roast, perhaps to the beer's detriment. Loads of maple and caramel sweetness - awesome for a few ounces, but it'd take me a long time to work through a 12oz bottle. Alcohol is extremely well-hidden here.
M - Chewy, sticky, smooth, with a tiny bit of coffee grit to it. Lower carbonation, and big, viscous and full in body. Not much alcohol warmth at all for the listed 12.8%. Spot on for the flavor profile.
D - The taste starts to border on maple syrup after a while, but in a good way. Quite delicious in small doses; I can imagine a bourbon barrel might impart some needed balance, and it seems that Toppling Goliath agrees with me. Definitely worth checking out, particularly if you like CBS. 1,334 charactersMasterSki, May 21, 2013

Jet black with a coating on the glass when swirled, gently bringing some mocha foam to the surface. Can't really see through it, though there's some lighter shades of brown around the edges. 
Aroma is just about perfect, maple syrup, coffee, and chocolate chip pancakes in perfect harmony. Rich but not too sweet, each component is distinct, completely authentic, and mouthwatering
Potent and rich, fudgy mouthfeel with flavors that linger and coat the palate. Big coffee and maple syrup flavors, undercurrent of bittersweet dark chocolate fudge. Perfectly blended and balanced. Alcohol is present but takes a backseat to the flavor parade. I suppose it may be too sweet for some, but with a name like this, it should be obvious. An expert mix of maple, coffee, and chocolate, beer alchemy at work here... definitely beats KBS in my mind. An excellent imperial stout, among the best i've had. 1,088 charactersemerge077, May 20, 2013

Thanks for opening this with me, VaTechHopHead!
Black and thick throughout. Moderately-sized dark brown head. Oily, thick, and substantial. Shiny. Perfectly appropriate, and a very pretty stout. Moving on to the fun stuff...
Intensely rich, fresh, and bold coffee aroma. This is a high-quality, freshly-brewed smelling treat, complemented nicely by rich, earthy, and sweet maple syrup notes. Adds complexity as well as sweetness. Alcohol strength is hidden in the aroma. Sweet yet satisfying. Appropriate for breakfast.
Again, as with the aroma, fresh, bold, complex espresso coffee leads the way, coathing the mouth, complemented by strong maple notes, though the sweetness is left relatively balanced. Moderate bitterness. Lingering coffee finish.
Incredibly well crafted. Near full in body, somewhat sticky, and defintiely creamy.
Fantastic coffee stout. Exceptional creation. 899 charactersehammond1, May 19, 2013

A- Pours a deep black with a dark mocha head.
S- Just like a pancake house. Pancake batter, real maple syrup, rich coffee with a hint of cream and chocolate. Unbelievable aroma. 
T- The taste follows suite with rich coffee, hint of cream, roasted malt, chocolate, toffee, and maple syrup at the finish. 
M- One of the thickest beers I've had. The maple syrup adds some stickiness at the finish. I thought that someone had put some additional maple syrup in my glass, based on how thick and syrupy this beer was. 
O- Breakfast in a bottle. I have no idea how Toppling Goliath achieved to make a beer like this, but it downright tasty and I need more. Such little bitterness from the coffee, which is rare to find in coffee beers. A world class stout and one of the most memorable beers I've had this year. 937 charactersiadler, May 19, 2013

Appearance: I normally don't comment on the packaging but the bottle and label were just so classy, and the wax was thick, premium stuff. Dark, dark beer with a pillowy mocha 1-finger head. Thick ring of lace. 
Smell: The instant the cap was removed, a huge aroma of fresh-brewed espresso hit me. With the pour, the maple notes just came pouring out and I was also pleasantly greeted by the aroma of freshly-scored vanilla bean. The aroma here is not at all subtle
Taste: Strongly brewed premium espresso blended with the sweetest maple syrup. It's really amazing at how well the two compliment one another. Dark Chocolate and plenty of roasty notes as well. 
Mouthfeel: medium/heavy bodied, could almost drink it with a spoon. Silky smooth, chewy, yet very creamy and luscious. 
Overall: Expectations were sky high for me on this beer and it overshot those by a wide margin. If you want to really understand what a beer with premium s all about, get yourself a bottle of this. It's extremely well-crafted and one of the best beers I've ever had. It de-throned CBS for me. 1,114 characterskdmcguire10, May 18, 2013

Sexy as hell bottle, with a thick coat of metallic copper wax. As nice "glug, glug" as it pours. A nice pillowy mocha head rises and slowly dissipates. Black as night. A swirl of the glass leaves a dark trail that retreats at a crawl.
This was the most amazing smelling beer I've ever come across. Picture the best breakfast joint you've ever been to on a busy Saturday morning. The smell of fresh brewed coffee and maple syrup hitting hot pancakes permeates the air. Now bottle that idea and that is what it's like. 
The taste follows the nose almost exactly, rich coffee, lightly sweet but intense maple with nice thick stout base.
The next morning my den still smelled of a pancake house. 841 charactersdc55110, May 06, 2013

Pours a thick black with a small mocha head.
Smell is sweet chocolate, coffee, and TONS of maple. A bit of vanilla, pancake-y smell. it's like closing your eyes and smelling your pancake breakfast.
Taste seems pretty balanced initially, with the same sweet malts, coffee, maple, and chocolate coming through. But then the maple really takes over. It lasts and lasts and lasts.
Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, smooth, with light carbonation.
Wow. This beer really lived up to the hype for me. Definitely seek this out. 596 charactersrodkin, Apr 28, 2013

5/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: As always, Toppling Goliath has excellent labels for their beer. Poured into my tulip it seems thicker than other stouts and the head is minimal. When I look at the bottom of the bottle I can see what looks like thick syrupy residue left behind.
S: With the coffee cup on the label, I was a little skeptical that I would like this beer, I'm not a coffee drinker and therefore usually don't like coffee in my beer. However, this beer smells of so much maple it's unbelievable. As the beer got warmer I got more of the coffee smell but still tons and tons of maple. 
T: Excellent taste! Delicious maple without being cloying, perfect balance in my opinion. Again, a little more coffee as this one warmed up but mostly mapley chocolatey goodness. I love stouts and this is definitely in my top three right now. 
M: Phenomenal, so creamy, it made drinking the beer so much more enjoyable since it was just right. Some of the other stouts I've had leave something to be desired in the mouthfeel, but not this beer.
O: Mornin' Delight is a stellar brew, I'm so glad that I got to try this one fresh before any of the maple could fade. If you have one of these, drink it now. IMHO Mornin' Delight is better than FBS and KBS and is a notch above a well-cellared two year old BCS. I'm glad the coffee cup didn't scare me away from trying this brew. 1,346 charactersDrLaFollette, Apr 26, 2013
4.91/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've never reviewed a beer on BA before, and this seems as good a time as any to start! Received this bronze-waxed beauty last week, and it's been sitting in our fridge and enticing me every since! I will preface this by saying that I love Toppling Goliath and everything they've done so far, and I believe they are one of two or three breweries to watch in the Midwest over the next couple years. So, here goes:
Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Bruery tulip glass. Very oily looking pour that slowly slides into my glass. 
A: First off, the bottle is really baller looking. Cool label, awesome wax, it's already grabbed my attention. When I pour, it looks like most stouts, very opaque, dark chocolate color, a very small amount of khaki-colored head present, but it mostly dissipates.
S: I knew going into this that the beer had a big maple influence, and the label says it's a coffee stout. I took a few big whiffs of the glass before I consumed any of the nectar inside. And I smelled some maple (that increased as the beer warmed), more coffee, burnt grains, a little chocolate. Maple and coffee dominated the smell for me. Other people have said that it smells like a pancake house, and I most definitely concur.
T: I took a sip, then a couple more. WOW. I had high expectations for this beer, but I wasn't prepared for how great it would actually be. Waves and waves of fresh, delicious maple syrup hit my tongue. So much maple syrup, that it tastes like someone squeezed a fresh pancake out over my glass! And it's the best kind of maple syrup too, not that sugary junk you'd use at IHOP. I can only imagine it compares to CBS at its best. Beyond that delicious flavor, coffee and chocolate sneak in for a subtle balancing act. There is so much flavor in this beer, but nothing is overpowering and nothing tastes fake, which is an extraordinary feat. It's certainly a sweeter stout, but I would not call it sugary at all. As it warms, more and more maple comes out, and I shake my head in wonder. Now I see why they can only make such limited batches of this! This is the best-tasting non BA stout I've ever had, and potentially the best-tasting stout I've had, period.
M: Toppling Goliath knocks it out of the park with mouthfeel and stouts. This one has the characteristic creamy silkiness that I remembered from trying SR-71, and it really adds to the drinking experience. I feel like a lot of stouts focus so much on flavor that they lose something in the mouthfeel category, and you end up with a thin-bodied beer. Not so here -- it's everything I'd want in the stout category.
O: This beer has an insane amount of flavor, especially considering it was not barrel-aged. It is the perfect breakfast beer (or anytime beer, let's be honest), and the alcohol is well-hidden. It is also incredibly filling, which might be a small knock against it in the drinkability category. Even with help, it was hard for me to finish the bottle. I've had FBS and KBS, as well as many other coffee stouts, and this is a step above them all. I have a feeling this will be one of the most memorable beers I have all year, and I'm certainly glad I was able to try it. As a postscript, TG does not encourage you to cellar their beers. I'm happy that I took their advice. The maple really took center stage, and I think that would only fade over time (much like CBS). Fresh is best! Well done TG! 3,396 charactersshebby, Apr 25, 2013

bottle 81 out of 300. Vintage 2013.
poured into tulip glass.
Appearance: black bodied beer with a very dark brown head. Its honestly one of the darkest heads that I have seen on a beer. The head is 3 fingers tall it slowely drops down to a thin cap with a thick ring around the glass leaving spotty lacing. A gentle swirl brings back almost a full finger of head. Bonus points go to Toppling Goliath for a really classy label with the thick bronze wax. Its a really cool looking bottle. 
Smell: Deep and intense premium expresso. Huge maple that smells very sweet and even a little earthy almost like the bark of a maple tree. Lite smoke notes. I will also give the nod to a hint spicy booze that almost smells of cinnamon. The maple really dominates the nose as the beer warms up, but the expresso is still a pretty strong smelling compliment to the maple. 
Taste: This beer starts off with a nice mix of dark and rich expresso with sweet maple syrup. The expresso is just huge. It is so roasty its almost has a burnt/charred note; its really that roasty. A really unique flavor of coffee beans that Toppling Goliath used in this brew; I have never tasted a coffee beer with such a roasty flavor profile like this. The maple flavor is really massive too. Its sweet enough to balance the huge roasty profile of the coffee without being overly sweet. The beer finishes with a complex mix of tobacco, lite smoke, nutty note, expresso, and a hint of maple syrup sweetness. Really well balanced and complex brew.
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Chewy, creamy, silky, and sooo darn smooth. This beer just coats your palate with flavor. Not even a hint of booze. Carbonation is spot on perfect. I am seriously impressed. You can tell this is a really well crafted beer just by its mouthfeel. 
Overall: A few years ago, my personal whale was CBS. I finally got to try it and I absolutely loved CBS. Fast forward to today... after I have drank Mornin' Delight. I am thinking to myself: "CBS who?" "CBS what?" This beer is way better than CBS and it didnt even need maple bourbon barrels to be miles ahead just plain way better! The maple is really the shining star of this beer(or at least its my favorite part of this beer) the maple syrup really translates perfectly into this beer. It tastes exactly like maple syrup should, no artificial flavors at all. The coffee used in this beer is fantastic and unique as well. Believe the Toppling Goliath Morning Delight hype because its the real deal. This beer is absolutely fantastic. Anyone who gets to drink this nectar will completely understand. 2,667 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Apr 20, 2013

4.99/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Haven't done a review in a long time but I feel compelled after tasting this one.
The smell is unreal. Fresh press coffee/espresso with big notes on marshmallow, Maple, vanilla, brownie, fudge, cocoa. Insane.
Taste is butter,maple syrup, walnuts, caramel, espresso latte-esque, vanilla and rich rich chocolate fudge. I feel like this truly is a mornin' delight. Something to open on Christmas morning or evening and just make merry.
After finishing half of the bottle I decided I wanted to try morning delight with pappy 23 in it so I threw 2mL into about 6oz of my remaining snifter... EXCELLENT choice! Pappy and MD were meant to be together. Pappy adds a nice cedar note along with the infamous sweet wheat. Can't describe the complexity of this beer in it's fulness but wow just WOW. 790 charactersAlpar, Apr 17, 2013

4.85/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap into a tulip shaped glass:
Appearance: Very dark, with slight brown highlights at the bottom of the glass as light tried to shine through. Minimal lacing, a one-finger head that quickly dissipated.
Smell: Coffee, maple syrup, & mild vanilla tones.
Taste: Pretty much the same as the aromas, coffee, maples syrup, and vanilla. 
Mouthfeel: For the flavors going on here, I'm impressed there was no astringency. Medium-bodied. Decent carbonation for the style. Well done.
Overall: They hit it out of the park with this one. It's breakfast in a bottle. They were even talking about pouring this over pancakes at a breakfast they previously hosted. For the ABV it was really well hidden as well, no heat to speak of. I would have this as often as I could get it. 769 charactersredblacks75, Apr 22, 2012

4.5/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I had this on-tap at the Toppling Goliath tap room. It was served in a chalice tulip. Mornin' Delight was reviewed from notes.
Appearance- There was only a slight ring of sandy colored head for a cap.The body is completely black, just like your morning cup o' joe.
Smell- Oh yeah, tons of iced coffee smell in this one without being overly roasty. There are notes of vanilla and even maple syrup! It also has an oat-like character to it as well. This is going to be great!
Taste- Just absolute gobs of maple and vanilla hitting the palate right away. The iced coffee then starts coming in waves. There is also a slightly sour and tangy feel that is most like dark cherries.
The finish is really strong on maple and iced coffee filling up the mouth. Man, this is an absolute blast to drink!
Mouth feel- Yep, this is how Imperial Stouts should feel. It has great coating and is definitely chewy. The body is pretty big as well.
Overall- The coffee and maple character of this beer is excellent. I would drink this all day, but at 9%, which you cannot tell by the way, I would probably regret doing that fairly quickly.
There are really no significant flaws in this stout. If you ever make it to the TG taproom, this one HAS to be in your top two on the list of beers to try. 1,293 charactersPintofbrown, Dec 17, 2011
