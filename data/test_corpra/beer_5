One of the few double barrel stouts I have had before in which the balance of both barrels work out in unison. Sweet rum plus the complex apple brandy notes bring on a truly unique aroma I have never inhaled before. The taste follows pretty close but not fully. Getting more brandy and rum and much of the apple is lost. Spices coming thru as it warms up. Complex flavors and very rich thick mouth feel. Amazing! 449 charactersGambyt20, May 01, 2017

4.63/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 5This pours the classic Huna viscous black with a sliver of stark mahogany around the edges, and a super dark mocha, soft, uniform dense head that dies down sooner than regular Huna, but can also be rejuvenated indefinitely over the entire three hour session the two of us shared this bottle.
I'm surprised to get a sting of apple brandy right off the bat on the nose, which is rapidly followed by uber nutty, wet oak, and peanut skins. I then get all sorts of spiced rum, and hints of chili peppers. In the background runs some luscious dark chocolate and sticky cinnamon drizzle.
Decadent, chocolately cinnamon comes in big right up front on the palate, moreso than the base--wow! Some of the chilies up front almost give off a strawberry sweetness. Charred, nutty oak help develop a very deep and complex profile. A little heat in the middle can be attributed to the brandy barrel, bringing a slight burn through the nose with an exhale. As I dig into this deeper, I get brandied and cocoa dusted raisins and figs. As it warms, the chili presence increases, as well as a formidable, dark roastiness. However, the chili heat lands mostly in the finish, burning on the way down, but just a little bit, and it's gone without interfering with the flavor.
Feel is a little thinner than the base, but it still maintains that superior slick body Huna is known for, with a nice, moderate fizz, finishing semi-dry.
Is it better than regular Huna? Is it worth the effort to obtain it? At first, I wasn't sure, questioning my love for one of my favorite beers, as well as the lengths to which I went to acquire this. But, only after a short while sitting with it, it became undeniable. The answer is yes, in both respects. I rarely, if ever, rate a barrel aged beer higher than its base version, but I'll easily make an exception for this beauty. 1,841 charactersSabtos, Apr 10, 2017

Best body I have seen since Morning Delight.  Smell was very nice cinnamon was dominating smell but could get the chili's and cacao on the back end.  The taste was delightful.  Some people told me batch 1 was better I can't even imagine this being better.  It was really delicious, with all the spices and the barrels coming in at once and lasting after the sip.  The taste stays in your mouth. Very nice thick mouth feel where all the chili's, cinnamon, cacao come through. 557 charactersfireazzi, Feb 07, 2017

After having heard numerous glowing reviews about Batch 1 DBH, I was expecting whale status greatness out of this beer. Instead, what I got was a hot pepper mess with bitter notes and virtually no cinnamon or sweetness on the palate. 
I will pass on this beer in the future, even if the pours being offered are free. 433 charactersrodmanfor3, Jan 16, 2017

S: big pepper, barrel sweetness, slight chocolate.
T: still big pepper, but not quite as peppery as the nose. The barrel shines through and adds some sweetness. There are still the fudge flavors from regular huna, but more pepper and nice barrel
F: super thick and coating. The flavors linger for days...
O: great beer for sure, but I hope the pepper mellows with time as I have 3 left. 438 charactersyesterdayfaraway, Nov 24, 2016

just finished a day at disneyland, time to finish the night right, boys are 7 months today.
batch 2 poured into a hunah snifter and cigar city snifter, split with my wife. drank side by side with hunah 15
look is perfect, one thing cigar city does well is the look of there stouts, 'motor oil even in the pour. small thin head
nose is incredible, the spiced stout is there, right behind apply brandy and rum. incredible on how all the layer of elements are there.
taste improves on the nose, i get the nice spicy stout up front, after the initial attack the apple brandy waves in first followed by the rum. lingering taste of vanilla and cinnomen with some heat at the end. very well done
mouthfeel as cigar city usual hits all the marks. this follows their norm. huge and sticky, coats the mouth and makes the flavor last. carb is nice, heat is kept well in check
overall this has lived up to my expectations. i hope this beer is made 21 years from now haha. this is something i'd like to share with my boys in the future.
Doc thanks for making this one a reality 1,188 charactersKevSal, Nov 15, 2016
4.71/5  rDev 0%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Batch 2 2016. Poured from a 750ml bottle into a cigar city snifter. Opened for my 1st anniversary in Hinesburg, VT. Allowed to warm over a couple hours while drinking it; this review was done about an hour in.
Pours a motor oil, viscous inkjet black body with a one finger super dark brown head - the head on this beer is as dark as the body of some stouts I've had. This may be the thickest, most "stouty" looking beer I've ever seen! 
On the nose lots going on here but predominately barrel character on the nose -  brandy sticks out, maybe from vanilla from the rum barrels, cocoa, dark fruits, chocolate, and a tad bit of soy.
On the palate - where do I get started?! Initially it starts a bit sweet, liquid fudge followed by a rush of spices, cinnamon dominates, definitely getting peppers and a light spicyness from the peppers on the follow through. After that is sweet vanilla bourbon (brandy + rum barrels?), finished by a decadent dark chocolate roastyness that lingers on the tongue for ages.
Mouthfeel is extravagent - rich, thick, viscous, velvety. Very heavy body, low carbonation.
One of the best stouts I've tasted (well, more than just tasted, I finished the whole bottle ;)). This beer is highlighted by two attributes - it's amazingly thick body and its complex flavor profile. 1,301 charactersgcamparone, Nov 13, 2016

How do they combine all these adjuncts and barrel flavors? The cinnamon is bold. The peppers are potent. The vanilla adds sweetness and smooths everything out. The Apple brandy barrel adds fruit. Rum barrels compliment the cinnamon and spice. Mouth feel is intense. This is a dynamic beer, the standard for barrel aged adjunct stouts. 429 charactersdanh53, Oct 27, 2016

At Zwanze Day 2016, Green Bench Brewery, St Petersburg, Fla. epic bottle share. Thanks to whom ever brought it.
Just tried this after 2014 vintage Hunahpu's and fuck this is extream! I mean this Stout is so heavy and full bodied, it makes most every other Imperial stout taste like Guinness. Right off the bat it smells of Hazel Nuts big time, almost too much. Has a strong Pepper burn then a refined Hunahpu's flavor. This is a crazy good beer but will probably need a few of you to finish bottle. 553 charactersKensWorld, Oct 03, 2016

5/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Finally had on 7/3/2016. Over 2 years old and apparently hasn't fallen off at all.
Look is perfect, super thick and viscous like TG and BA Dark Lords.
Nose is chocolate fudge, barrel and plenty of cinnamon, though not overwhelming like this year's Huna. The vanilla blends in with the apple brandy and rum, which are very well blended themselves and form this wonderful scent that is hard to describe.
Taste is very much the same. Chocolate fudge, intensely smooth brandy and rum with hints of vanilla, and cinnamon that isn't aggressive, but prominent and blended well. I thought the cinnamon would have fallen off at this point but I couldn't believe how much of it was there. I just can't believe how rich this beer is. I guess the only thing that I don't get are the peppers, which may have been the only thing that has fallen off, but that's perfectly fine with me as I'd rather not have peppers in beer anyway.
Feel is perfect, as expected from the appearance.
Overall one of the best beers I've ever had, right behind KBBS and BVDL for me. Others at the share who had it fresh said it's still kicking and hasn't fallen off at all, so don't feel apprehensive about seeking one out! 1,192 characterscultclassic89, Jul 05, 2016

I gave my first bottle away a long time ago to @brian29 because I'm just that kind of guy. He told me way back then that it was just OK and said I should probably let him hold my other bottle (Then I saw on here he gave it a 4.9). He cellared it for me in his vast Montresor-like beer cellar. He invited me into the cellar, but fearing my life, I requested he retrieve the bottle himself. Once opened, I found that the barrels are a great addition to the original complex beer. Still a top-notch drink and so smooth and tasty.

S: Rum, cinnamon, and chilies
T: Mocha, habanero peppers, dark chocolate, cinnamon, and subtle vanilla notes that is abruptly met by nuanced bourbon and overt apple brandy flavors
F: Pours thick as motor oil and lingers on the palate
O: Hunahpu's Stout is exceptional as-is, but this beer takes it to the next level entirely. First the beer pours thick and the nose is outstanding. The taste truly separates this stout from the crowded pack of BA beers. DBH starts with a very typical Hunaphu's Stout heat replete with cinnamon, chilies, and high ABV, but is immediately mitigated by the smoothness of the rum barrels and complex flavor of the apple brandy barrels. Overall, like many of you reading this I've had numerous BA stouts, but the depth and complex nature of this flavor profile is untouchable. This is a special beer and one to be savored. 930 charactersFireman_RK, Apr 03, 2016

4.22/5  rDev -10.4%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25A mixture of brown and black patent malts in the appearance, somewhat murky, nothing special here, small 1/5" tan head.  Aroma was a nice sweet blend of stuff.  I wouldn't say complex, there's just a lot there, chocolate, sugar, cinnamon, rum.  
Apple brandy seems to be the most prominent taste wise, a very sweet beer, does its rarity keep people from sayin' "beetus" for this beer?  Either way, it is the best Hunahpu I've had, some of the other versions (rum, bourbon, base) were always kind of grossly overrated for me,  this one at least brings something different to the table and is actually "enjoyable".   Caramel, vanilla, cocoa and toffee notes in the mouthfeel.  They really adjunct this beer up.  Chile not really noticeable this is so sweet. 
Good beer.  A little dummied up for my tastes, I think the best part are the brandy aspects of it. 857 charactersrodbeermunch, Mar 31, 2016

A: Jet black with thick oily veins in the glass. Very minimal but dark chocolate head.
S: Sweet, with raisins, vanilla and rum coming through on the nose.
T: Apple brandy and rum come through very nicely with a slight cinnamon and pepper spice that is more subdued because of the barrels and probably age. Vanilla is slight, as well as raisins.
M: Thick as motor oil and silky.
O: This is the reason I drink beer. Paired very well with a maduro cigar to bring out some leathery notes as well. Very glad I got to enjoy this once in a lifetime beer. 642 charactersMyakkaRiver, Feb 29, 2016

Jan 2014 bottle, opened Feb 2016 in celebration of the birth of my second daughter.
A - Stunnigly dark with thick molasses legs.  Great retention and ok lace on a dark chocolate head.
S - Stellar nose.  French toast, caramel apple, sweet sticky rum, almond biscotti, wet oak, poblano peppers, touch of vanilla, and rum raisin cake.
T - Soft molasses, silky caramel, baked apples, rich chocolate ganache, cherry cordial, vanilla beans, fortified port, chewy ginger bread, and a hint of warm ancho chilies.
M - Wonderfully thick and silky smooth.
O - A fantastic beer.  Exceptional complexity, balance, and power - the hallmarks of beer at the pinnacle of this style. 687 charactersvfgccp, Feb 27, 2016

4.9/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75The sweetness to this is really nice.  It certainly had less pepper than the base, which could be lost with age or just overpowered by the excellent sweetness of the apple brandy and rum barrels.  I really enjoyed this one in a very unique way.  Probably won't ever try it again, but certainly knocked off a white whale of mine.  Not oily thich, but not too thin.  Went down very easily with minimal booziness.  Smell and taste were similar where the taste added a lot of complexities.  Caramel, dark chocolate, sweet brandy are at the forefront.  The wood in the barrel shows some nice presence too.  Very nice beer and extremely glad I sought this out aggressively. 667 charactersrabbott2, Dec 30, 2015

4.9/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5750ml bottle poured into a Portsmouth tulip
Look: Just a beautiful pour, very reminiscent of the regular version. Pitch black with a two finger head. After a few minutes, only a mocha ring is left behind.
Smell: After warming closer to room temp, you can smell this from a few feet away. Rich dark chocolate, fudge, cinammon, and a slight hint of pepper.
Taste: Incredibly complex. The dark chocolate and peppers take center stage but the vanilla and cinnamon are right behind. The barrel treatment is very subtle, but blends perfectly with the other flavors. I pick up on molasses, vanilla, slight oak and a slight sweetness from the apple brandy.
Feel: Motor oil thick, and almost chewy. No noticeable alcohol and the abv is really well hidden.
Overall: Absolutely worth the high ratings. I wish the barrel treatments were just slightly more pronounced, but that could easily be due to the age on it. It's incredible that they could use this many ingredients and not have it come across as a muddled mess, yet every one of them can be picked up on. 1,055 charactersVicirus, Dec 27, 2015

This smells oaky with vanilla, chocolate and some solvent booze blending to slightly vinous with leather and anise becoming more noticeable with earthen peppery appeal also across the back.
This tastes sweet with chocolate, caramel and vanilla fading to bitter bakers cocoa, espresso, coconut and mild vinous appeal with toasted marshmallow. The aftertaste had cinnamon bark and mild peppery warmth and earthen peppery flavors that are quite enjoyable.
This is full bodied with low carbonation. An awesome, flavorful sipper where surprisingly the barrels dont dominate but instead accent an already fantastic brew. Sadly, without reading the label, you would never guess this was "double" barrel aged and neither of the individual barrels lend enough character to be recognized by themselves. It would be awesome to see CCB actually to a real double barrel hunahpu instead of just a blend of 2 different barrels. Regardless, id drink the shit out of this if I had easy access to more. 1,143 charactersstakem, Nov 18, 2015

This is going to be a chore. The smell is very sweet. The residual sweetness imparted from the liquor barrels is really strong in the aroma. Taste is more of the same. Very sweet, but it seems to be battling with the bitterness of the cacao nibs. It's very good, but seems like the flavors are really battling for superiority and no one is winning. Mouthfeel is like drinking a milkshake. It's so thick and sorta slimy. While a really delicious and wildly impressive beer, it was rough for 2 people to finish a 750 ml. This would have been much better if it was shared between 3-4. And it may sound weird, but I wish it was really cold. 732 charactersdwagner003, Oct 11, 2015

Pitch black with basically no head. The smell is unbelievable. Like a cinnamon roll with raisins. Taste is much the same. I haven't ever tasted a beer like this before. Feels a bit thin for the ABV.

Pitch black ink pour with less than a finger of mocha colored head. Some barrel on the nose, lots of molasses, vanilla, and spices (cinnamon). Taste has so much going on... First of all it's sweet and desert like. The cinnimon comes through perfectly, even more prominent than I recall from the base beer. Vanilla, fudge, smoke, and that sweet barrel booze. Not sure where those peppers are though. Mouthfeel is spot on... thick and velvet smooth. Overall, incredibly rich, complex and satisfying. The rum/brandy imparted by the barrels is just right. Perhaps a smidge too sweet though. Worth the hype. 646 charactersd5001986, Aug 29, 2015

This is another standout beer. 396 characterstmoneyba, Aug 24, 2015

(A)- Pours pitch black with minimal tan/brown froth.
(S)- Obvious cinnamon meets loads of rich raisin, cocoa, and molasses. Very dessert-like with a decadent barrel character in the background.
(T)- One of the most interesting stout combos I have ever come across: Cinnamon meets apple brandy barrel. Subtle tobacco and cocoa with the slightest hint of the chili pepper. The mexican chocolate meets rum and apple brandy. Sexy as hell. Rich as hell.
(M)- A mellow carbonation level meets a very complex and dynamic beer. The apple brandy and rum combo is the icing on the cake with this. The base beer is already fantastic, but the added complexity and depth the duo of barrels adds is top notch. Super rich and decadent, but its so good, you keep going in for another sip.
(O)- A masterfully crafted barrel aged imperial stout. Complex, well integrated, and thankfully, not too overly rich or boozy. 939 characterssweemzander, Aug 22, 2015

Pours dark and black with a rich dark brown ephemeral head.  The nose..ahh the nose...deep, rich grains, milk chocolate, boozy rum or bourbon...intense!  The taste is full and round and also very intense with roasted grain, chocolate, molasses, boozy (bourbon or sweet rum), warming but not overpowering cinnamon and chilis at finish.  Full, silky, round and heavy on the palate.  A beautifully complex beer! 458 charactersmtomlins, Aug 07, 2015

5/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I confidently declare this is the best beer I have ever had. This is the only beer I give 5/5, thus my favorite beer. Bottle to tulip.
A. Jet black, very thick, tan-fine bubble head that slowly retreats to a similar rim. A viscous tan film layers the glass when swirled. This stuff could lubricate a combustion engine. Silky.
S. Very pronounced vanilla upfront, then waves of notes including coffee, dark chocolate, and oak soaked with apple brandy and cognac.
T. The taste is mind-blowing. Extremely complex with the notes coming through in waves. This changes as it warms, but not necessary best at a certain temperature, so it is best enjoyed at a slow pace to reveal the different notes that become apparent through the process. Some of the waves that I got: coco, vanilla, spicy peppers, brandy-soaked oak, rum-soaked oak, tobacco, and spiced rum spices. Nothing is overpowering and everything melds to perfection.
M. Way too smooth for a beer that should be slowly enjoyed. Very full body, moderate to low carbonation. Silky and creamy.
O. As previously stated, this is the best beer I have  ever had. This is a masterpiece. Barrel-aged stouts are my favorite and this takes the cake. Let's be honest, there are a ton of big-time BA stouts out there and this is at the top (IMO). CCB knows their stuff, extremely well crafted. 1,337 charactersmacher0, Jul 31, 2015

Nose wafts a bit more vanilla forward, some wood, less of the olive note.   Taste is a bit sweeter with different vanilla altered by a touch more vanilla and cinnamon over chocolate.  The spice comes back a bit stronger with hints of whiskey and wood.  Feel seems a touch less bodied.  Carbonation is a touch more present oddly, but creamy silkiness remains if a touch less. 444 charactersBugs318, Jul 31, 2015

The beer is chewy, yet slick. Up front, a combination of sweet liqueur frm the barrels. It moves onto a theme of sweet fudge, vanilla and chocolate dessert, chocolate, ice cream, brownie. There's cinnamon with a touch of pepper skin and a kick of heat in the back. The finish is sweet, yet clean.
This beer certainly elevates the base beer by adding a dimension to the base beer's chocolate notes and cleaning up the beer on the finish with the barrels. 536 charactersdar482, Apr 28, 2015

No head but super black thick syrupy beer.
Nose brings sweet syrupy malts, heavy dark choc, cocoa and chocolate char, caramel fudge, vanilla barrel, plenty of vanilla barrel, light raisin dark fruit, brandy like fruity slight booze, touch of barrel coconut, and a little cinnamon note.
Taste is semi sweet, syrupy thick malts, charred cocoa, dark choc, nice coconut, toasty vanilla barrel and mild fruity brandy, little booze warmth, caramel toffee, sweety nutty, some dark fruits faint raisin, touch of pepper heat and cinnamon, chewy fudge, etc.
Mouth thick heavy, little syrupy, decent carb, faint booze warmth.
Awesome, very very good, just missing a bit more of the pepper and cinnamon, maybe a bit more barrel but nice barrel, booze hidden well, very tasty. 832 charactersjlindros, Apr 24, 2015

The intense chocolate followed by the cinnamon and spices in pure harmony with the rum and apple brandy barrels is a tasting experience I will never forget.  Thick, smooth, legendary. 264 charactersThirsty_In_Chicago, Apr 20, 2015

4.97/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Many thanks to Kevin for the bottle.
Pours a pitch black, motor oil color, revealing a slick viscosity after swirling, with a hazelnut brown, small head, which soon disappears.
Leaves back alcoholic spider legs, mingling into the darkness of the beer.
Smells of spiced, hot, chocolate, together with a wooden, slightly fruity burn. The scorched malts blend very smoothly into the hot qualities of the beer, both chilies and alcohol. Provides a rich bakers chocolate layer, enriching the unique spiciness, by ending up being a ebenbürtiger, smooth counterpart to them. Brandy exhibits a certain apple fruitiness, which gets picked up by faint lemony tequila, gently wrapped up by cinnamon and chocolate. 
Has an outstandingly smooth mouthfeel, with a lower carbonation, giving the beer enough room to unfold its full, complex body.
Tastes of alcoholic truffels, with a fruity whiff, coated up by cinnamon and chilies. All flavors are very pronounced and well integrated into the overall taste, mainly defined by a decadent mexican chocolate foundation. The beer got a spicy chili bite to it, inviting an alcoholic, wooden flavor to the palate, while both flavors blend flawlessly into each other, providing a unique depth, backed up by ashy chocolate and cinnamon. No booziness hovers above the different, diverse flavors, due to chocolate malts, which are incredible well pronounced, building upa prominent backbone. Finishes with matured, slightly bitter hops, with all other flavors still being recognizable, especially the wooden, part floral, part fruity spirits, which provide a harsh, but pleasant dryness.
This beer is fantastic, its well balanced depth of flavor is far superior to the base beer, with both barrels enriching the flavor. Results in a never before experienced complexity in a spiced imperial stout, with cinnamon being even more present than in the regular version, accentuating the malty chocolate qualities of the beer perfectly. The double burn, due to chilies and spirits, acts as a long lasting, pleasant and well integrated peak, slowly evolving from the luscious chocolate. 2,110 charactersaleigator, Apr 07, 2015

Smells incredible, rum, cinnamon and chocolate.
Tastes is complex, the heat comes on after the chocolate and alcohol flavors.
It may be a little less chilli than before, this bottle was aged for a year.
Overall I´m really glad to have tried this, and happy to say it does live up to the hype. 332 characterssunnrider, Mar 17, 2015

3.09/5  rDev -34.4%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 3Much thanks to whoever brought this out at the Philly-Pittsburgh share!
Thick oily pour, dark black, with a small collar of head that eventually receded; greasy legs on the glass. Aroma very muted, pretty much a roasty stout. As with regular Huna, this had a very weak flavor profile. Typical stouty dark malt roast, tobacco, vegetal green pepper and pickle, anise, some sweetness. Very little pepper burn, and practically no cinnamon. The barreling didn't really contribute much, though it did improve the body a bit, which I find very thin in regular Huna. This was quite viscous and full-bodied, which I've never experienced in any of this beer's variants. 
Much like regular Hunahpu, I was not impressed by this beer. For all that goes into it, it just isn't executed well, and frankly just simply does not taste good. It was nice to try it, but I would never go out of my way to try it again. 899 charactersRifugium, Mar 16, 2015

One of the most viscous beers I've ever had. Extremely, 10W40 like thick. In a good way. Complex. Boozy yet smooth in its delivery. Sweet but not cloying. Little spice in the end.
This is s greet beer but maybe not mind blowingly so. Though I'm definitely glad to have had the opportunity to down a bottle. 506 charactersZaximus, Feb 14, 2015

Pours- A neat motor oil, coffee with dark lacing
Smelled interesting spices and apple, was very intense.
Taste- Impeccable, The apple literally binds to your palette after a rum, vanilla coffee ride. Amazingly smooth, spices with vanilla hit like an explosion and then it becomes an apple chocolate spice train.
Overall- The best beer I have tried, I beg Cigar City to re-brew this. 401 charactersJonathanC, Jan 07, 2015

5/5  rDev +6.2%Very complicated beer regarding it's recipe, aging and blending.  It's astounding how well it comes together. 
Gorgeous beer - actually pours pitch black with oil-like consistency.  Incredible aroma of sweet booze - brandy primarily.  The rich chocolate comes through, very fudgy.  Some rum coconut, and some vanilla sweetness.  The cinnamon is prominent, very slight vegetal note from the peppers.  Everything is in great balance.  When it warms great barrel aromas come out - cigar box, tobacco, char, and more of the apple brandy.
Tastes vibrant and lush - very slick and full mouthfeel, though a little thinner than reg huna and zhukov.  The flavors keep hitting - wave after wave, huge finish.  Great brandy booziness and heat.  All the aforementioned flavors from the aroma shine through on the palate with more vanilla. 
It is over-the-top in it's intensity but so well balanced.  This juice is from another planet. 925 characterstimc100, Dec 08, 2014

5/5  rDev +6.2%poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter
Appearance: Pours the darkest thing I have ever seen, this is darker than the abyss. The head lasted only a second and deflated quickly. The ring of foam is clay brown and is the most colorful head I have ever seen. World Class.
Aroma: Smells massively of dark fruit, dates and raisins, then comes vanilla and clove. Second wave is spice and chocolate wrapped fig. The wood makes a strong appearance as it warms some spice and molasses as well as more vanilla. I have never smelled a beer as complex and explosively aromatic as this. World Class again.
Taste: The flavors here are border line indescribable but ill try, dark fruit, candied raisin, clove, vanilla and milk chocolate, hints of cayenne and chili. More dark chocolate combined with dates and strong fig notes. After swallow gives a hint of candied apple and slightly tart fig with a spiced finish of chili. Another World Class.
Mouthfeel: Extremely viscous yet smooth and silky with light full carbonation. Slight tingle from the peppers.
Overall: If you know nothing about this beer educate yourself. It may be the best beer I have ever had to date. So much in fact that i'm not writing anymore and i'm going to continue drinking.

4.5/5  rDev -4.5%This was a damn good stout! Pours a dark body with a short dark golden head. Possesses an aroma that of a chocolate covered berry that stings the nostrils ever so lightly. The flavor though...well, sends a fusion of chocolate, mild spice, and slight vanilla. Very sweet chocolate overall. Highly recommended for any lover of chocolate stouts.

5/5  rDev +6.2%Glad I got to try this beast of a beer. Part of a package of beers I received for my '14 BVDL from Joromiller, thanks man!
Appearance: Dark with a tan mocha head. Can tell by the appearance how dense the beer is going to be. 
Smell: If I could make this smell into an air freshener, I would hang that shit everywhere. Cinnamon hits the nose first, followed by chocolate, spiced rum, roast, oak, vanilla, all of the smells blend together so well, getting you ready for what's inevitably going to be a fantastic beer.
Taste: Wow, I mean I knew this was going to be good, but wow. Had this side-by-side with a '14 BVDL and, while they are two completely different flavored stouts, this one was every bit as big of a beast as the DL. Same as the nose, cinnamon dominates but doesn't overpower. Chilis and chocolate blend together so well, with oak and vanilla in there. So many flavors stand out, yet blend together so perfectly. Outstanding.
Mouthfeel: A perfect consistency, not thin at all, chewy but totally drinkable. Could easily finish this 750  by myself. 
Overall: World class, about as perfect of a BA stout as you can come by. Glad I was able to try it. 1,165 charactersGameover170, Oct 21, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +0.8%Bottle shared by Darkguardian. Joan Jett black pour with a chocolate head. Mild chili and cinnamon aromas. A little thinner in the body than previous treatments I believe, but still fantastic with a beautiful oily sheen. Outstanding with big chili, pronounced cinnamon, vanilla, coconut, and dark roasted malt highlights. Mellow brandy, rum, and oak lowlights. Absolutely fabulous.

5/5  rDev +6.2%A: Motor oil.  Thick and black.  I dipped my finger in my second glass and it coated it and almost appeared to stain it.  It was viscous.
S:  Brandy, spice, chocolate, vanilla, and caramel.  
T: Wow.  All of the chocolate, and brandy, with an after taste lingering into the cinnamon and rum, then the vanilla, and finished with the heat from the peppers.  Ridiculously balanced, and the flavors excited every part of my palate.  Very sweet, and dessert like.  
M:  Thick, and silky.  Soft, and very little carbonation after the dark brown head settled in my glass.  
O:  To date, the is the best beer I have ever tried... 625 charactersJefferyLaGrow, Sep 14, 2014
5/5  rDev +6.2%Truly lucky to try this guy.
Poured into my Sam Adams taster.
Appeared a jet black color with a light brown half finger head.  Dark.
Smelled delicious - chocolate, cinnamon, slight heat, roasted malts, dark fruits.  Very complex.
Taste is absolutely insane.  So much going on here.  Cinnamon definetely present, followed by chocolate, marshmallow, vanilla, apple-pie.  Unreal.  Peppers not easily detected.
Mouthfeel is thick and chewy.
Overall this was absolutely delicious.  Very complex.  Awesome.  Perhaps my favorite stout to date.  Brilliant. 554 charactersTWStandley, Sep 14, 2014

Pitch black with a dark brown head.
Smell/taste is glorious, decadent chocolate, vanilla, sweet rum and apple brandy, light oak. Some pepper flavor, but not like fresh huna. Some dark fruits, lush pomegranate.
Feel is smooth, thick and chewy, just a hair off the best of the best.
Overall this is a banger. I'd drink your bottles soon though, this has fallen off a bit since 18 months ago. 492 charactersKevBot89, Sep 13, 2014

4/5  rDev -15.1%2014, enjoyed in a tulip. 
A: Thick pour, very viscous out of the bottle. Not a ton of effervescence. The pour finishes with a slight head lacing around the glass. Color is jet black, head more a muddy sand. 
S: Common aromas release ground cocoa, oak, fig, apple, and crushed cinnamon. 
T: Overwhelmingly Apple Brady forward. The Rum aging doesn't help as it adds a generous amount of sweetness to the brew. Thought almost all the wonderful flavors of a traditional Hunaphu were absent. 
M: Sparingly carbonated with a familiar Huna body. 
O: Thought this one was overly sweet. The Apple Brady completely dominated in our tasting. 637 characterskylelenk, Sep 12, 2014

Poured into a 5 oz. glass, so not much foaming/head, but it is a solid jet black. Pretty viscous, with a khaki colored rim.
 Smells of chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, rum, a little spice, and sweet fruit.
 Tastes like everything listed on the label. Amazing. The cinnamon really comes through, but is balanced perfectly with a little heat from the chili peppers. I usually dont care for spiced beers, but this one works well. Very subtle.  The brandy and rum are both distinguishable. Also a brownie like chocolate toned down a bit by vanilla. Nice creamy texture.  Leaves a wonderful aftertaste. 
I am giving it a perfect score based on the combining of so many ingredients that balance and compliment each other so perfectly. 773 charactersWesMantooth, Aug 29, 2014

Aroma is so complex. Cinnamon apples, vanilla, chocolate.
Flavor is mind blowing. Rum soaked brownies, iced cinnamon rolls, chocolate and coffee are there, the apple brandy really comes through as it warms. The whole beer changes with every degree. I've never had anything so complex.
Mouthfeel is chewy and thick.

4.85/5  rDev +3%A: The deepest, darkest, thickest pour I've ever seen. Beautifully dark with an almost reddish tan head. Really incredible. 
S: Best smelling beer my olfactory system has had the pleasure of experiencing. Vanilla and chocolate are prominent along with a strong smooth rum/brandy presence. Cinnamon and peppers come through slightly yet still noticeably as well. Incredible.
T: Chocolate, vanilla and Rum come through most in the initial sips with faint peppers and brandy flavoring along with a hint of cinnamon. Very well balanced with flavors coming through in waves. As the beer warms, more of the brandy started to be introduced, especially an apple presence. Peppers do kick up a little more as well but still not overtly so. Cinnamon comes through a lot more too as it warms. 
M: So thick and coating. It's one you will feel long after you have sipped it. The flavors linger on your palate and leaves a lasting impression.
O: One of the best barrel aged stouts I've had the pleasure of tasting. Best appearance and smell of any beer I've had and taste is on par. Great beer. 1,081 charactersbrowniewithnuts, Aug 18, 2014

4.77/5  rDev +1.3%Thanks to Paul for picking this up at Cigar CIty from me!  Drinking it on my 52nd birthday.  Incredibly thick, black as night pour with a one finger dark caramel-colored pour that dissipates quickly with almost no lacing.  The nose is somewhat subdued initially, but opened up as it came to temp.  Rich and boozey with huge chocolate fudge notes along with hints of cinnamon, vanilla, soy sauce, dark chocolate, tobacco, and oak.  The taste is bold, complex, and just freaking amazing!  Huge chocolate fudge brownies along with the perfect amount of cinnamon, hints of vanilla, black cherries, toasted coconut, cocoa, espresso, tobacco, and soy sauce.  As it warms, the barrel aging becomes more evident, especially the rum.  Probably the best use of peppers in any beer I've had.  Very subtle, but really adds to the finish and is never overpowering.  The mouthfeel is incredibly thick, but smooth as silk.  None of the featured ingredients are there unecessarily, and all come through in just the right amount.  Overall, definitely the best Imperial Stout I've had, and quite possibly the best beer.  Complex and flavorful without being boozey like the most of the rest in this category.  And at 11%, it's scary drinkable.  Can't recommend this enough! 1,254 charactersbeerdrifter, Aug 17, 2014

5/5  rDev +6.2%Bottle 1 of 2 from El Catador Club.
Appearance: Pours black, as expected with a quarter finger of prominently light brown head that collars quickly. You can tell this is Huna by how sluggishly it glugs into the glass. I think regular Huna/Zhukov might very well be the thickest beers I’ve ever drank, and this is certainly no exception.
Smell: Cocoa, cinnamon, coconut, vanilla, faint rum, apple brandy, dark fruit and let’s not forget a spicy pepper/heat element from the chiles. No bullshit, it’s all there. Honestly, this smells as advertised and radiates a formidable stench like that of no other beer prior.
Taste: There is so much going on here, describing this will certainly be no easy task. As it begins, cocoa, cinnamon and vanilla dance with each other leading into a subtle coconut that acts as a brief intermission before your palate is, get ready…PUNCHED IN THE FACE with apple brandy! Wow!! It’s impossible to miss! As the brandy subsides, spicy rum creeps in and is complemented perfectly by the subtle heat of the chiles. A unique adventure of a beer, if there ever was one.
Mouthfeel: Regular Huna gives BCBS a run for its money in the viscosity department and may even surpass it. However, I feel that the double barrel treatment may have unfathomably thinned this beer out a bit somehow, but it doesn't detract from anything...just makes it more drinkable, while still being plenty viscous. It’s just creamy and perfectly thick all at the same time
Overall: I’m not one to give 5s out, but if a brewery takes an epic beer that is already fairly complex and significantly improves upon it, I have no choice. This beer kicks ass, and is amazingly unique…I don’t like many rum beers, but it plays off the chiles perfectly to make it the best (at least partially) rum barrel aged beer I’ve ever had, and also one of the best beers ever. Don’t spend $200 on Rare…get this. 1,916 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Aug 16, 2014

A: Pours viscous, jet black, with a fine dark brown, espresso-like ring of head. Minimal lacing but the collar is very persistent.
S: A very light aroma which doesn't open up much until hitting near room temp. Some cinnamon and dark roast coffee, tobacco, dark fruit, and a touch of oak/vanilla. The apple spirits and spiced rum character show up as it warms, but overall the barrel aspect is minimal. 
T: Huge dark cocoa, almost fudge brownie-like, dark coffee and malt, a touch of vanilla carries through most of the sip and adds nice support, lots of delicious cinnamon, a touch of spiced rum sweetness and apple, and a touch of chile on the long finish. Mild sweetness.
M: Thick, creamy hot chocolate-like body, and light carbonation.
O: Tasty, smooths out the corners of regular Huna, and improves what is already a superb beer. Laudable complexity. But overall, I'm having a hard time reaching the conclusion that it's an exceedingly impressive beer (much less that it's worth what it trades for). You've really got to search to find the barrel treatment; I think a little heavier hand would have made an excellent beer phenomenal. 1,171 characterspmarlowe, Aug 03, 2014

A- Pours incredibly thick and viscous, midnight black, with a medium sized dark mocha head that slowly recedes leaving some lacing. Some nice alcohol legs appear when swirled.
S- The aromas don't explode from the glass, but when explored it is full of complex subtleties. Dry cocoa and bitter dark chocolate are followed by sweet vanilla. The chilies' sweetness and slight spiciness meshes amazingly well with the apple brandy. The spiced rum and cinnamon blend fantastically as well. Some fudgy chocolate and booze round it out.
T- The flavor follows the nose incredibly closely. Bitter chocolate, roast and smooth vanilla meets a counter-point of cinnamon and chilies. The rum and apple brandy barrels impart such wonderful complexities! As it warms the fudgy chocolate really comes out to counter-balance the chili heat. As in the nose the rum and cinnamon play off each other as do the chilies and apple brandy. This is extraordinarily complex and at the same time perfectly balanced!
M- Thick and viscous, drying, good carbonation, and only slightly boozy.
O- This beer just comes together so perfectly with flavors that compliment and play off each other so well! It's delicious, complex, and greater than the sum of it's parts! 1,272 charactersSadMachine, Aug 02, 2014

A: Pours an oily black with a 1/2" dark mocha head which fades slowly to the rim leaving spots of lace.
N: Dark cocoa, earthy, roast, rum and and a hint of sweet brandy.
T: Apple brandy and rum integrates very well, chilies and cocoa are also well balanced. The cinnamon is a little strong - minor issue and not a flaw.
N: Full body and light carbonation. Smooth , rich and luscious. Dark chocolate cake with peppery spice drizzled with rum and apple brandy icing.

4.71/5  rDev 0%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a bottle into a Prairie Teku glass. Bottle courtesy of solo103, and shared with Abbbp, who teamed up with me to snag this whale. 
Appearance: The beer pours a pitch black motor oil, with a tiny but persistent head the color of pennies. Not much in the way of lacing. I've never seen a darker head than this one, it's as copper as they come. Gorgeous.
Smell: Strong alcohol, but loads of apples and cinnamon, on top of chocolate and chiles. If there are hints of vanilla, they mix in with the cinnamon. Like an apple pie and then some, really.
Taste: Definitely a lot of alcohol again, which is fine because what lies beneath it is so amazing. Lots of cinnamon, the apple brandy is strong here too. Chiles contribute a vague heat but more of the actual chile flavor, which of course plays very nicely with all other components involved, such as the cacao nibs and the vanilla. The only knock I have against this is the booziness. 
Mouthfeel: Motor oil. Thick and sticky. Seals my mouth shut. A perfect amount of carbonation on this, which is to say it's relatively low. Just enough to keep the beer nice and full-bodied.
Overall: Yeah, this lived up to the hype. 1,178 charactersWTKeene, Jul 24, 2014

A- My god...the thickest of thick. Multiple people dropped their jaw at the sight of this one as it slipped into the glass. Motor oil. Glass may be permanently stained. Little to no head
S- Love the brandy and rum mix. Chocolate donuts and milk chocolate. 
T- Rich, sweet, malty goodness. Cocoa. Faint spice layered in with the rum. The rum seems to be picked up more than the brandy. Still a little bit of the teryaki notes that I got from the base beer.
M- Creamy, chewy. Oh so rich. Hefty booze, but not distracting. Maybe the best feel of any barrel aged beer i have had
O- Very complex. Intensely sweet. The base is present, but certainly takes it up a number of notches. Let it warm up and enjoy 831 charactersBosoxfan20, Jul 20, 2014

MF - Thick, creamy beer that allow this one to be nice and smooth

- Pours motor oil thick black with thin layer of ominous dark brown foam.
- Smell is a wonderful and complex mix of aromas, consisting of roasty chocolate, sweet rum, spicy peppers.
- Taste is ridiculous, bursting with flavors of rich fudge, sweet vanilla, cinnamon and other spices. The finish features heat from the peppers and some rum/brandy barrel character. Neither of the barrel components are over the top, but they are well integrated and complementary of the other flavors. I really love how the pepper heat and brandy barrel finish round out and balance the sweet vanilla fudge.
- Body is thick and coats the mouth elegantly to distribute the flavors, a perfect mouhtfeel.
- Overall the best stout I've had, period. I smiled or shook my head after every gulp. Lives up to the hype, can't imagine me being able to obtain another bottle at its current value, though.
BA Biscotti break had been my favorite stout before I tasted this beer, but DBH just brings a whole new layer of complexity. 1,041 charactersdeschutes_fan, Jun 30, 2014

The legs on this beer are amazing. Aroma is apple brandy liquer, warm spice cake, thick decadent chocolate, a touch of rum, and some barrel and pepper heat. The taste is just incredible. Smooth apple brandy, chocolate fudge, vanilla wafers, cinnamon, spice, and some pepper heat on the finish. This beer is just fucking decadent as hell. I’m drinking the whole thing to my face.

poured into Utopias snifter.
A- The color of the beer is motor oil. Almost no head. Oily lacing surrounds glass. 
S- over ripe bananas, dates, chocolate and a note of cinnamon.
T- follows the nose. The dates blend with Turkish apricots and other dark fruit. this beer is really sweet. Some peppers notes. 
M- full bodied with low-no carbonation. Thick oil that coats your palate. rich and and smooth.
O- Spectacular, unique dbl barrel stout. The regular Huna is a treat and perhaps lends to my personal preference; but this is legit. 627 charactershillvt4me, Jun 25, 2014

poured into TG snifter.
Appearance: The color of the beer is as black as black can be with 1 full finger of dark brown head that drops down to a ring around the glass. heavy booze legs and heavy glass staining is noted. 
Smell: lots of cinnamon and chocolate cake. sweet and rich rum. smells slightly boozy. dark fruit and tobacco. hint of the peppers too. complex nose! it smells great!
Taste: first thing that I taste is cinnamon rolls with a rum icing and a flourless chocolate cake very chocolately. brown sugar and tobacco notes. this beer is really sweet and rich; that umami is really prominent. earthy peppers adding a nice level of heat that melds with the slight boozy kick perfectly! hint of marshmellow fluff as well. this beer has a deep complexity and layered flavors that is very decadent. the rum and apple brandy are both present in just the right proportions so that the adjunts are tasted and nothing is missed from the barrels either.
Mouthfeel: full bodied with low carbonation. motor oil that coats your palate. rich and fairly smooth with appropriate booziness.
Overall: You can taste all the adjunts and both the barrels. this is a top tier stout from florida. its my first barrel aged huna and its was fantastic. all that said...I am not a huge fan of cinnamon, but its pretty solid in this beer. 1,387 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jun 16, 2014

Pours a black beer. No foam. Smells like coffee, vanilla. Taste is like old fortified wine, very complex. The scent of the barrels is present. A bit heady, yet goes down smooth. It will get your head spinning quick. 294 charactersJulioH, Jun 08, 2014

Chocolate booze. Apple brandy is most prominent.
Rum and apple brandy notes are blended perfectly. Cinnamon lends almost a cherry flavor as well.
For some reason I would have thought this would have been a touch thicker but even still, no complaints. Low carbonation.

A - Pours a beige foam, settles nicely with a proper lacing
S- like pure chili chocolate coffee (if such a things existed) - swirled and let it warm a little, smelled way stronger as it did
T - Perfection - chocolate up front, with a vanilla hit before the pepper starts, ends with a coffee chocolate - you always wonder what all the hype is about and then you realize one beer brings four flavors in a purposeful transition giving it a unique and signature taste
M - Smooth and velvety, burn from the pepper was subtle and left my palate intact
O- Been wanting to try this since it dropped, lived up to the hype. Even though it's rareness makes it more desirable, you wish this was a beer available at the grocery store, because I could drink it every day, nice work CCB! 838 charactersBrdlist, Jun 04, 2014

Appearance: Pours a midnight black - darkest beer I've ever seen - just like Zhukov and regular Huna. 
Smell: Smells amazing. The most dominant flavor is the cinnamon, followed by the peppers, then vanilla, then the rest. Chocolate, malts, cacao, dark fruits, no hops, no bitterness, very sweet. The barrel character comes through in the nose through the sweetness. 
Taste - The taste is absolutely fantastic. Follows the nose with more of the rum barrel and the apple brandy barrel coming through more in the flavor. Just enough pepper flavor (not overpowering) and no heat or alcohol burn/flavor whatsoever. No aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel: Thick viscous mouthfeel. 
Overall: One of the best beers I've ever had, bar none. 769 charactersGameFreac, Jun 01, 2014

The most anticipated bottle of the lot, since I am engaged in an illicit relationship with Huna the Regular (good thing I'm small). 750ML bottle that is just beautiful. Split with my wife. My suggestion that I get a bigger pour for all the work securing this gorgeous creature went over like a foul tip to the crotch. Did that last week. No fun. God bless nut protectors, while we're at it. 
But I digress, as usual. The pour is black as the north country at night, with almost as much carbonation: only a hard pour brings flecks of head. Primary smell is Huna, with the barrel coming on as an afterthought: deep roasted malts, spices/cinnamon, chiles, only then does the wood come through & finally, the barrel. Not sure I could pick out the rum or apple brandy individually, but the booze is there. Purty. 
Hunahpu's - Double Barrel should be made into a lip balm that I could lick off my lips all day. The Huna base certainly isn't hiding: the chiles have been lifting, & threaten to give me a natch of heartburn to bring to bed. Chocolate & vanilla bring more, non-chile warmth before the barrel arrives. The rum is evident as a distant additional sweetness, but the apple brandy comes on strong in the middle of the beer & dances with the chile heat on the ending. And already half gone. Already feeling the sad face. I'd give this a 6 for drinkability given the option. 
This elicits the same response as the first time I tasted Hunahpu's: wow. I'm not sure the barrels can possibly add much to an already near-perfect brew, but damn, they do try. An elite, top-shelf beer - but really, if you can't procure one, get a regular Hunahpu's & pretend it's a double-barrel, because there ain't much fall off. 1,757 charactersmaximum12, May 28, 2014

4.9/5  rDev +4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Opened and poured into a Hunahpu's snifter. I took a full pour the rest of the family took small to half pours. This was for graduation and I'm really happy Mike could make this happen for me.
A - Really thick pour that's dark as night with some browning around the edges of the glass, very small mocha head that dissipates back into the glass 
S - Smell is really rich with all kinds of chocolate with hints of chiles, cinnamon, vanilla, oak, and very little hints of dark fruits on the nose. This is one of the best smelling beer that I've had.
T - Taste follows the nose to a point. Rich dark chocolate with cinnamon. Heats starts to build on the lips and inside the mouth the more you drink but it's delayed. Really a nice touch to the beer. Starts with vanilla and brandy then switches to some chocolatey fudge taste and finishes with more cinnamon heat oak and rum. Like I said the heat lingers and it is awesome
M - Chewy almost full bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. 
O - This was one of the best beers I have had. It is my second barrel aged stout offering from CCB and this one was definitely a memorable one. I will be seeking this out again most likely. You can definitely taste the base which I found a little underwhelming, but with the new barrel character this turns out to be fantastic 1,317 charactersdrmcleod10, May 26, 2014

From a 750 into a tasting glass.
Huna aged in Apple Brandy and Rum barrels then blended back together. 
APPEARANCE: A thick, dense, black pour produces a nice, tight, dark mocha colored head after a wonderful cascading effect that looks stunning. Head retains really well and slowly fades to a good full cap. Jet black body and minimal carbonation evident. A fuller wisp and ring remain, showing some beautiful swirl patters after each sip, and leaves some falling dots of lace down the glass. Looks wonderful, just as the regular version does. 
SMELL: Chilies, cinnamon and cocoa nibs on the nose, with some nice brandy, oak, vanilla, raisins and rum as well. Light roasted and chocolate aromas as well. Very nice and plenty bold enough. Great. 
TASTE: Very flavorful and well balanced all around. Brandy, vanilla and coconut up front, with roasted flavors, some bitter chocolate, chilies and cinnamon at the swallow. Big, bold and lingering finish of brandy, oak, chilies and cinnamon, raisins, some rum, as well as some bitter dark chocolate and roasted notes. Not boozy at all. Very tasty and extremely well balanced. Lovely. 
PALATE: Medium-full body, oily, with medium carbonation. Creamy on the palate, goes down fine with a slightly oily and mouth-coating finish. Fantastic feel for the style, and just as menacing as the base beer. 
OVERALL: This was excellent. Lots of base beer and wonderfully balanced adjuncts under a blend of complimenting and delicious brandy and rum barrels. The execution of this barrel aging project is great and the base beer is world class anyways. Loved this one and would be very happy to drink some more at some point. Thanks again guys! This was great. 1,801 charactersJeffo, May 10, 2014

A- motor oil black with a brown head that dissipates quickly into an outside lace. 
S- the first thing that hits is the apple brandy. Its sweet and sticky smelling. Then the rum sits in behind it. There's a ton of cinnamon and pepper in the nose as well. Ot smells spicy sweet and chocolately.
T- the cinnamon hits first. Heavy with a hint of chocolate. Then the barrels taste like they are swirling in my mouth. Then the peppers. They are hot but with a sweet smoothness from the other ingredients. The peppers sit in the back of your mouth and keep it hot. 
M- thick and chewy. I feel like i'm chewing on a stout candy bar. Its so silky and feels amazing in my mouth. 
O- am amazing beer. So many complex flavors and smells. I wish this glass would never stop filling up. Can't wait to age one of these and see how it changes. 873 charactersmlhyatt, May 09, 2014

The aroma brings a grandiose helping of cinnamon, roast, brandy. What a flavor! Ample cinnamon at first followed by a perfect compliment of chilis. Silly smooth brandy notes with a delicate sweetness from the rum barrels. A lovely concoction. Wonderfully smooth on the palate. World class. 396 charactersHuhzubendah, May 08, 2014

Solid inky black color with a creamy dark mocha head that slowly dissipates to wisps on top. My God that aroma is heavenly! Rich chocolate caramel and molasses with a spiced rum cake kind of feel to it. Moderate amount of cinnamon, light wood and vinous fruity notes. The flavor is rich chocolate spiced cake with hints of rum and molasses. The alcohol shows a bit of warming but is never harsh. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a slick syrupy sticky mouthfeel. Damn that is a great beer! Even the non beer geeks I shared this with enjoyed it. Wish I had more! 623 charactersjohnnnniee, Apr 26, 2014

A - Jet black, opaque. minimal head
S - Booze. Strong barrel presence, but minimal rum. Light cinnamon and chiles.
T - Apple brandy is stong here, rum has faded quickly... chilis come on stong at the back end
M - Can't complain... nice and sticky
O - This was a fantastic beer... Glad I shared it with a buddy as this would be hard to finish by myself... Is it worth the hype? Eh, maybe... but I'm very happy to have tried it. 526 charactersKramerbarthomer, Apr 25, 2014

Review #550.
A- Silky motor oil pitch black body. One finger dark mocha head, very good retention, good lacing. It's got a ton of legs throughout. It's a beautiful stout period.
S- Tart green apple (presumably from the apple brandy barrels), dark chocolate cake, fudge, cinnamon and caramel glaze. This smells fantastic, and there is also a slight vegetal presence that becomes hot chili peppers as the beer gets closer to room temperature. Milk chocolate, bitter vanilla presence, everything is here in the nose.
F- Even better than it tastes. Phenomenal. Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, fudge, cocoa, cinnamon, chili pepper heat, caramel, vanilla, a touch of oak, everything. This is one of the most complex and interesting beers I've ever had. 
M- True to the Marshal Zhukov base stout, this is full bodied, silky smooth with relatively low carbonation. Thick, oily and very delicious. The backend is a potpourri of all the adjuncts that make up this beer, including the individual barrels.
O- I have to confess that going into this bottle, I thought that there is no way this beer deserved a 4.79 rAvg at the time of writing. However, to my pleased chagrin, this is one of the best beers I've ever had. And that's saying a lot given that I've had a ton of great beers in the past year. This is probably the best barrel-aged Mexican-style stout I'll ever have, although I reserve the right to change this if I ever get a full pour of Barrel-Aged Abraxas out of the bottle. As far as beers go though, this is a clean-cut winner that shouldn't take a ton of beer to obtain, at least not in comparison to how good it is.
Re-review: I opened up another bottle again last Saturday 6/21/2014, poured into a FFF/DMC snifter. Essentially, I just wanted to indicate that everything in the review of the previous pour is replicated here in the second pour- such that it's not a fluke. We opened up a BA Abraxas b2 right after the DB Huna, and I found that DB Huna offered greater complexity, though less cinnamon in comparison to BA Abraxas. The rum and apple brandy barrels are still very much present after 5 months in the bottle; plus the base Hunahpu is still very much identifiable behind the Double Barrels. It is a phenomenal, complex and thick stout that satisfies pretty much anything you'd want in a barrel-aged Mexican-style stout. The only significant differences that BA Abraxas has in comparison are: more cinnamon, and the fact that it is whiskey barrel aged rather than aged in the rum and apple brandy. I far prefer DB Huna's complexity and mouthfeel to BA Abraxas, and would recommend going for DB Huna if you only had the choice of one of the two. 2,730 charactersStevedore, Apr 24, 2014

4.9/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Maturity, power, grace. Savory, succulent, robust. These are the repetitive words that's going to be used as there are few flavor descriptors that can fully explain this transcendent ale. Its simply in a class all to its own.
The most gentle and rolling pour coats the glass like black ink. Leaving its indelible dye on the glass, a slow and simmering release of creme creeps to the surface looking much more like viscous espresso than of stout. With no meaningful retention or lace, the beer simply doesn't need it- its own imposing darkness and denseness speaks for itself.
Double Barrel Hunaphu's Imperial Stout releases a decadent aroma matrix that seduces the nose with dark chocolate, espresso, fudge, brownie batter, port wine, rum, bourbon, vanilla and caramel- speaking to only the high notes, the mere whiff brings about mouth-whetting and meat-sweats conviction.
Its taste is even more lavish as its silky and marshmallowy sweetness is laces with full bodied espresso, bittersweet chocolate, and all the fudgy, brownie, nutty and oaken richness that the nose saw so profound. Its vinous middle ground is of savory sherry, port wine, oaked merlot, spiced rum and bourbon-sweet vanilla, char and wood spice. Its long and villainous finish wraps around the mouth with a dessert-like coat that's never wavering.
Silky smooth and velvety throughout- its milkshake-like consistency gropes each and ever taste bud and slathers on its decadent richness. Even the most supple sip coats the mouth with its creamy cocoon and is slow to release- a definite sipper meant for the most profound of celebrations.
As its spicy warmth trails, notions of liqueur-laced choclate desserts come to mind yet this is an ale with utmost complexity and satisfaction sure to top every craft beer enthusiasts wish list 1,806 charactersBEERchitect, Apr 04, 2014

Appearance is just like reg huna with maybe a little red hue in the light. Smell is apple brandy all the way with a little cinnamon. Taste is amazing...reg huna with Apple brandy mellowed out by the rum (which adds a great sweetness) and close out with a pepper burn. Feel is great, thick but not overwhelming. DBH is just spectacular! Was worried about the rum barrel but it really compliments the beer and makes this the best beer I have ever had! 508 characterscardsfan, Mar 27, 2014

The aroma is the milkiest, chocolatiest scent I've ever smelled in a beer. It's so strong yet yields maple, malt and fudge brownie as well.
The flavor is the sweetest candy milk chocolate I can imagine with a true quality and expensive taste. Despite the strong milk chocolate overtone I taste caramel, mint, and brownie as well.
This drinks like a milkshake with a true creaminess and elegant thickness.
This ranks as the single greatest beer I've ever had and it ekes out King Henry, which I never thought possible. 669 charactersKYGunner, Mar 27, 2014

Smell is different, too. Mostly picking up a sweetness from the barrels. Taste is dominanted with chocolate fudge. I get some spice at the end, with a mix of cinnamon. The apple Brady barrel is what I'm tasting the most, with the other flavors backing a backseat and lingering up on me after. Starting to see the same aftertaste in the base and this, with this one being slightly more sweet. I miss the carbonation in this, but i do like the apple brandy barrels. 565 charactersMikeypnh, Mar 26, 2014
5/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Reviewing the Double Barrel Aged Hunahpu's Imperial Stout from Cigar City Brewing out of Tampa, Florida. This beer is a blend of Hunahpu's Imperial Stout aged in rum and apple brandy barrels.
Score: 100
2014 vintage bottle served in a Hunahpu's Day snifter and enjoyed on 03/25/14.
Appearance: Pours an inky black color with a half finger of espresso colored head that settles to a thick ring around the glass and island of head floating in the center. Okay head, but unreal retention. Nice oily legs, and serious browning of the glass from the swirl. 5/5
Smell: Big cinnamon and burnt sugar/molasses on the nose. Apple brandy, chocolate, mild licorice, dark fruit and vanilla too -- everything in a perfectly, syrupy balance. A kiss of leather too as it warms. 5/5
Taste: A little touch of spiciness upfront, followed by a huge cinnamon kick, chocolate, burnt sugar/molasses, dark fruit and vanilla. Such a great balance of flavor. Minimal licorice on the palate, if any. As it warms, the rum character comes through more. The apple brandy, which was somewhat prominent on the nose, is overshadowed and without much trace in the taste -- not that it matters much since this beer is delicious regardless. A kiss of tobacco comes through as it warms. Lingering milk chocolate with cinnamon. Damn delicious. The pepper liveliness picks up a touch as it warms up, but it never arises to the level of the California Brandy Aged Hunahpu's. 5/5
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, good carbonation. Just a touch pepper liveliness. Good bittersweet balance, creamy mouthfeel. 5/5
Overall: Pretty much a perfect stout. Better than Apple Brandy Aged Hunahpu's -- and that's a bold statement. So much complexity going on here, all near-perfect alignment. This bottle was much better than the first one that I consumed about a month ago.
Cost: $25 for a 750 ml bottle 1,852 charactersjegross2, Mar 26, 2014
3.47/5  rDev -26.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.75Alrighty . Here we go ! I first would like to thank the lovely Ba who was drunk off hunahpu while packing my box ! Cause he packed a double barrel instead of a regular ! Honest mistake , right ? Drinking and packing multiple boxes don't mix !!
A: the pour was sexy, silky , and a tad oily looking. Viscous ! Minimal head and lacing. Totally barrel appearance .
S: this very apple brandy forward. Kinda sweet smelling almost . Mild rum notes on the nose. Takes a minute to find. I'm getting raspberries and apples. Not the most inviting smell IMO . The vegatal chilies and spices are subtle. I detect those more than the rum notes.
T: lots of raspberry and apple going on and a cacao and spice finish. The chocolate is nice . Very Mayan-ish in taste if you will. I kinda like how dirty the chocolate tastes . The apple raspberry thing going on I find rather gross though. The chocolate is all the taste has working for it. I think I feel a tickle from chilies but I can't tell with the other cloying flavors from the barrel notes.
M: not as chewy as I expected , but decent body. Fair carbonation. The chocolate adds a graininess to it.
O: its not a bad beer but I believe its wayyy over hyped. It's no Life is Like ;) 1,222 charactersinkdemention, Mar 26, 2014

Pours a completely opaque, motor oil black with a beautiful finger and a half deep mocha head. The dark froth settles to wisps accross the surface and a thin halo that leaves only tiny specks of lace. 
Aromas of dark chocolate, sweet barrel, vanilla and spice. The chocolate smells amazing and the barrel becomes more pronounced as it warms. 
Wow, this stuff is insane! The barrels are noticeable but don't even come close to hiding the base Hunahpu. Rich fudge and cinnamon are right up front with the complementary sweetness from the rum's natural sugars and the apple brandy's fruit following right behind. There is a definate chilli heat mid palate as coffee, molasses, subtle vanilla and caramel enter the picture. I get a little alcohol heat but honestly it's all but completely masked by the layers of chocolate, spice and sweetness. Phenominal. 
Creamy, heavy feel with a pleasantly soft carbonation. The thick nectar really coats the tongue so chocolate, cinnamon and sweet liquer remain on the palate for long, enjoyable finish. 
Initially I was afraid that the barrel would overpower the base beer. No worries there at all- this was an outstanding blend that really complements Hunahpu's already outstanding complexity with the barrel sweetness. Truly world class and worth some effort to try if you can. 1,418 charactersThickNStout, Mar 19, 2014

Pitch black pour, nice creamy head. Smell of coffee...chocolate..and a good amount of apple brandy. The taste has so much going on. The heat from the regular huna is no longer present as the apple brandy has taken over....you get a good flavor of that but not as much as the AB Mexican cake. There is still a good amount of cinnamon and coffee and chocolate flavor here too. Rum barrel is not very present in the taste. Super thick body, awesome! Perfect carbonation.
Overall better than regular huna imo. Will age decent, though id still say drink this fresh. Great. 616 charactersAxnjxn, Mar 18, 2014

The nose presents a plethora of flavors starting with the pairing of apple brandy and cinnamon. This is backed up by strong notes of dark chocolate and vanilla. Amazing nose. The taste is incredibly complex with dark liquid chocolate paired with cinnamon coming first. Fruity apple notes are present along with caramel, vanilla, and oak. Mouthfeel is incredibly thick with mellow carbonation. Overall, a delicious beer. Definitely better than Cali brandy as the barrel seems to harmonize more with the base beer. 573 charactershomebrew311, Mar 17, 2014

A- Pours a thick opaque black color with a thick dark mocha brown head that has decent retention and leaves spotty lacing. Appears fairly similar to Hunahpu.
S- Chocolate fudge, milk chocolate, coffee, a bit of vanilla beans, rum, brandy, oak. Very complex, not quite as aromatic as I was hoping this to be but aroma wise was still fantastic.
T- Huge chocolate fudge notes, creamy milk chocolate, coffee, smooth vanilla beans (although slightly less then regular Hunah), subtle peppers that fit nicely, rum, brandy, oak. Incredibly flavorful, very complex with nice integration of flavors. With everything going on in this it melds very well.
M- Very creamy, extremely smooth, very light alcohol presence, extremely drinkable.
O- This was an absolutely fantastic beer that has a lot going on but melds everything extremely well creating a very flavorful yet very complex beer. The barrels balanced perfectly while still letting the base beer show through very nicely, something I think Cali Brandy didn't manage to do quite as well. This is one of the best barrel-aged stouts I've had and I wish I had more bottles. 1,208 charactersjaasen64, Mar 16, 2014

A - Pours jet black with a small film of tan head, quickly dissipating down to nothing at all, leaving no lace at all on the glass. Pretty much dead flat almost instantly.
S - Smells of milk chocolate, chili spices, vanilla beans, cinnamon, oak, spicy rum and fruity brandy warmth. Everything that should be present is there and shining brightly.
T - Starts off with a mix of cinnamon and chili spices quickly being joined by the milk chocolate, vanilla and toffee sweetness. The spicy rum and fruity brandy match perfectly with the base flavors. Finish is spicy sweet with some mild booze burn, lingering long after the finish.
M - Heavy body with moderate to low carbonation. Slick, spicy feel with a bit of heat at the end of each sip. Just needs more carbonation and it would be amazing.
O - This is a pretty incredible beer. The two barrels blend very well together and complement the base flavors amazingly well. I would still take the Apple Brandy version over this one but it is closer than any of the other variants I have had to date. 1,133 charactersorangesol, Mar 16, 2014

From 750ml bottle into a snifter. 
Typical regular Hunahpu look to it. Thick and dark (Motor oil look). Head retention is strong. Sticky lacing.
You get the same smell of a regular Hunahpu, but with the additions of Rum and Brandy. Great vanilla, chocolate and oak presence. Just WOW!
The taste of it is just incredible. I'm completely blown away. Having had the base beer numerous times and having had the opportunity to try Cali Hunahpu, and been blown away by both, I never anticipated DB Hunahpu to be so much better. Chocolate, rum, dark fruits, brandy, apple and a hint of vanilla. A tiny chile burn right at the end. The balance between the Brandy and Rum barrels worked to perfection. 
Mouthfeel was on the sweet side. Great carbonation, thick and chewy feel to it.
I had been told that Cali Hunahpu was mind blowing, but after having both Cali and DB Hunahpu, I personally think that DB Hunahpu is far superior. 
I wish I had an unlimited supply of DB Hunahpu. 1,010 charactersclosisinthehouse, Mar 06, 2014

4.94/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle all to myself because I am a selfish bastard. This one pours pitch black, thick and inky looking, with nothing but a little rim of dark brown bubbles on top until I get a bit more aggressive, then I get a nice small dark brown head on top. Beautiful. Big time sweet cocoa aroma with apple brandy and some rum in the background, a bit of cinnamon, some light chile powder, booze, and some faint vanilla (I don’t get much vanilla in the regular version anyway). Flavor is wow. Big time fudge hits you at the start, with a kick of cinnamon, vanilla, very faint chile burn on the way down. And that’s just the start. There is a nutty flavor from the apple brandy that accents the cocoa and cinnamon perfectly. The rum is subdued, which I am glad about, but adds a subtle extra sweetness and spice, similar to what I got from Forgotten Island. The medley of flavors in this come together almost as well as Founders CBS. This has a thick viscous body as expected from CCB, with low carbonation (but more than Cali Brandy). It goes down incredibly easy relative to Cali as well. The spices really offset the sweetness nicely and make this a pretty amazing offering. To be honest, I came into this expecting some disappointment after Cali Brandy. This is a completely different beer. Wow. 1,291 charactersBMMillsy, Feb 27, 2014

This beer is a bowl Cinnamon Toast Crunch & Teddy Grahams covered in vanilla drizzle, fudge, & sweet Apple Brandy sauce. Chocolate, roast, sweet brandy, vanilla, cinnamon, mild coffee, graham cracker.... Only thing I don’t get is the chili peppers, I’m guessing the barrels have swallowed them whole. I don’t mind, though, because they might interfere with the decadence of this brew. 
Thick, chewy, creamy; this is a very big beer on the palate. A dessert beer to the max, fantastic all around. 621 characterstectactoe, Feb 25, 2014

Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, cookie dough, spice, rum, apple brandy, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, vanilla, chile, and apple brandy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast and wood bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and thick mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but the aromas on this one are much better in my opinion. 722 charactersUCLABrewN84, Feb 23, 2014

Appearance - Inky black. Stains the glass. Mocha head. Thick collar,
Smell - Brandy fruitiness. Graham cracker and cinnamon. Some coconut. Chocolate. Vanilla. Some rum, but it's not that prevalent.
Taste - More rum here. Brandy sweetness. Chocolate, graham cracker. The coconut comes through also. Much more peppery. Lingers in the finish. 
Mouthfeel - Very heavy. Pretty sweet, too. Medium low carbonation and very boozy.
Overall - This is outstanding. The sweetness and booze are the only aspects I don't love. 554 charactersAlieniloquium, Feb 18, 2014

A- In CCB fashion, an insanely pitch black and motor oil thick beer fills up the pint glasses for our tasting group. A small light mocha tan head to about a finger but falls fairly quickly, not surprising considering double barrels. Small ring leaves some legs but they don't quite translate to lacing.
S- Reminds me quite a bit of the CA Brandy one but definitely some noticeable differences right away. The huge dark dried fruits are still quite prevalent from the Brandy barrel. Some Rum spice and obviously the huge base stout still rules all. Cinnamon, cocoa, roast grains, oak barrel and truffle dessert bomb.
T- Things really get quite wild here. The base, and the two barrels seem to find a crazy balance and complexity ensues. Rum comes to mind with a certain spiciness and nice oak. Super roast and decadent base beer with dark cocoa powder, milk chocolate, cinnamon and tons of burnt grains. The Brandy fruit bomb balances this all out and this really feels like biting into a super rich truffle. Last but not least is the chili peppers, they grow with time and add some spicy warmth and pepper flavor.
MF- Stupidly thick bodied with low to medium carbonation. Really fills up the palate and is super chewy. A nice warmth from both the chilis and alcohol lingers with roast bitterness and dark fruits forever.
Hot damn, I thought the CA Brandy version was great. This one seems to have more chili pepper, cinnamon and base roast with the added spicy rum. It all blends together amazingly and CCB should be proud of this brew, and good luck reproducing it. 1,682 characterscbutova, Feb 16, 2014

5/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter.
A: Pours like Motor Oil. I always splash a little of my CCB stouts on the side of the glass so that I can watch it cling on like glue. It's an amazing quality to me. It takes a very aggressive pour to develop a small head which fades to a small crown around the edge of the glass rather quickly. I didn't have any lacing on my glass but, my glass is tinted brown even after I've finished with my beer.
S: I pick up on the Rum right away. Vanilla and Spices follow almost immediately with a nice Cocoa presence. On the back end of a nice deep sniff I can pick up small hints of the Brandy but, only if I really look for it. A very complex aroma that I spent a good chunk of time admiring over the course of a glass.
T: Almost the opposite of the aroma. I find a delicious spiced apple floavor up front. Vanilla and some Chocolate notes. The Peppers make a supprising appearance, contributing a nice flavor and just a slight amount of heat. The heat seemed to make it's true nature known as this Beer warmed. After the swallow and on the breath out after I find the lingering notes of Rum and a familiar Apple flavor blending together wonderfully.
M: Going back to that Motor Oil theme. My mouth was coated from the first sip untill a while after it was gone. There's not much Carbonation to be found but, it's not expected in a beer like this. Very easy to drink if you enjoy thicker Beers.
O: I was blown away by this Beer. I have thoroughly enjoyed the complexity of this Beer. Another successful stout from CCB. As it warmed the flavor profile only continued to change and develop into a new and just as amazing brew. Kudos to CCB for this amazing beer and thanks for the evening of enjoyment.

A- Pitch black (sorry) with no lacing, no head. Typical of Huna or MZ. Faint hint of brown around the rim. This gums up the glass when tipped back and forth. 
S- I have read in an earlier review that they could not separate the rum from the apple brandy. Everyone is wired differently. I can totally separate both barrels. Glorious. Rum is forefront with the apple brandy closely following. 
T- More apple brandy than rum barrel in this one. Incredible how the nose and taste are swapped with the barrel. Rich chocolate, the vanilla is a bit muted from the barrel aging, but the barrel aging crushes it with Hunah. 
M- Thick, rich, a bit of a sting from the barrels. No carbonation, which works perfect with this thick of a ba stout. I seriously can't think of a thing to change. with the M. 
O- The only improvement is to add a shipload of vanilla bean, but other than that top 5 beer that I have ever had. I can't imagine how cellaring this will do you any good. My Pirate Bomb! (s) are headed downhill every day. Pop it open 1,113 charactersgueuzedreg, Feb 08, 2014

This brew pours a deep, brooding black liquid that displays its viscosity from the get-go. It looks beautiful, but i took a bit off the score because despite pouring quite vigorously, i could not manage to get more than a very thin, garnet head. 
The intense olfactory assault begins with rich cocoa, milk chocolate, vanilla, rum spice and touches of pepper. This is one of those beers i had a hard time getting my nose out of; simply wonderful.
I don't think i could ask anything more from this beer's rich layers of flavor. Sweetness, heat and alcohol warmth dance a well-rehearsed waltz across my palate. Milk chocolate, vanilla, chili peppers, green apples, peppers, cinnamon and oak are all accounted for and well represented. 
The mouthfeel is beyond outstanding. The low carbonation levels perfectly compliment this viscous, chewy stout. It's exactly what I've come to expect from CCB's Imperial Stouts. 
This beer is very close to perfect. Other than the straight Apple Brandy Huna, this is my favorite of all the variations. A remarkable brew. 1,135 charactersMatthewPlus, Feb 03, 2014

Smell is chocolate and caramel intertwined with holiday spiced apples. Really something to experience.
Taste is a melange of cocoa, vanilla, apples, oak, and a sweet toffee note that keeps the chilis from biting.
Mouthfeel is very thick and the carbonation is on the lower side.
By far the best Hunahpu's variant and something really special.
After having this a few times now:
The flavors are bit muddied and the bottle variation is quite drastic. It's far too young to blame cellar conditions. 1 bottle was near perfect and the other 2 and draft pours were great, but not outstanding. Still totally worth seeking out. 736 charactersGrapesofWrath, Jan 31, 2014

Reviewed from notes. Had on-tap at Cigar City tasting room this afternoon. Served in a short chalice glass.
A: Essentially jet black, with a thin tan head, no visible carbonation, and opaque. The head fades to some slivers of tan foam within a few minutes.
S: A rich booziness (I get more rum) up front, but without much alcohol burn. Vanilla, oak, spices, cacao, cinnamon, touch of chills...rich and heady as any I've smelled.
T: Rich malts, cacao, hard liquor (rum and apple brandy), vanilla, oak, cinnamon, chili peppers. Sweet, spice and oaky booze in the hang. This is amazing. The cinnamon seems to increase as it warms, and there are some sips that I get more chilis than others.
M: Even for a Cigar City stout, this is thick and viscous. Sticky mouthfeel. Low carbonation, and as much alcohol flavor as this has, and for how fresh the beer is, it doesn't drink "hot" at all - minimal alcohol burn.
O: Wow. This was absolutely amazing. Better than either of the barrel-aged Hunahpus I've had before. I like the base beer well enough, but it's never been a personal Top 10 beer. This, on the other hand, was truly wonderful. I hope the bottles are every bit as good. 1,247 charactersmacrosmatic, Jan 28, 2014

A - Deep, dense obsidian with a thick dark brown head. Looks thick and viscous, coating the sides of the glass with significant lacing and legs reminiscent of a fine wine
S - A warm, earthy aroma. Top notes of rich cacao and sweet milk chocolate. Subtle scent of roasted malts, tobacco, vanilla and cinnamon. Followed by just a hint of the chili peppers, spice and then the sweet finish aroma of being barrel aged. Unlike either the Apple Brandy or the Cali Brandy version, the smell isn't as strong of brandy (or even alcohol). The blending with the rum, makes is more difficult to place
T - Amazingly complex. A nice sweetness from the vanilla, chocolate and barrel aging mixes well with the roasted malts, the heat of the chili peppers and the cinnamon. So well balanced and complex. Each flavor is perfectly layered and complimentary. The right amounts of chocolate and heat (from the peppers), which I find to be two very difficult ingredients to incorporate and balance well. More cinnamon and vanilla then past years/variants of Hunahpu. The cinnamon and heat really develop nicely as the beer warms. The barrel aging is incredibly well done, adding some nice sweetness and complexity without overpowering the other flavors. There is no alcohol "burn" which is an amazing testament to the craftsmanship considering the barrel aging and high ABV. I enjoy and appreciate the complexity and expertise that went into this beer and immensely enjoyed drinking the beer, but couldn't imagine having a second one due to how incredibly rich it is. Definitely will have to split my bottle with a few other people when I open it. Also, slight knock on the barrel aging, it's so well blended that I feel like neither barrel's unique flavors really come out. And while I think the resulting flavor of the blend is greater than either individual barrels would be (sum is greater than the parts), I kind of just wanted a little bit more...which might be an unrealistic expectation
M - Wonderfully thick and sticky. A viscous, full body that compliments the complex taste. Coats your mouth without being chewy. The low carbonation and thickness allows it to coat your mouth and savor the developing flavors. The chili and cinnamon leaves you with a pleasant warming sensation.
O - A nearly perfect beer. A must for any stout lover, any barrel aged lover, or anyone that likes "chili" beers. Only thing stopping this from being a perfect 5.0 is that "chili" beers are not my absolute favorite. I enjoy and appreciate the complexity and expertise that went into this beer and immensely enjoyed drinking the beer, but couldn't imagine having a second one due to how incredibly rich it is. This one beer was a meal unto itself, something I savored for an incredibly long time. Definitely will have to split my bottle with a few other people when I open it. Also, slight knock on the barrel aging, it's so well blended that I feel like neither barrel's unique flavors really come out. And while I think the resulting flavor of the blend is greater than either individual barrels would be (sum is greater than the parts), I kind of just wanted a little bit more...which might be an unrealistic expectation. I might enjoy other beers more, but I can't imagine there are being many other beers that are this well made or better show a brewer's true talent and understanding of the ingredients. 3,507 charactersBartos, Jan 27, 2014
