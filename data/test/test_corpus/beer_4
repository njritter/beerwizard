4.69/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Canned on 9/2. If I didn't know it was 3 months old, I wouldn't have been able to tell. As long as this beer is refridgerated, this beer holds up well.
This one pours a very hazy and bright orange, with a fluffy one inch head, and a good amount of lacing.
Smells like orange creamsicle, mango, light grassiness- it's essentially hop juice.
Even though it's a bit old, this is still an incredible IPA. It's fluffy hop juice, essentially. I could say it tastes like orange or tangerine or mango or grapefruit or whatever, but you wouldn't really get the point, as it's just a well integrated full force citrus shotgun blast to the face. There's a little bit of grassy bitterness on the finish, with basically no malt character.
This is medium bodied, just so full and fluffy and drinkable, with a good level of carbonation.
I've always liked Tree House, but they've never wowed me as much as their neighbors to the East- Trillium. However, this is one of the best IPAs that I've ever had. 991 charactersGreesyFizeek, Dec 30, 2016

5/5  rDev +5.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Truly a work of art. This beer is a turbid/opaque orange. Sublime lacing. So tropical in the nose, lots of sweet/chocolate covered oranges on the palate with the creamsicle soft mouthfeel. There is a hop bite after the smooth sweetness up front. I think I prefer Julius to King Julius in terms of drinkability, but they are masterclass brews. Very Hazy is an echelon all on its own though. 389 charactersTrevor11, Nov 09, 2016

Ladies and gentlemen... this is THE quintessential so-called "NE IPA." Beautiful opaque orange glow. Smells like hop juice in the best sense of the term. Lots of tropical and citrus fruits. Taste is just unreal. Super "juicy," as one would expect. No perceivable bitterness. Dangerously drinkable. This is as good as it gets. 400 charactersArsMoriendiOU818, Sep 28, 2016

A: Pours a very hazy, light orange color. Orange juice-like appearance. One-inch, foamy, white head with minimal retention. Thin, white lacing throughout.
S: Strong aromas of tropical fruit, citrus, and piney hops. Pineapple, mango, melons, and peach accompanied by grapefruit, orange, and tangerine.
T: Straight juice bomb! Tropical fruit notes of pineapple and melons followed by citrus notes of grapefruit and orange. Fruitiness is well balanced with piney bitter hop character.
F: Medium bodied, juice-like, very smooth, and crisp with good carbonation.
O: Overall, this is hands down the best DIPA I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. Lives up to every bit of the hype. So juicy and fruity, but perfectly balanced with hoppy bitterness. Might move to MA just so I can drink this more often. Wow! Would love to try this one fresh from the brewery after brewing to compare. Amazing to say the least. 960 charactersBeerGuy8315, Sep 20, 2016

4.15/5  rDev -12.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Appearance- Dark/burnt golden color with an almost brown hue to it.  Pours a fizzy two finger head.
Aroma-  Citrus, orange, tangerine, and a bready malt sweetness.
Taste- Big orange/ tangerine upfront and throughout. Drinks like a pale ale with very little bitterness whatsoever. Finishes with a bread malt that adds body and cleans up the finish pretty well.
Feel- Full bodied and medium carbonation. Thick, creamy, juicy, soft, etc. 
Overall- Once again Treehouse produces a really unique ipa. This is basically a 8% pale ale and drinks like a juice smoothy.  Compared to Julius its much sweeter, less bitter, and focus more on orange/tangerine flavors exclusively rather than incorporating peach and mango flavor. That being said I'd definitely prefer Julius. Still, another great beer from TH, and there isn't another beer that comes close to matching this beer's profile. 880 charactersCTbrew32, Sep 17, 2016

Gotta say, I don't get the fawning over the haze. It's nasty looking, and I can feel the particulates in my throat when I swallow. And I've brewed a couple batches where I've added hops when the krausen started to drop to get them to isomerize (?), but mine have still cleared up way more than this. Does TH just use a huge amount of flaked barley or something? What's the point besides branding?
The aroma and flavor are pretty killer, for sure. Juice is the word. I get oranges and mangoes. This tastes more mosaic than citra for me. Anyway, just sent my other two cans away for sara appreciation, which I expect to appreciate more. Cheers! 754 charactersbennyman12, Sep 15, 2016

Out of all the beers I've had (around a thousand), from all the styles… this is a top 2-3 beer.  The only beers overall I would rate so highly would be Vanilla Bean Dark Lord and Prop '14.  But as for a non-stout beer, this is the cream of the crop.
Just a stunningly beautiful, deep orange hazy appearance.  The tropical fruity aromas just burst out of a can as soon as you open it.  Orange, mango, papaya, maybe a little pineapple… they are all there.  The taste is like a puree of of those fruits, which is just so damn easy to drink.  Super smooth, creamy mouthfeel.  There is malt there but it complements the initial, front taste so perfectly that you just get this great beer feel throughout.  I don't know what else to say except, if there is one beer I had to choose to drink for eternity, this would be it.  Just perfect. 882 characterseifster82, Sep 15, 2016

I think it's way overhyped.  Sorry.
Looks like any TH DIPA and the best part of this beer is the smell.  My god the smell.  Easily the best smelling beer ever.  Oranges and tropical fruit for days.  Super pungent and just invites everyone around the beer.  Just incredible.
Now the taste and feel.  It's a breadier Julius.  It's the only way to describe it for myself.  Not much different from regular Julius to wear I would pay up for it.
Overall this is easily in my top 10 but I would rather have Very Hazy and Very Green over it.  Great, great beer but it isn't the best DIPA TH produces.  That goes to Very Hazy ... 695 charactersBEEPOP, Sep 14, 2016

Aromas orange zest, mango and peach jump out of the glass. The flavor is jam packed with mango, orange, light citrus and very mild bitterness on the back end, with a light grainy backbone. The mouth feel is thick, lush and smooth, with mild carbonation. The only knock on this beer is that it is not noticeably better than its little brother, Julius. Of course, one of the best things about this beer is that it tastes very similar to its delicious little brother, Julius. 549 charactersschinebd, Sep 13, 2016

This was not super complex, but the bright bold and juicy orange and mango really were amazing.  I will seek this out again as it was fantastic.

Bought Sept 2nd. Drank Sept 3rd. 
Everything you'd expect from Treehouse. The smell, the look, the mouthfeel. And of course the taste. 
Treehouse style is something. Something really impressive to behold. And taken together, few other breweries can match them (Trillium is my second place).  
I found the King was slightly more brutish and less balanced than Julius proper. 
That's with a side by side tasting (one that Alter Ego wins for me by the way for palate gauging purposes).
Still a remarkable beer and one I'd line up for any day. Really this is a debate of the last few points. 621 charactersChinzon, Sep 06, 2016

Julius to me is the best beer of all time, not based on a category, but by invention. They created a new style. Sure, you have to categorize it as an IPA, but is it really? Everyone calls them a one trick pony, and of course haters are gonna hate, but they're pioneers. King Julius is perfecting something already perfect. Say I'm a Tree House fan boy, and I'll say damn right. 437 charactersTheBlueWaffle, Sep 05, 2016
5/5  rDev +5.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Canned 9/2/16. Consumed 9/4/16.
A: Pours a dark gold/orange, but sits in the glass an extremely thick, very burnt orange. It's so murky and turbid that it almost appears brown. It appears to possess the hue of Julius and the consistency of Green, making for a damn near perfect NE-style appearance in my book.
S: An absolute explosion of tropical and citrus fruits. The nose literally billows out of the glass, releasing potent aromas of overripe peach and mango. There's also tons of sweet, almost candied orange and ultraripe, dripping pineapple (almost like artificial, overly sweetened pineapple juice). While there isn't a hint of malt note to speak of, there's a substantial yeast presence, that sweet, bubblegummy "Juicy Fruit" note that is so pleasantly prevalent in Green. Here, it perfectly complements the fruit-forwardness; if you close your eyes, you could easily be fooled into thinking you're smelling a tropical fruit smoothie.
T: Waves of tropical and citrus fruits abound. BIG mango and peach up front. Sweet sweet peach, like drippy/sticky overripe brown parts of yellow peaches. Closely followed by zingy, candied orange notes, which quickly rolls into a wave of melon/papaya. It's an absolute onslaught of fruits that, by the end of the taste, leaves the mouth coated with a sticky--yet in no way syrup-y--film of fruity flavors. Behind all this is that wonderful Tree House yeast profile, a bready bubblegum note that underlies each wave of fruit and provides a 'creamsicle' backbone throughout.
M: About as thick and chewy as any beer I've had. KJ literally has the consistency fruit smoothie. It's as if you added a bunch of fruit to a blender and diluted it (just a bit). It has weight on the tongue, but for an over 8% beer, this drinks well below what it should. It's so creamy and perfectly carbonated, yet there is a medium bitterness that emerges on the finish. It's so overshadowed by the sweet tropical flavors, but it's definitely there, providing a lingering green/herbaceous quality to the aftertaste that reminds you all these fruit flavors are the product of hops.  
O: Not even sure what to say. I don't think my review did it justice, but I'm not sure any review could, to be honest. Packing a pungent aroma, a massive tropical flavor profile, and the mouthfeel of a fruit smoothie, this is pretty much DIPA perfection, in my opinion. KJ shows what's possible when you extract every bit of flavor and aroma from top-quality hops and layer that on top of a subtle sweet malt and pleasantly expressive yeast. I honestly can't think of a single way in which this could be improved, so I have no reason not to claim that it's perfect. Do what you can to try it. 2,701 charactersavas, Sep 05, 2016

L: Dark but bright orange... completely opaque. Glows a glorious orange with light shined behind it. Gorgeous pure white head leaving sticky lacing.
S: A tropical bouquet… not phony juicy juice but like a fresh, ripe peach and mango and pineapple. I’ve had peaches in Georgia that didn’t smell this good. It’s concentrated Julius as if you were snorting it and rubbing your face with it. 
T: Their twitter page does not lie… big and soft flavors… fruity and bright and dancing hops… everything is perfectly balanced. Hold it in your mouth and you can feel the extra hops all over. The big difference from Julius here is a deep and dark juicy beating to all flavors. Just an extra juiciness to everything. 
F: Like a fluffy, hoppy pillow with bright, prickly hops dancing on your tongue. You barely want to swallow...
O: If Tree House was a cult, I would worship at their stump... The moment this was announced with the line going wild was a moment to savor. I'll try not to drink this one six straight nights to make the magic last a little longer... 1,139 charactersjoezak5, Sep 05, 2016

L: orangish, with a hint of brown; so sort of a dark dirty orange color. Totally opaque, light frothy head. When I poured it, it seemed to kind of "glob" out of the can, thick like orange juice.
S: could smell it as soon as I opened the can. Pouring it agitated the aromas more. Smelled like mangos, cream, with a herbal quality.
T: typical Tree House Brewing citra/galaxy hops: Very fruit forward, mangos, orange, pink grapefruit, with a hint of spice on the back end of the flavor profile. A slight bite of a spice I can't name, maybe cardamom? It's more balanced than Julius, I like it better than Julius, but it's not my favorite from TH. I didn't think it met the hype. I've certainly had better beers and can't believe this is currently number 8 on the top 250. I suspect it got that number from people who drove hours to get this beer and therefore have less objectivity.
F: smooth and creamy, like really soft soft serve ice cream. It coats your mouth and lingers.
O: this beer does what TH wants it to do: be a full bodied, full flavored, slap to the face... not an aggressive slap. More like a love slap. Maybe more like a solid, wet, kiss on the cheek from a summer crush. You know it's there and won't forget it, but the sensation fades over time. 1,321 charactersGeeL, Sep 04, 2016

5/5  rDev +5.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours ultra hazy, orange in color, with 1/3 inch head.  Taste is deep peaches, orange juice, dragon fruit, light melon, and soft doughy bread.  Heavy and full bodied with moderate carbonation. Like Julius but softer and with way more body. This has the best feel of any beer I have had period.   Sweet with a touch of bitterness.  Immaculate.  Well worth the drive and a treat to drink.  This and Very Hazy are two of the best beers I have had period. 451 characterstigg924, Sep 03, 2016

Poured from a 16 oz can into a teku glass.
Pours a completely turbid, deep orange color with a 2-finger creamy off-white head. The head settles into a nice, foamy ring around the top of the glass. Leaves some cobweb lacing along the way.
The first thing I notice about the aroma is how utterly ridiculous it is. It's like a fruit truck crashed through the mall and straight into the Orange Julius. This smells more like orange than an actual orange. Throw in wave after wave of mangoes and grapefruits and you're just about where this beer is on the aroma scale. 
The flavor, while amazing, didn't quite hit the mark I was expecting. There's a ton of orange and grapefruit, fresh mango, and overripe melon. But that's pretty much it. It's as if they took Julius, turned the aromas and flavors up to 11, but forgot some of the finesse that goes into making such a great beer. It's juicy as hell, it's hoppy as hell, but it doesn't quite have the punch or balance I was expecting it to. Still, it's incredibly tasty.
The feel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Fluffy, creamy, and soft as a pillow. 
Overall, an absolutely incredible DIPA that juuuust falls short of the monstrous expectations it brings. It's incredibly juicy and drinkable and I'm very happy to have tried it. But for the effort and price, I'll stick with regular Dr. J for now. 1,379 charactersScaryEd, Sep 03, 2016

Was standing in line a few Friday's ago in Monson when they announced that KJ available in cans -- needless to say, very excited.  From the brewery to my iced cooler to a tulip 90 minutes later -- fully expecting to rant and rave. I am an unapologetic Tree House fan boy and normally find that their big name IPAs/DIPAs live up the hype -- until now.  Don't get me wrong, this is a delicious beer, but best DIPA? #5 overall?  Maybe in #5 among TH beers, but otherwise, I have to think the hype and rarity is driving more than the palate.  Drinking my second can a couple of weeks later before writing the review -- wanted to give this one a second go.
Color is the usual gorgeous dark orange unfiltered TH fare; nose also similar to TH staples -- orange, mango, tropical fruits - but I don't find this one as dominant in this category as say Haze or Very Hazy. Taste is delicious, but find it to be a little straight grapefruit with hints of orange, lacking some of the other TH  tropical complexity. There is also a little booziness that announces its DIPA pedigree and takes something away for me. Mouth feel, as with most TH beers is that super smoothness that continues to keep the Monson boys at the top of the heap -- even as many others are trying to currently replicate.  Overall, this is still a top notch DIPA -- but when you think you are going to get the King -- you expect top of the heap. This is very good and I fully expected to be putting this on par with King Jjjuliusss and Very Hazy -- just didn't quite get there for me. That being said, it was still a privilege to get a few. 1,715 characters11-52_4hops, Sep 03, 2016

Honestly though, I would take Julius over this in a blind taste test.  King J is a special treat, for sure, but the extra everything pushes this into the category of over the top.  Very Green and Very Hazy do a much better job at pushing the limits while adding something special to the base beers.  King J has the hype for sure, I mean, come on, you take perhaps the best IPA in the world, Julius, and put "King" in front of it?  Craziness on all fronts.  Still, and exceptional Treehouse offering, surprise surprise. 575 charactersctbeerguy86, Jun 04, 2016

5/5  rDev +5.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is one of only maybe 4-5 beers I've had that I would give an absolute perfect score. I was very lucky to have this as my very first Treehouse Beer when I wandered to Monson MA one fateful day to see what the brewery was all about, and it happened to be a King Julius release.
Look: Incredible. Unlike Julius which has a one dimensional orange color throughout, KJ has shades of bright glowing orange that deepen towards the middle of the body. This thing is so juicy and tropical looking, it wouldn't seem out of place inside of a coconut with a little umbrella in it and a curly straw.
Aromas: Smells like fruit juice. Orange, mango, peach, just a melange of smooth tropical fruit. While there is a lot on the nose of Julius, KJ really smacks you in the face.
Taste: Think of a tropical fruit smoothie with carbonation. Seriously. This doesn't taste like beer. This is by far, hands down, the juiciest beer I've ever had. Follows the nose to a T.
Feel: Julius is the 101 guide to perfect mouthfeel. One might think that KJ might not live up to the velvety mouthfeel of the medium bodied Julius, but the full bodied DIPA that is KJ somehow manages to keep the exact same perfectly smooth mouthfeel Julius has, despite how much bigger and more full bodied it is. Very impressive.
Overall: Like I said before, this beer is perfect (and I don't say that lightly). It's almost a shame I had KJ before I had Julius, because Julius will forever live in this beers shadow in my mind. 1,486 charactersJTStarkbeer, May 22, 2016

Tastes like a citrus fruit bomb. Almost no hop character.  The fruit lingers longer than any other IPA I've had.
Creamy, smooth and fuzzy. 
Simply the best IPA I've ever had.  It takes Julius to another level. First time I had it I was blown away. I've had it more than 4 times, and every time, I'm reminded by how good it is. 415 charactersjuliuscaesar2701, Feb 22, 2016

I will admit my first few sips didn't wow me as much as I expected them to, but as I got further into it the orange juice started to flow more and more across my taste buds. I won't say it blew me away as much as the standard Julius did last year, if only because I knew what I was getting myself into this time.  But that doesn't mean that this isn't a world class DIPA that is worth tracking down.  King Julius might be bit overrated (given how it skyrocketed into the top 10, that's almost impossible not to say), but it's definitely worthy of Tree House's top 3 IPAs. 682 charactersLochnessmonster, Feb 17, 2016

A- Pale body with an orange tinge and a massive cloud of residual hop particles clouding the glass heavily. Milky even. A fairly thick white creamy cap ascends to over a finger in my tulip with good retention. Lacing stays around with whispy webs.
S- Hops are beyond intense and pungent with orange juice and tropical fruit juice competing for dominance while they both lead into dank herbs, floral and stone fruit notes. Hops o plenty with a spiffy clean yeast ferment and pale cracked grain hints.
T- The fresh squeezed orange juice is strong with this one as it reminds me of the glorious aftertaste of OJ, the citrus is compounded with a semi bitter ruby red grapefruit flesh and juicy feel. Tropical fruit nectar is also very strong here with mango, peach and some passionfruit playing with intense dank weed. Beyond the barrage of fruits is floral, herbal, slight pine, pale cereal grain and the slightest sweetness.
MF- Medium bodied with a semi chewy creaminess and certain frothy texture. Carbonation rains down on the palate at a high level promoting supreme hop pungency. Moderately clean bitter ending.
What more can I say? Tree House is the boss of the hops. This isn't my personal favorite of the TH IPAs but it once again shows they know what they are doing and can get a certain flavor profile with intense hop bills. 1,404 characterscbutova, Feb 13, 2016

S: Much better. Like a Costco frozen tropical fruit medley smoothie. Orange pulp, light pineapple and guava, maybe even a little bit of strawberry and some powdery malt in the background.
T: To be totally honest, this doesn't live up to the hype for me. Way more malt forward than I was expecting and the heaviness of the malt takes away from everything under it. Some honey and orange in here, along with maybe a little bit of pineapple. The smoothness is pretty remarkable in this and there's not much in the way of bitterness, just a kiss of pine resin and lingering orange pulp on the finish. A very tasty beer, but I wouldn't say it's head and shoulders above the rest of Tree House's other IPAs. 867 charactersnotchucknorris, Feb 12, 2016

Both seemed to have a little better nose and brighter tropical flavors. Still, this is really great. 329 charactersjjdc, Feb 08, 2016

Appearance: golden-orange and quite hazy, though no sediment is visible. Huge, lingering white head that leaves tons of sticky lace rings as the brew is drunk. 
Aroma: ridiculously pungent hop aroma, tons of tropical fruit, citrus, etc. No malt whatsoever evident. Smells incredibly refreshing and crisp. Individual fruit flavors that I can pick out amongst the hops are peach, orange, and maybe some mango.
Taste: following the smell, it's an incredibly fresh and potent punch of hops. Saturates the palate with tropical smoothie type flavors, with peach, orange, and pineapple present. Not much in the way of bitterness; perhaps a little dankness on the finish. OVerall, though, it's pretty much a straight-up juice bomb.
Feel: thick, with a medium body, and medium carbonation. Leaves a lingering stickiness on the palate that begs for another sip.
Overall: I only got a couple cans of this brew, but they were worth the long drive and wait. I do not know how Tree House gets so much flavor out of hops, but I will happily savor the results. 1,111 charactersTheElectricOne, Feb 06, 2016

Served in a snifter
Totally opaque, dull orangey-amber appearance. One of the cloudiest beers I have ever seen. The liquid was topped by a creamy, frothy, finger tall, eggshell colored crown that quickly dropped to a barely there film. A bubbly collar encircled the liquid. After every sip, a thin wall of lacing coated the glass, but it quickly broke apart into small droplets.
The aroma was super hoppy and very citrusy. Orange notes dominated. Uber juicy and sweet. Tangerine came through as well. Tropical fruits were also quite noticeable. Loads of mango. Good amount of peach. Really fruity and bright.
The flavor profile featured more of the same. It was super hoppy and very citrus forward. Loads of juicy orange and tangerine notes. Slightly sweet. Orange sherbet came to mind. Intense peach and apricot notes. Some overripe mango as well. The beer finished with notes of candied orange peel and just a hint of rind-like pith. At 8.2% ABV, this drank amazingly well.
The mouthfeel was uber frothy and smooth. Medium bodied for the style. Fluffy and supple on the palate. Pillowy soft. The beer contained a fine, zippy effervescence.
King Julius is an incredibly juicy and flavorful double IPA, but perhaps it was a bit more one dimensional than I had hoped. While the beer displayed some amazing bright and intense citrus notes, it could have been more complex. 1,460 charactersDamian, Feb 06, 2016

I'd be happy if this was the only brew I could drink for the rest of my life. Wow.

In the glass this smells like a giant glass of orange juice with every delicious juicy fruit mixed in. Just an amazing smell. This beer tastes like it smells, a wonderful juicy bomb of citrus and hoppiness. Minimal bitterness and a well balanced profile make the 8% alcohol in this beer dangerously hard to find. This is truly one of the best IPAs I have ever had. In my mind tied with King Sue and DDH Fort Point Pale Ale. Well worth what it takes to get this beer. 580 charactersmayxday, Feb 05, 2016

5/5  rDev +5.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5bought from brewery 1/30/16 and drank next day
poured into a tulip glass.  the amazing experience began with the visual...creamy slight head, beautiful orange hue with a creaminess to the body.  then the aroma..brought me back to a fresh fruit buffet in hawaii, mango, papaya, pineapple ..maybe lime?? beautiful tropical bouquet yet it cant hide the danky hops within. from the minute it hits the mouth, its creaminess is welcoming, the fruits make their mark and you get maybe the best finish ever with the hops taking over in a complimentary fashion with zero bitterness.   it all blends into the damn finest beer Ive ever had. Well worth the 45 minute wait, i just wish the limit was more than two 16oz cans. i should note that the KJ was sandwiched in between a Maine Dinner and a Heady.  While the Dinner is amazing in its own right, the King was just a tad more special.  So good that the Heady Topper i drank afterwards tasted dare i say...ordinary in comparison. 971 charactersButznutz, Feb 04, 2016

5/5  rDev +5.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is the best IPA / Double IPA I have ever had.  It is somehow juicier than Julius and no boozy taste.  It smells great and is absolutely delicious.  I did a blind taste test with Julius, In Perptuity, and Alter Ego and this easily was the best out of the four beers.  Hope to come across this one more often, hopefully Treehouse makes this one a regular. 358 charactersfireazzi, Feb 01, 2016
4.75/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5I've been looking forward to this one forever. 750ml growler into a Grrrz teku. Shared with schen9303. 
The beer looks identical to Julius. Same pulpy color, same fluffy white head, same great lace. Smells the same too. Big, juicy, bright citrus and tropical fruit notes make it seem like I'm about to bite into a tropical fruit smoothie with lots of citrus. At first taste, I can't really tell the difference between this and Julius. However, I open a can of the latter for a side-by-side and this one is sweeter and juicier. The hop profile is less forward but its stuffed with tropical and citrus fruit. I don't know if a beer could be juicier. If you like that type of IPA, there is no better tasting beer in the world.
The feel is just spot on. Soft, drinkable yet full bodied and the ABV is hidden so well, this is just as easy drinking as the single IPA form. 
I hope Treehouse starts turn out more of this as its too good to just be a once-in-a-while brew. The best IIPA I've had to date, this will make you start saying "Heady who"? and "Hill Farmstead what"? 1,071 charactersSpeedwayJim, Feb 01, 2016

Elite lacing. To steal my friend's description of the smell, it smells like the brewery. Well vice versa. Hint of malt with saturated hops with a fruit juiciness. A good bitterness element. Juice flavor shines. Anything and everything in that orange and grapefruit family. Like Charles Barkley gave them his Orange Bowl "oranges". Feels like carbonated juice. Like a shake/float but without anything that would be gross in an ipa. King indeed. 563 charactersHootie159, Jan 30, 2016

Pours an orange-juice like super cloudy body with a big, frothy off-white head that sticks around for a while, eventually reducing to a layer of foam, leaving dotty lacing. Really nice head. 
Aromas have that typical Treehouse over-ripe fruit, super citrusy, tropical character, fresh hops straight out of the bag, grapefruit, tangerine.
On the tongue it's a tad sweet upfront with lots of citrus / clementine, orange creamsicle, grapefruit, pineapple, and very little if any bitterness. A straight tropical fruit bomb. 
Mouthfeel is creamy but there is zero indication of alcohol which is crazy considering this is 8.2%. A little low on the carbonation, I prefer a little more. 
Just as great as I had expected. Honestly a little smoother than Julius. 847 charactersgcamparone, Jan 30, 2016

S: Also pretty standard, tropical fruit forward, with citrus.  What sets this one apart for me at least is a mintiness hidden in there.  Also get a sweet honey smell as well
T: Weird to me.  Has the typical tropical fruit, mango thing going on.  But at the end is this bite, not so much bitter as it is spicy and minty.  IDK if its just me but I find it really intriguing.  
F: Smooth as a beer possibly could be.  Frothy, silky and full mouthfeel.  My kind of beer.
O: I really don't like giving out 5's.  I feel like there is always room for improvement, but quite frankly this beer did it for me.  Not my first Treehouse beer but there's just something about this one. 791 charactersedward_boumil, Jan 30, 2016

5/5  rDev +5.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours an entirely clouded pineapple juice colored beer, with a one finger broad, bubbly head.
Smells of ripe oranges, peach pulp, mango and white lemon zest among a sherbet sweetness, resulting entirely from the hops. A kiwi supported dankness compliments the lemon, adding a citraic freshness to the nose. As simple as it is, there are no malts being recognizable on the nose. The fruits develop a fantastic depth by themselves, creating a luscious fruit richness, tied together by crisp lemon.
While the beer drinks very refreshing, due to its juicy hop profile, no carbonation bubbles touch the tongue at all, as a pillowy softness provides a world class silkness from the kickoff till the end. It coates the tongue, while the beers body easily provides enough depth to maintain the taste interesting.
Builds up a nice aqueous smoothness, instantly referring to the wonderfully silk mouthfeel, on which juicy orange, mango and papaya become noteable. Once crisp lime massages the palate, the fruitiness turns riper and more pungent, while getting balanced by gentle toffee malts. Those malts then get swallowed by slightly dank, slightly resinous qualities, adding to the lime's richness. Finishes slightly dry, still outstandingly fruity, with prickly kiwi now adding to the sweeter exotic fruits, creating a wonderful fruit bouquet among its initial, creamy softness.
Not only does it drink beautifully, it also tastes that way. Do yourself the favor of letting this sit and warm up for at least 30 minutes and this unfolds a never imagined plethora of aromas, getting mirrored in its taste. Truly complex, while masterfully executed, this is a dream of an iipa come true. The fruit sorbet quality you get in Tree House's Green is recognizable in this as well, although in an alternated way, depicting a mix of ripe mango, mixed into a smoothie with papaya, orange and lemon pulp. Incredibly rich on the tongue, and than there is that phenomenal mouthfeel as well...
This is perfect. 1,993 charactersaleigator, Jan 15, 2016

Aroma might be the best I've ever experienced from an IPA. Oranges, grapefruits, pineapples, papayas, and mangoes explode from the glass. The aroma is pungent. This fruit explosion doesn't follow through on the taste for me. There is a sweetness from the malt and the larger mouth feel makes it a little sticky, sappy, and resinous. This is nice, but it took away from the fruit somewhat. Fantastic beer. My criticism is only based on the expectation of 5.0. Definitely trade for this. 582 charactersdanh53, Jan 13, 2016

Had a good amount of carbonation with decent amount of head. The smell was amazing! Aromas of citrus, orange, tropical fruit, and small amount of funk. The taste, well... yeah... this one was delicious! One of the fruitiest offerings from TH outside of Juice Machine and a few others. The beer is extremely smooth, creamy and juicy with a nice hop finish to it. This if by far one of my favorite DIPAs to date! Definitely try to get your hands on a can (or more) if possible!

4.52/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - Hazy. Almost opaque like orange juice. Thin head that dissipates quickly.
Smell - Tons of citrus. It completely overpowered my Szechuan. Very sweet smelling. 
Taste - Not very well balanced. Too sweet for my palate. Absolute fruit bomb in a good way, and maybe a sweet fruit bomb is the point. However, I was looking for something a little different. Could not tell this was 8.3%.
Feel - Oddly thin. Great for the palate, but mismatched with the beer itself.
Overall - Hmm... I am both excited but confused by this beer. Smell, taste and feel all add up to a beer that is just a bit out of balance. I can't tell if it's by design or if it's a happy accident. That said, it's an outstanding use of the citra hop.
My only complaint is that this beer gave me a pretty good stomach ache after I drank it. I was still happy for it though! 851 charactersApatschinn, Dec 31, 2015

A - pours like juice.  Hazy, orange juice in a glass.  Solid finger of bright white head.  Completely opaque.  
N - insanely aromatic.  Maybe the most pungent beer I've ever smelled.  Its a fruit explosion.  Oranges, mangoes, peaches, pineapple.  If you were blindfolded you'd never guess this was beer.  Julius cranked up to 1000.
T - insane, dumb, and stupid were the first words that came to mind.  Its orange, mango, pineapple juice.  Its not beer.  Its every tropical fruit you can imagine thrown in a blender.  
O - might be TH's best beer they make.  One of the best DIPAs I've ever had. 656 charactersjow_42, Dec 30, 2015

A: bright orange, cloudy/murky. Decent amount of white to light yellow head with a fair amount of sticky lacing. Head disapated quickly, much quicker than Julius. If you like Tang hen you will like the appearance of this.
S: by far the strong suit of this beer, multiple citrusy elements, mango, pineapple, grapefruit.
T: a let down, th citrus elements quickly vanish and leave a slight piney residue which is not evident on the nose. It actually new up tasting more like Julius in waiting. Not sure what happened but Julius tastes better.
M: actually a bit thin for the style.
O: would not try too hard to trade for this unless your a ticker. Glad a friend offered to share and I didn't give up the farm. While a very good beer, there are plenty more DIPA's far more accessible and just as good and many much better. 853 charactersDocrock, Dec 28, 2015

5/5  rDev +5.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Look - The resemblance between this and straight orange juice is insane. The ideal look in my opinion. 
Smell - Oranges, mangos, and pineapples galore! Herbaceous notes under all the tropicalness. One of the best noses on a beer hands down. Unbelievable. 
Taste - Follows the nose. So damn juicy! Tons of tropical juices up front w/ an herbaceous finish. Regular Julius on steroids if you can imagine that!
Feel - Succulent creamy mouthfeel. Soft bitterness that falls off the palate. No hint of the 8.2% at all! 
Overall - Treehouse's best DIPA......possibility the best DIPA in the world. 591 charactersTonyjenlasc, Dec 17, 2015

I docked the appearance since the head disappeared pretty quickly and left minimal lacing, but I love the cloudiness. First smell is a tidal wave of peaches, then other tropical fruits. Taste is more orange up front and dries out smooth on the back end. This beer could not be much better. 338 charactersryanflc, Dec 16, 2015

Here's the thing it's not the first 5 that I've given out, and no doubt because Julius is perfect to me, I simply had to grade this the same- and normally when we compare beers that are a 97 vs a 98 there's just subtle nuances that distinguish them. This is the same only Julius is a 100, this is a 103- soft, citrus explosion w tremendous mouth feel and hop profile... seek w confidence, I suspect it'll be out more soon, but if you gotta friend, hit him up! 614 charactersAbbbp, Dec 14, 2015
5/5  rDev +5.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The appearance of this beautiful! Turbid, but cautious as not to appear "murky". Bright apricot/orange hue, just like the TH in the label. Stunner. #Hazefordaze
This is a beer I could smell for days. Tons of fresh squeezed pulpy OJ, mango and pineapple puree. Each sniff was even more complex, notes of guava, passion fruit, fruit stripe gum. Just an absolute explosion of tropical fruit juice, the best I've ever had for the style.
As far as the taste goes, this I tell you is even more complex. Served in a TG Teku 55F, this beer jumps out of the glass and into your mouth. Creamy, velvety with medium bitterness, this is truly like drinking a tropical smoothie. Takes the flavors of Julius into Green territory of tropical notes, has a nice soft OJ finish. Just a #gusher
Feel: Well, I already stated what dem feelz are like. Creamy, velvety, and pleasantly bitter. 
Overall: The best of the best. Believe the hype. Best Double IPA I've ever had. #Hunnits 962 charactersBlackboardbrewing, Dec 14, 2015

The aroma offers orange creamsicle, mango sorbet, pineapple, tons of sweet peach, passionfruit, bubble gum, dominated by hops.
The beer follows with tons of orange Starburst, Gobstoppers, mango smoothie, pineapple puree, onto a big smack of grassy and rich herbaceous green quality with a medium bitterness. The mouthfeel is chewy and soft. The intensity of tropical fruits is almost unmatched. This pushes Julius to another level that Green offers. A combination with even more as it a bigger beer. 591 charactersdar482, Dec 14, 2015

Smell is tropical fruits.  Mango, orange.  Some sweetness.  Tastes tropical as well, with more emphasis on the orange flavor.  Light sugary sweetness up front.  Dries out and becomes a touch bitter in the finish.  Medium body.  Exactly as described.  A bigger version of Julius.  Drank a Julius before drinking this for science.  It would be impossible to ramp up the hop flavor by the same order of magnitude that the sugars are amplified.  By that metric, I think I would take Julius over this. 618 charactersAlieniloquium, Dec 13, 2015

4.74/5  rDev 0%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Can. Poured super hazy orange. I had this side-by-side to regular Julius. I was impressed by how the similarities still stood tall between the two beers. Very citrusy and fruity and rindy. There were also some big contrasts. King Julius was clearly more pungent and concentrated; losing some of Julius' nuances. Still, by the nose, I should enjoy this beer similarly (Julius is one of my favorites). The flavor was huge on tropical fruit and citrus medley. Some dank character. Tangerine, melon, clementine, citrus pith. A powerful mollywhop of flavor. The body was creamy. Pretty sturdy bitterness but not an IBU baron. I really enjoyed this one; I mean Tree House does no wrong. However, I think if this beer had a moniker not directly related to their flagship, this one would not be held in quite the same regard. Pretty amazing but I'll take regular Julius any day. 870 charactersVelvetExtract, Dec 12, 2015

Drank them back-to-back and they are almost entirely similar.  The one-off differences are probably the smoothness of this beer and it's slightly sweeter.  Presumably due to the higher ABV and dry hopping?  Regardless King Julius is a top-notch IPA through and through.  My only (small) critique is that there really isn't much in this beer that's different from Julius.  Maybe that's a good thing, but it makes it a little less special since Julius is so readily available at the brewery these days.  Still... a must-try for any and all Tree House fans and IPA fans. 656 charactersanteatr23, Dec 08, 2015

Smell-orange, citrus.  
Mouthfeel -  smooth as silk

5/5  rDev +5.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a can into #ProperGlassware
L: Pours a glowing yellowy orange that reminds me of an extremely pulpy orange juice. This beer literally looks like it's glowing. It's almost reminiscent of a tequila sunrise because the bottom is such a deep orange and the top has a yellow hue. Seeing that appearance is so important to taste, my eyes tell me that I will like this beer very much.
S: As I shove my nose into the glass I am dominated with citrusy goodness. I didn't need to even be close to my glass to catch the huge notes of orange and mango. There's a bit of papaya and I even catch a faint scent of wheat. This smells outstanding. I could literally sniff this beer all day.
T: Gigantic notes of said orange, mango and papaya destroy my palate. There's a nice malt presence, but we all know that the hops are the stars of this show. There's a moderate level of bitterness which reminds me that this is not a glass of tropical fruit juice. It's probably better this way. 
F: I guess this beer is 8.2%. Couldn't tell from how easy this goes down. Super smooth, but the word fluffy also comes to mind. There's a medium mouthfeel and it's a bit dry on the backend. The dryness could be a detriment, but ultimately it's purpose is to get me to yearn for another sip.
Overall: This is definitively one of the best beers that I've ever had. Easily top 5 IPA/DIPAs that I've experienced in my life. The appearance is awesome, the smell is awesome, the taste is awesome, the mouthfeel is awesome. I'll admit that I'm a Julius fanboy, but this beer is better than Julius. This is definitely on the level of Heady Topper, Double Sunshine, and HF Double Citra. This deserves every 5 that it gets. I'm glad that I am experiencing this and I wholeheartedly hope that Tree House decides to put this beer in a semi-regular rotation. 1,832 charactersRichD, Dec 06, 2015

I know TH beers are intended to be had super fresh, but I tend to like the cans with a little time on them to allow the contents to acclimate to its environment - for this beer the anticipation was too great.
Look - Hazy-Orange as expected.  Clearly carbonated with a big fluffy white head. 
Smell - Heaven. Orange citrus, tropical fruit, and a slight heavenly funk. The aromas brought an instant smile to my face.  That classic Julius smell that fills the brewery when it's on for the week.
Taste - Wow! Just like the smell, tons of citrus and tropical fruit. So hard to believe this beer is 8.2% because it is soooo smooth, creamy, juicy, but with an awesome hoppy finish on the palate.
Feel - Creamy, full bodied, pillows of citrus goodness. So well balanced with a crisp refreshing carbonation.
Overall - My favorite DIPA to date, hard to believe this is a 97 and Julius is 100. Love Julius but King J is on another level. Can't wait to try this after a week in its vessel. Like all TH beers allow this to come to temp in can for at least 15-20 minutes if you can - you will be rewarded with more intense aromas and taste. This is another 100 for me and not because it's my favorite brewery, Tree House is my favorite brewery because they brew the best beers IMHO. Cheers! 1,328 charactersMatthewHopHead, Dec 06, 2015

L - very similar to Julius. Julius is a hair darker. KJ has a much warmer glow about it. Hazy orange ball of beauty. 
S - a deep, multi-layered aroma with mango at the center. Tons of juice. Latches on and sinks deeper than Julius, which is light and fluffy near the surface, whereas KJ is a little more robust. 
T - pervades the senses. My mouth feels far fuller than it actually is with even the smallest sip. There is such force behind this flavor. It never lets up! A bit of warming booze compliments the look. Penetrating flavors of ripe mango, citrusy orange, and grapefruit is everywhere! These flavor profiles seem much more complex than standard Julius. The Tree House description is spot on. Not just mango, but mango smoothie. Not just orange, but orange creamsicle. Wow. Sweet doughy fresh-baked bread on the finish. 
F - similar to Julius. Light for the heaviness of the rest of the beer, but serves to provide beautiful contrast. Carries the rich flavor to every corner of the mouth- the perfect flavor delivery system. Can't get over how long the flavor lingers. 
O - just when I thought Julius couldn't get any better, I'm hit with The King. 1,208 charactersagreenman19, Dec 05, 2015

The best way I can describe the difference is that the King is loaded with flavor and aroma. So if you have had Julius, try to imagine that (one of which that is already aromatic and flavorful) amped to the next level. Upon cracking open the can, I immediately was bombarded with tropical notes.  The flavor is complex, but melon is the dominant feature.  An awesome beer that only comes out a few times a year, this is worthy of trading for. 565 charactersDolphinsmarlins1, Dec 04, 2015

4.12/5  rDev -13.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This might have been the most disappointing beer I have had to date from Tree House, since in my mind I was imagining a DIPA that would equate to an even better version of Julius. 
What I got was a boozier variant of Julius with markedly less orange flavor throughout, one that felt more like an experimental beer than one worthy of the title of king. 
Was it worth the 1-hour wait in line for a 750ml growler of this beer? Yes, because everyone at the brewery (not just the staff but all the beer drinkers waiting in line) was super cool and, ultimately, I got to share a rare beer with friends, all whom appreciated that fact. Would I do it again? No, since there are many other better DIPA's out there on the market. 
In a way, I am glad that this beer did not blow me away. It means that there is one less whale of a beer for me to chase and one more person in line at Tree House who gets to take home a growler fill. 
In conclusion, Julius is clearly the better beer. 976 charactersrodmanfor3, May 07, 2015

A: Hazy golden orange. Bone white head settles a bit, but retains at a quarter inch cap. Lacing is clumpy and sticky. And coats the whole glass.
S: Vivid, fresh, and awesome. Tropical fruits emanate from the glass. Mango, apricot, cantaloupe, star fruit. Earthy and leafy dimension too. Whiff of alcohol. Malt base smells sturdy and sweet, with aromas of dough and confectioner's sugar. 
T: Taste follows the nose, and exotic tropical fruits really pop. Mango, cantaloupe, apricot, passion fruit, blood orange, star fruit, pineapple. Somewhat leafy and green underneath. Bitterness is gentle. Alcohol is barely noticeable. Dough and confectioner's sugar malt flavors. Dries a little into the finish, which is long and tropical. 
M: Full and thick in the mouth with a soft chewy texture. Tingling carbonation. Astringency is mild. 
O: This is stupid good. It's got such a memorable and vibrant tropical hop profile. It's the type of DIPA brewers dream about crafting. This deserves to be mentioned in any discussion concerning top DIPAs on planet earth. Seriously. 1,102 charactersryan1788a5, May 01, 2015

A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice hazy golden orange juice hue. Really looks like a murky glass of orange juice atop which sat a nice creamy two finger head. It looks outstanding, however, the head fades rather quickly into a thin soapy blanket with ALOT less side lacing that I was expecting from the get go. Still great, but disappointing based off of that initial creamy head impression.
S - Now, I am not going to be as whimsical as JLindros in my review of the nose. I will say he is spot on with that aroma. It bursts out tropical fruits, just oozing out with mango and grapefruit. Some inviting tangerine along with juicy hops. All of this drowns out the malts quite pleasantly.
T - Yeaaah. This is pretty fucking good. Tons of hop oils here, but that takes a back burner to the flavour explosion going on in my mouth. Enormous mango here. Like those delicious Chinese mango gummy candies. Some light resin and faint pith, tangerine and grapefruit rind. There is some light bitterness (grapefruit) but the finish, the finish is a long lingering mango. Supernatural here. 
M - I dont fathom how JLindros did not give this a 5. Sometimes his logic is most illogical. Medium bodied, light but faintly crisp carbonation. 8.3%? Yah, you fooled me. I've had cartons of orange juice (from concentrate) that tasted like they had more alcohol in it than this mouthfeel does. Absurd. EDIT: As this beer warms, some of the booze comes out just a tad. Wish I could go 4.75 but unfortunately cannot.
O - Overall this was an incredible beer. Really wish I did not have to work the days when they're brewery is open so I could go there in person and shake Nate's hand for this and Julius. Enjoy this breweries offerings while you can. Soon enough they WILL explode on the scene. 1,889 charactersrudzud, Dec 09, 2012
4.67/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours into my Hill farmstead stem tulip with a nice creamy but lighter head that hits about 1/2 finger, with some decent sticky lacing... as you mentioned Nate, the lacing on the glass right off the tap was much nicer, but that doesn't stop the awesomness of the beer itself from shining through. Speaking of shining, the beer is not shiny at all, a murky hazy tangerine slightly coppery colored beer.
Nose is amazing! The transcending aroma wafted out as soon as I popped the swing top, and when I poured it I almost dropped the bottle as I was too busy dreaming of the tropical fruits dancing into my brain. This sucker is beaming with tropical fruit and citrus, loaded with passion fruit, mango, a big waft of exploding grapefruit juice packets, tangerine, light orange rind, resins and lots of fresh hop goodness. Under that a light malty aroma tries it's best to balance the hops, to little avail. As I'm burying my nose in it for minutes at a time (literally), and breathing deep, a light booze touch wafts out like an alcohol infused grapefruit.
Taste comes in... I can feel the weight of the beer and oily hop layer before my taste buds come back down to earth from the tropical fruit explosion. Holy shi*t mango! Memories come flying back of chewing on the pit from a mango trying to get that last bit of great mangoness off of it. There is also again some passion fruit, light resins, tangerine, a bit of citrus, and more fresh grapefruit explosions. I can barely put it down long enough to type a sentence. A nice malty base in there, very little malt flavor, but a nice balancing mild sweetness and fluffy feel, it has some weight to it, but no detectable booze. bitterness comes out nicely but not over explosive, or even really strong, its more of an after thought, like the light grapefruit rind bitterness when you're chewing on a fresh grapefruit. Finish is even more grapefruit as the mango fades a bit, a bit of papaya comes out as well, more tangerine and clementine, fairly dry, light lingering bitterness.
Mouth is med to fuller bodied but fluffy and soft, little oily, and quite nice fluffy carbonation.
Overall gmmrrguguumm.... that's the sound my brain is making trying to put words into how awesome this beer is. Easily top 5 DIPAs I've EVER HAD! So much fresh tropical fruit, literally like mango and grapefruit juice, booze is nowwhere to be seen except the nice weight of the body, light hop oil feel, juicy, delicious, drinkable, well balanced, just so friggen good! 2,500 charactersjlindros, Dec 09, 2012
