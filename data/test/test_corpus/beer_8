4.94/5  rDev +5.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5No wax, 2016 bottle. Poured from a 750mL glass into a Perennial stemmed wine glass. 
Pours a thick, viscous motor oil looking body with a dark brown frothy head that reduces to a ring of foam. 
Aromas come out as it warms a little.. Cinnamon and chocolate, coffee and rich fudge. 
As for the taste... this is one of the rare 5/5's i'll ever give a beer in this category. I was afraid this was not going to live up to the hype, but it does. Literally cinnamon toast crunch in thick chocolate milk, rich fudge brownies with hints of chilies, charred malt and coffee, and more cinnamon. No taste overtakes the others, the balance is perfect and so is the mouthfeel. Low carbonation and decadent body. 
This lives up to the hype. What an insanely tasty beer. 758 charactersgcamparone, Apr 06, 2017

4.75/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Nice bouquet of dark fruits.  Rich and robust front palate with raisin and a firm dusting of cinnamon from mid to back. The ancho was probably perfect for my taste, adding just a little "grip" to the overall drink.  Not as dense as other BA stouts I have had, but great finesse.  
Interestingly, this beer engaged the salivary glands like no other beer I have had.  A terrible way to term it...but I can't think of a better...was juicy.  While being a decadent and smooth stout, it was so sessionable and had me wanting to take sip after sip.  Stellar beer. 558 charactersrmpic82, Mar 29, 2017

Brown/black appearance. 
Almost no tan head; almost no lace. 
Marshmallow, cinnamon, graham cracker, cream & sweet chocolate notes in the nose; the aroma was incredible! 
Medium thick mouthfeel. 
Sweet chocolate, marshmallow & cinnamon flavors up front; mild whiskey notes on the finish. Vanilla settled on my lips over the course of the quaff. The nose promised transcendence and the flavor almost delivered. Delicious. 482 charactersGuyFawkes, Feb 14, 2017

4.91/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Rating #2000. Bottled 2/2016
Motor oil pour, no light shines through whatsoever. Head is basically non-existent, leaves huge legs on the glass. Syrupy and sludgy.
Aroma is whiskey soaked fudge, brownies and raisins with some slight fruit/cherry-esque scent coming through. Actually smells very similar to BCBS.
Taste is a perfect balance of whiskey, cinnamon, marshmallow, brown sugar and oak, with rich dark chocolate hitting at the back of the tongue and lingering in the mouth. 
Feel is silky beyond belief and voluptuous on the tongue, zero alcohol heat, no acrid roastiness, carbonation is very low allowing all the flavors to really shine. Peppers are understated on the drink down and prevent it from becoming too sweet. No trace of palate fatigue through the course of the bottle. Not sure how this was achieved. 
Overall, worthy of the hype. Destroys DBH. 869 charactersmig100, Jan 21, 2017

Motor oil thick and with a nice balance of spice (I m not a spice guy either). The heat from the bourbon along with the spice warm you up on the way down. Just an amazing beer , definitely should be top 3 on the 250 list.  
Read a review once on this site and who ever wrote it nailed it..... Cinnamon Toast Crunch......

Light tan head. Black in color.
Tons of cinnamon and vanilla. Very little chipotle heat, however. Chocolate and cocoa. Bourbon and oak. Rich and complex.
Typical Perennial BA stout thickness. Very big. A little spice shows in the finish. 
This is an amazing beer, but I wish it was spicier. It is incredibly thick and smooth. 342 charactersmothman, Oct 23, 2016

S: After I cracked the wax and before I opened the cap, a spicy aroma filled my nostrils. Peppery and cinnamon-forward nose
T: As others have commented, the barrel aging deftly subdues and complements the piquant cinnamon and spicy profile of the base beer. Vanilla beans, dark chocolate, leather, and dried tobacco round out each sip
F: Thick and chewy with a moderate carb
O: Thoroughly enjoyable entry in the barrel-aged spiced stout category. The barrel aging provides a welcomed complexity to an already rich flavor profile. Overall a very impressive stout. 682 charactersFireman_RK, Oct 02, 2016

5/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Holy cow! In a night worthy of any share I've ever been a part of, which included DBH, Westly, Hommage, DBJ, Remy Pappy, Pappy Cake and more, this was the clear winner! It wasn't even close and we drank some amazing beer tonight. Cinnamon Toast Crunch mixed with an amazingly smooth bourbon barrel stout, with some slight pepper heat added in for good measure. One of the best beers I've ever had hands down and I previously rated DBH a 5 (the only 5 I've ever given). I stood by that 5 tonight until I had the BA Abraxas. If DBH is a 5 (which I still think it is) BA Abraxas is a 7. Do whatever you need to do to experience this masterpiece. 642 charactersyumbeer, Jun 12, 2016

Look - motor oily thick, reddish tan head, thick lacing
Smell - bourbon, cinnamon, vanilla, oak, marshmallow, milk chocolate, a little graham crackery.  Probably the best smelling beer I've ever had
Taste - bourbon, oak, peppers after warming, some spice along with cinnamon, milk chocolate
Feel - creamy as heck.  coats the mouth big time, a tad boozy after warming but not in a bad way.  extremely smooth and drinkable
Overall - certainly lives up to the hype, which i wondered how that would be possible.  Really an incredible offering, and really tastes like it has something different than Abraxas in the base.  So creamy and milk chocolatey.  The barrel does wonders for this.  Only knock is that the taste didn't come through as amazing as the smell.  That's nitpicking big time because it was all wonderful and spectacular. 881 charactersrabbott2, May 02, 2016

T: Bittersweet Baker's Chocolate, mild chili and cinnamon spice, alcoholic heat from the barrel, and a touch of vanilla. 
F: Thick, heavy, and full. One of the best I have ever had. 
O: This is an immaculately well balanced beer with a delightful combination of flavors and an exceptional mouthfeel. Certainly one of the top stouts on the market and in the conversation for best in its class. 
BA Abraxas vs. Abraxas:
The barrel-aged version of Abraxas brings about a deeper layer of complexity to an already sensational base beer and enhances the mouthfeel to near perfection. It is a world class stout that is executed virtually flawlessly. It is, however, one of the most difficult beers to acquire, whether by lottery or by trade, and the value of a single bottle -to me- is too high a price to pay for what other beers could be enjoyed in its stead. 
The regular Abraxas is far more approachable and easier to acquire, and carries with it a more pronounced cinnamon spice and roasted malt flavor profile, which is quite inviting. It is a delightful beer that beats out nearly everything else in its category, and minus the mouthfeel, rivals everything its barrel-aged brother offers in a beer. For future visits, regular Abraxas will satisfy my palate quite suitably without the need for barrel-aging. 1,394 charactersrodmanfor3, Mar 08, 2016

It's all the flavors of regular Abraxas pulled together and mellowed out perfectly by the barrel aging process.  One of the richest, thickest, most flavorful beers I've ever had.  The rye whiskey notes balance perfectly with the aroma and taste of the chili, chocolate, cinnamon, and vanilla.  Undoubtedly the best stouts I've ever had the pleasure of tasting, and the 2016 is just as good or better than the 2014.  I count myself fortunate to have had both a taste on draft and taken home a bottle today.  Epic brew.  Hall of fame worthy. 620 charactersrngofpower, Feb 27, 2016

Having lucked out and tasted regular Abraxas so many times, to me the difference with Barrel-Aged Abraxas is subtle.  The barrel flavors hide much of the cinnamon sweetness, which then allows the chili heat to shine a little more on the back end. 362 charactersgibgink, Feb 22, 2016

Nose is complex: spicy dark intrigue
Taste is still dominated by the cinnamon, but less so than regular abraxas. A pretty good balance of really big flavors. I remember there being more bourbon, but still very good stuff
Mouthfeel is thick--probably on par with bourbon county
Mayans would kill for this.  Perennially! 400 charactersbennyman12, Feb 10, 2016

Light heat from the chile's but it helps to liven the experience. 372 charactersKYGunner, Jan 18, 2016

But so did the beer, because this is a fantastic brew.  Love the smell and flavor. Cinnamon, chocolate, perfect blend of roast and bourbon with hints of vanilla. Not overly boozy which I appreciate. You can still taste all the flavors of Abraxas, but with the extra goodness from the barrel.  Truly a beer I had wanted to try for a long time, and it was worth the wait. 475 charactersboothbeer, Nov 16, 2015

Beer pours dark expresso brown with a quick dissipating head.  The nose is out of this world..cinnamon,chocolate,subtle barrel....reminds me of a whiskey spiked desert. Taste follows closely...but I did pick up a little pepper heat on the back end.  Everything blends so perfectly and the high ABV is well hidden.  As the beer warmed....I picked up notes of vanilla, marshmallow, and lactose.  This beer truly lived up to the hype...by far the best I've had. 501 characterslemmy187, Nov 07, 2015

Pours darker than the non-barrel aged Abraxas, with a dark espresso head.  Aroma of cinnamon, rich dark chocolate, vanilla and coconut, and whiskey barrel.  On the taste it remains cinnamon and chocolate heavy with a really nice rich whiskey finish.  
To me this beer was nearly identical to Prop 14 just with a more pronounced whiskey character. 452 characterstimc100, Nov 04, 2015

And rarely do I consider giving a beer a perfect score...but this is as close as it gets. Rich chocolate on the nose, with traces of cinnamon spice and oak. On the tongue, all bets are off...this tastes like a cinnamon roll with a bourbon cream cheese frosting. Sticky, lightly charred on the edges and the faintest spiced oak bite. This is hands down the best beer I've tasted all year, and probably top 5 in my life. 466 charactersbigbluebeerguy, Oct 18, 2015

S: Great and foreboding. The cacao, chiles, cinnamon, and more chiles come through. The barrel presence is minimal.
T: The cinnamon and chiles are the dominant taste. The barrel is subtly hanging out in the background. Reminds of a chile spiced, hot chocolate. However, the chiles were too dominant for me.
F: For my taste, the feel was perfect for an imperial stout. Thick and rich, exactly what I'm looking for in this style.
Overall, a great beer, but the spice level of the chiles was too dominant for me. Beers like this have a difficult time living up to their considerable hype, however I can see how for some people this beer would be near perfection. If the chiles were dialed back a bit, this would be one of my favorite beers. 819 charactersJamLand, Sep 13, 2015

The real question here is whether the BA version is worth the trouble. The regular is so big it already drinks a bit like a BA version, so you would be forgiven if you found this barrel treatment a bit "subtle." There's some wood added to the complex array of cinammon, chilies, chocolate, etc. already going on, but not too, too much. Still, a nice addition to an already world class beer. You're looking at a 10 percent bump in goodness over the original. That's excellent, but not transcendent. You decide whether it's worth it. 580 charactersjjdc, Sep 12, 2015

I wanted more of that beautiful chocolate that regular has. Needless to say it was delicious on draft but would much prefer to try a bottle...then again, swing by the FT:ISO thread and you will realize, so is everyone else in the world. 477 charactersMonktastic7, Apr 30, 2015

The flavor hits of that sweet milk chocolate, some brownie batter, vanilla, raisins, more dark fruit. Then onto a fruit pepper skin with a medium amount of heat. The finish is of cacao along with some bourbon and caramel sweetness.
The barrel character on this is phenomenal along with the already amazing base beer.
Up there with DB Cake and better than DBH. 469 charactersdar482, Apr 28, 2015

4.59/5  rDev -1.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Finally hunted down this miniature whale of mine at a stout tap takeover at local place The Foundry. Titled "Big Ass Stout Day", this is one of the biggest. Six ounces poured into an 8 oz tasting glass.
Appearance (4.25) - Pours an inky brown that might as well be black, with zero light penetrating the event horizon of the beer. Surprisingly, unlike many barrel-aged beers, a reasonable finger of mocha tan head fights through and retains for a minute or so before slinking back to remain a thin ringlet of bubbles around the edge of the glass and a smattering of wispy film on the surface of the liquid. When I drink, a couple small dots of soapy foam cling to the side before sinking back down into the liquid, leaving no lacing to speak of.
Smell (4.5) - While it's missing the cinnamon punch that the non-barrel aged version has, the cinnamon is still there lurking in the background behind an up-front assault of caramel and vanilla, fudge and roasted malt. There is also a hint of whiskey, but the barrel-aging seems to come through more in those sweet notes of graham cracker and vanilla than it does as the more astringent whiskey notes. The score would be higher, but I was hoping against hope that the cinnamon would still be more assertive and blend better with the barrel. Still, it feels a bit like I'm nitpicking...
Taste (4.75) - Here, the fading of the cinnamon and presence of the barrel have reached a harmonious balance. The cinnamon and ancho chiles are subtly intertwined with big rich notes of whiskey barrel--vanilla, caramel, graham cracker--alongside a generous helping of bittersweet chocolate, fudge and roasted malt. If Abraxas were a chocolate-cinnamon cake, then Barrel-Aged is a chocolate-cinnamon cake with dulce de leche sauce drizzled over the top. Just a fantastic tasting beer. But I still want more cinnamon--always more cinnamon.
Mouthfeel (4.5) - Full-bodied and moderate-to-low carbonation, but with enough for the CO2 to provide a nice counterpoint to the more viscous nature of the beer. A little less body than the non-barrel aged version, but that is to be expected. Lingering sweetness on the finish, but subtle.
Overall (4.5), a fantastic beer. It's hard to compare directly to it's base because the barrel aging makes them so fundamentally different, but if I were forced to choose one or the other for the rest of my life, I would probably lean towards regular Abraxas. Still, this is a classic case of splitting hairs--both are excellent beers that have very little room for criticism. 2,541 charactersLambicPentameter, Mar 05, 2015

The nose on this beer is just awesome! Tasting this side by side with the regular abraxas. The barrel adds a flavor profile that in my opinion detracts from the already great base version. The vanilla from the barrel masks the chili heat and mutes the cinnamon. Really good beer but not worth what you would have to give up in trade for a bottle of it. 411 charactersShinck14, Jan 20, 2015

5/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A perfect way to describe this is a cinnamon infused, super fresh dark fudge brownie. Awesome deep fudge notes along with a nice cinnamon hint. Not a cinnamon bomb like others in this style have been. Barrel comes through exactly like it should with subtle whisky notes. Everything compliments each other well. 310 charactersHOPSareKey, Jan 05, 2015

Pours a pretty dark black, with a half inch mocha-colored head, and a little bit of lacing.
Smells tremendously rich and decadent- a huge amount of fudge and aromatic cocoa powder, some rye whiskey, and vanilla. I can't wait to get into this.
This also tastes like a dream. The barreling seems to have amplified the chocolate aspect of this beer, and downplayed the peppers. The peppers are still there, but less so than regular Abraxas. I get also cinnamon, vanilla, oak, spicy rye whiskey, and vegetal pepper with no real actual heat. This is one decadent mofo of a stout.
This is thick bodied, with a creamy, rich mouthfeel, and a lower level of carbonation. Despite the ABV and richness, it's very drinkable.
This is up there with the best stouts I've ever had. It's so well-done. 837 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jan 01, 2015

Pours a viscous black color, with a small, fluffy, dark brown head, leaving back a perfect, thin lacing at the side of the glass.
Smells of sweetened cinnamon on top of earthy malts, bakers chocolate and a gentle amount of coffee. The Bourbon qualities aren't too present on their own, but blend very well into the chili spices, adding heat and wood to the nose. Notes of molasses provide a sweetness to the brew, which gets supported by the omnipresent cinnamon spiciness outstandingly well. 
Begins with rich cinnamon flavors straight from the beginning, while earthy, toasted malts, as well as slightly bitter coffee build the foundation of this beer. The cinnamon gets a bit sticky and dusty, while it turns pretty intense on the palate, with molasses and toffee adding a lot of sweetness to its dominant spiciness. The Bourbon barrel, mirroring the nose, doesn't turn very present on its own, while it interacts perfectly well with the chilies, leaving the spicy cinnamon with an interesting, hot and complex touch on the palate. The sweetness gets balanced by a wooden Bourbon bite, which got a semi dry, bitter aspect to it, highlighting the earthy malts. 
Finishes with a sublte, spicy burn, while coffee becomes more present, still with a slick sweetness detectable, which is now calmed by the wooden maltiness, while the Bourbon shines through in its wooden, vanilla qualities, with a peppery bite. Has an incredible smooth mouthfeel, with a hot burn in the end. The beers body is incredible full and quite different to the normal version, while providing less coffee, way more cinnamon and the proper sweetness. 1,692 charactersaleigator, Dec 27, 2014

Really good beer but not on the same level has Double Hunahpu and not worth what it took to trade for it.  I think I might actually prefer the regular version better. 335 charactersSarge3130, Nov 10, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -9.2%6 oz pour of batch 2.
Smells of cinnamon and chocolate fudge, with the barrel taking the back seat. Taste follows the smell, still not much from the barrel which is quite a letdown. Mouthfeel is creamy and full-bodied. 
Overall, this is a great stout, but the lack of barrel presence in this beer makes it taste more like a year old regular abraxas (which I've had). Not worth the price of admission. Had Proprietors right after, and it was a much better example of a BA stout! 
FYI: The blend is insane! 507 charactersTgmckinn, Sep 30, 2014
4.75/5  rDev +1.5%On tap at City Beer Store during the event with Perennial.  Beer pours pitch black with thick and creamy dark brown head.  Head dissipates to slick of brown after a few minutes, leaving heavy lacing and alcohol legs.  
Nose is really nice, dark chocolate, espresso, graham cracker, cinnamon, vanilla, toasted coconut, sweet fudgy brownie.  Can't really detect any of the chile in the nose.
Taste follows the nose exactly, very well balanced flavors of sweeter fudge and bitter dark chocolate, fruity espresso, graham cracker spices with the extra hit of cinnamon.  Whiskey barrel contributions mid palate as the beer warms with vanilla, toasted oak and vanilla, caramel.  Finish is long and lingering chocolate, spices and the chili hits in the back of the throat, light vegetable and spicy chili.  
Fully body, thick and creamy beer.  Very slow sipper as the flavors are big and bold but balanced, without any alcohol heat.  Very nice beer. 944 charactersnataku00, Sep 29, 2014

4.88/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Bottle from trade, 2014 batch with black wax. Pours incredibly black, inky, viscous, and ends up with a finger and a half of dark brown head, creamy looking, too. Incredible aroma of sweet chocolate and cinnamon, spicy rye whiskey, very very faint peppers, vanilla, roasted marshmallows. It's like cinnamon s'mores with whiskey, though the whiskey supports rather than overpowers the smell. Flavor follows with awesome cocoa powder and cinnamon, vanilla whiskey notes, ever so slight spice and warmth that lingers from a combination of the peppers and the alcohol. Thick and viscous, though not syrupy, low carbonation but enough bubbles to keep things thick, and very rich with a slightly roasty dry finish. I was expecting more whiskey on this one, but it melds into the beer so well. Seems very much worth the hype here. Incredible beer, though still takes a back seat to DB Huna for me. 890 charactersBMMillsy, Sep 21, 2014

4.8/5  rDev +2.6%Picked out by my lovely wife to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary, & that’s about all you need to know about what a fine bride I have. Fifteen years. Damn. 750ML bottle I won in the lottery this year…which I entered once. On a whim. After a drunken tasting. Lucky me!
Pour is black, carbonation active for a beer of its weight. The nose is delicious but hard to tease apart – other than the chocolate, which has fudgy hands all over the aroma. Underneath is gorgeous vanilla, warm chilies, more sweetness from the malts. The balance is exquisite. 
Abraxas – Barrel Aged is simply a world-class beer even with one of my favorite ingredients, dry-hopped hype. But hell, the base beer is nearly perfect; how much better could a barrel make it? What’s astounding is that you can swish this beer around in your mouth & identify each lovely taste: strong natural vanilla, artisan chocolate that washes through & around every component of the beer, light cinnamon. Chilies hit the sweet spot in the bat, neither under- nor over-done, providing light without heat, so to speak. Whiskey barrel? Barely visible on the aftertaste, slight enough that it could be missed amidst the harmony of flavors. This is a beer that, if I could get enough of it, I’d drink constantly. This should come with an IV kit. 
An elite-level beer: but if you’re not a ticker, steer clear. The barrel really adds minimally to what was already an incredible stout. Get thee some regular old Abraxas, son, & know that you’re not missing much by not having this whale. Except a similarly great brew. 1,589 charactersmaximum12, Sep 16, 2014

A- Beautiful sludge. Finger of brown head fades within a minute or so. You're not gonna get more black than this. An intimidating and ominous onyx.
S- Big time bourbon and chocolate/fudge right off the bat. Some delicate cinnamon follows. Splendid barrel character on this beer lending some vanilla and caramel to the mix. The bourbon rides the whole way through. I would give it a five, but I'm not smelling any spice. Especially compared to regular Abraxas.
T- Bourbony fudge and dark/sweet chocolates with hints of cinnamon. Can't get over how wonderful this beer takes to bourbon. The tannins provide a understated vanilla/toffee flavor. While I didn't get spice on the nose, I'm getting hints of it here and there on the flavor. There is also the faintest bit of booze, but it only adds to the complexity. Such balance here.
M- Thick. Oily. Awesome. 
There are few imperial stouts that I would like to, and probably could, drink the whole bottle. I wish I wasn't so generous in sharing this bottle, cause I could've taken it out alone. 6-7 ounces was such a tease. But who doesn't like to be teased? If the opportunity arises, I must trade for this beer again. Phenomenal stuff. 1,368 charactersjbwimer, Aug 13, 2014

A- Pours a thick, viscous motor-oil black with a small light brown head that recedes to a film and leaves some lacing. When swirled some nice alcohol legs are visible.
S- Massive waves of cinnamon and chocolate waft out of the glass immediately! Tons of sweet chocolate and bitter dark chocolate. There is almost a maple syrup smell, and some molasses going on. Fudge and some whiskey and vanilla. The nice touch of chilies gives a spicy and sweet touch that rounds this out. So complex and so fantastic!
T- It bursts with flavors as soon as it hits the tongue! Bitter dark chocolate up front, followed by loads of chili peppers, and a whole lot of whiskey as well. Some dark roasty malts give some coffee-like flavor. Hints of cinnamon and vanilla add to the complexity. A lot of boozy heat and spicy heat make this a very slow sipper.
M- Incredibly thick and viscous, nice carbonation, dry, and a good bit of heat.
O- This is just an awesomely crafted beer that hits so many different notes without being messy! I personally would prefer a little less booze and heat to allow for some other flavors to shine more, but it's a very minor complaint! 1,186 charactersSadMachine, Aug 02, 2014

4.43/5  rDev -5.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.52014 release, black waxed. Tulip glass.
A: Pours night black with some swirls of medium brown head which dissipates immediately, leaving a thin ring of sand colored head. No lacing to speak of; retention is below average, as after a few minutes the surface looks completely still. 
S: Rich cinnamon and vanilla, mixed in with dark hot chocolate and a bit of oak which really enhances the vanilla, and a touch of whisky as it warms completely. A little dark fruit from the malt which adds a nice dimension of complexity.
T: Again, rich, dark cocoa melds with vanilla bean, and a wisp of chili spice carries through to the finish, and just a touch of whiskey on the finish. You can barely detect the alcohol—a bit of burn is evident—but it’s mostly hidden under the other elements.
M: Thick, mouthcoating on the palate, giving a perfect impression of Mexican hot chocolate. Light carbonation.
O: Very tasty, they really nailed the Mexican stout style. But the barrel treatment is very light, almost to the point of not being noticeable. Thus, even though the barrel treatment smooths out some of the rough edges of the regular version, the value added is almost negligible. 1,182 characterspmarlowe, Jul 05, 2014

5/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A- Pours as thick as molasses and black as December midnight. Dark brown, rich, chocolatey colored head forms and retains prety well. Looks a little intimidating in the glass. High carbonation for the style is both visibily and audibly evident during the pour.
S- Dark, spicy, sweet, and a touch bitter on the nose. Dark malts and barrel are the dominant flavors in the scent, with vanilla sweetness and oaky spiciness being the prominent barrel flavors. The dark malt is s tough burnt and a touch bitter, but great notes of chocolate and just a little tiny bit of the peppers.
T- Starts off with a bang of chocolate and burnt dark malts and then moves straight toward the barrel. The barrel flavors present are led by a sweeter vanilla and a fairly spicy oak, just like in the scent. The chocolate comes rushing back, but this time has a new partner in crime; cinnamon. Malts quickly move in on the cinnamon's territory and take back over with just a touch of the spicy peppers.
M- Thick, smooth, creamy, and of course boozey the whole way. This beer drinks like a champ, but still displays its power in a combination of alcohol burn and rye barrel flavors. Not quite a sipper, only because the flavors are so damn delicious.
Overall, this beer lives up to the hype, enough said. I'm a little sad that I traded one away. 1,325 charactersboilermakerbrew, Jul 03, 2014

It tastes like a rich, fudge brownie with spices and maybe a bourbon glaze. The mouthfeel sets this beer apart. It is as rich as Bourbon County series. The cinnamon and hints of chili are still there to poke through and make this beer interesting. There are hints of vanilla and certainly some booziness. Absolutely decadent and delicious. 427 charactersPHBoiler, Jun 30, 2014

4.72/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75On tap at the Great Taste. I still remember the taste of this beer which I got about 4 ounces of. I honestly should not be doing this as a review but I have to share my thoughts on this beer right now for my own record-keeping purposes.
This beer poured out of the pitcher a dark brown, nearly black body with a nice 1cm mocha head that dissipated over a few minutes into pretty much nothing, not even a film. It looked very viscous. As I drink it down, you can see cinnamon particles on the sides of the glass plus a decent bit of lacing. That tells me the beer is sticky as hell.
The beer smells like cinnamon toast crunch with chocolate milk. It smells so decadently chocolatey sweet mixed with straight up vanilla and so, so much cinnamon. I tried but could not get any of the spicy peppers in the nose. It's very strong and pungent, I really enjoyed smelling this beer!
The taste is where the money is at. It's pure cinnamon up front tempered by a sweet milk chocolate flavour. Then there's a burst of vanilla throughout, a sweet kind of vanilla that combines with everything to make this beer sort of taste like liquid marshmallows. And that's not all- there is a not-very-subtle peppery spiciness that burns a decent bit on the back end. It is all in all, a delicious beer and a major improvement on the regular Abraxas- which didn't have that marshmallowy flavour to it.
Mouthfeel is great- very full bodied, creamy and viscous beer with a spicy peppery kick on the back-end. I was so happy with my four ounce pour, I would absolutely accept more but this beer was just so thick, decadent and rich that I was satisfied after 4 ounces. No booziness at all in this beer, and everything was so well integrated.
Overall, absolutely worth the hype. The regular Abraxas is awesome but this took it to a whole other level. That marshmallowy chewiness on top of the cinnamon, peppers and chocolate was just something else entirely. It's not Bourbon Barrel Vanilla Bean Dark Lord but it's not very far off from that either.
Re-review: Batch 2 black wax bottle poured into a FFF/DMC snifter 6/21/2014. Same appearance and mouthfeel as described above. The nose and palate seem to be rather focused around the bourbon barrel-aging and cinnamon sticks. There is some chocolate fudge from the malts, but it tastes like bourbon soaked cinnamon sticks. Which is certainly excellent. Still, I am missing some of the complexities of the base Abraxas beer, especially in comparison to Double Barrel Hunahpu's which we drank just before opening this one. This is certainly an excellent choice if you enjoy cinnamon spices and barrel-aged stouts, but it may very well not be worth the price of admission. As usual, I won't be changing the score based on the initial review, but this would be something more like a 4.55 if I did.. then again, I'm comparing this to a top 5 beer in Double Barrel Huna, so it doesn't reflect particularly poorly on this excellent stout.
Re-re-review: Batch 3, released February 2016. Served out of the bottle, into a brandy snifter glass. Same dark black body, oily, a bit of leg. Smells of cinnamon, vanilla, cocoa, milk chocolate, plenty of whiskey, dark chocolate fudge much like the blue label Maman they had on tap at the same venue. Flavour is cinnamon toast crunch with vanilla and milk chocolate, fair bit of whiskey but nothing boozy or overwhelming. So much flavour to this beer, very similar to Batch 1 (read above) than it is to Batch 2 (also read above). The ingredients add onto the excellent BA base beer that is Maman and they all play together very well. Mouthfeel is full bodied, thick and creamy, like a cinnamon toast crunch marshmallow milkshake. A bit of prickly peppery heat, perhaps a little bit of whiskey, hard to tell, cuts the sweetness on the backend. Really drinkable, very savory and wonderful. At this point, Batch 3 = Batch 1 > Batch 2. That's the way I see it from memory. One of the best tasting, most memorable and flavourful stouts I've ever had.
Re-re-re-review: 2013, 2014 and 2016 barrel-aged Abraxas out of the bottle. Served in stemmed glassware 4/30/2016. Essentially, while 2013 was still tasting very good, it is a shadow of its former self. The 2016 has clearly supplanted 2013 at this point, bringing what was so great about it fresh- marshmallow cinnamon toast crunch. The bourbon presence and mouthfeel is just perfect on this beer, with a full substantial body. 2014 is somewhere in between; it never had the big cinnamon toast crunch presence that 2013 and 2016 boasted when fresh. So in summary, 2016 is drinking fantastic, but my recommendation is to not let it sit more than a year or two. 4,669 charactersStevedore, Jun 22, 2014

A- Poured pitch black with nearly no head. Thin dark brown head left little lacing.
S- Hint of chocolate and coffee hard to place due to strong bourbon nose.
T- More complex than the base for me. Hint of cinnamon with strong coffee and chocolate notes finishing with bourbon notes and slight burn. The only knock is that as it reached room temp the bourbon notes took over and it lost it's complexity. 
M- This is the one. Definitely my favorite mouthfeel for this style. Viscous but goes down smooth and has an amazing backbone to carry the complex flavors. 
O- By far the best "Mexican" stout I've had. Will be seeking out additional pours at upcoming tap takeovers. Setting the standards high for the BA Mexican Cakes next month. 800 charactersJared14, Jun 08, 2014

4.93/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served on draft at bottle pick up day today. Was really excited to try this, just had DB Hunahpu no more than two weeks ago. Poured on draft by Pete into a snifter glass at Perennial. This is Batch 2.
A - Extremely dark pour with a minimal 1/4 finger dark mocha foam head that slowly recedes but leaves the mocha ring around the glass. This guy has some legs on it.
S - Smell is rich chocolate coffee smells mixed with cinnamon on the front with some light hints of vanilla and whiskey on the end. It all blends together into a mesmerizing smell.
T - The taste follows the nose with almost a Cinnamon toast crunch flavor but with more chocolate coffee flavors on the front of the palate. The cinnamon lingers throughout the sips as I swish it about my mouth. It finishes with a cinnamon vanilla whiskey ever so slight burn.
M - This is probably the most perfect mouthfeel I've ever had on a stout. Within the style this is no. 1 for me. Chewy viscous creamy smooth beer that sits in your mouth and coats the entire inside. This really is a top beer in the world. The mouthfeel is to die for on draft. lets hop the bottle is that same.
O - I was not expecting as much cinnamon, but with the base it was obviously going to be there. This rivals DB Hunahpu as the best mexican style stout in the world, I am just missing AB Mexi Cake now! This was everything that I thought it would be and is dead even or even slightly ahead of DB Huna. I will be doing a side by side here soon to tell for sure!

Light fizzy head, dark creamy head covering fades instantly, pitch black color with great legs. 
Nose is awesome, coconut surprisingly, great dark choc, creamy choc, vanilla barrel, so much cocoa, toasted barrel, melting choc, little caramel, decent cinnamon. Amazing. 
Taste great choc, lots of cinnamon, hot spicy cinnamon, great coconut, vanilla barrel, bitter dark choc, thick melting choc, light vanilla barrel, dark choc, little creamy, mild hot booze, little nutty and thick dark malt. Finish is semi sweet and lots of hot cinnamon and booze, more big coconut and vanilla barrel. 
Mouth is med to fuller bod, decent carb, some warming booze little creamy and melting choc. 
Overall great other than really spicy cinnamon is a bit too much, but otherwise awesome, great coconut and choc. 894 charactersjlindros, Apr 04, 2014

An aggressive pour yields a beautiful pitch black body with a quickly fading one finger caramel-colored head with basically no lacing. The nose is complex and incredible! The chilies, cacao nibs, and cinnamon are all equally represented, and when you throw in the whiskey barrel, it's over the top! Also getting coconut and vanilla along with hints of dark chocolate and booze. The taste is just as complex. Once again, everything comes through as advertised, which isn't always the case with these types of beers. Huge cinnamon notes, huge cacao, and huge, but not too huge, chili peppers. Tons of dark chocolate fudge and coconut, along with hints of oak, vanilla, whiskey, tobacco, and subtle dark fruits. The mouthfeel is thick and rich and incredibly smooth. The heat from the chilies is there, but it's perfection. Too many times with chili beers, the peppers overwhelm and distract. But not with this beer. Overall, this beer delivers in every way. All the advertised elements were bold, yet equally represented. Can't think of any other beer that delivered on what was advertised quite like this. Highly recommended! 1,187 charactersbeerdrifter, Feb 22, 2014

T - Loads of dark chocolate, cinnamon, and sweet milk. Caramel in the mild and a slight roasted aspect which reminds me a bit of cinnamon toast crunch or rum chata. Warming alcohol and pepper heat near the backend as well as dark bitter chocolate 
M - Creamy mouthfeel with light carbonation to prevent it from being cloying. Finish is slightly astringent from the dark chocolate and has some slight heat
O - Really good BA beer and I think they must add more cinnamon as this has much more cinnamon and flavor than regular. The barrel adds some slight bourbon sweetness to it and rounds out the flavors of the regular Abraxas 828 charactersjeonseh, Jan 13, 2014

4.13/5  rDev -11.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4From notes.  Draft and Bainbridge Street Barrel House in Philadelphia, PA. 
Pitch black and completely opaque without even a trace of lighter color.  Half finger dark mocha head that quickly settles into a thin ring.  Minimal spotty lacing left behind.  Nice color but has poor retention.  Foam head fades and there's not much in the way of lacing.  
The nose on this beer is really incredible.  Excellent barrel character that doesn't completely overpower the complex malt bill of the base.  Perfectly integrated.  A touch of damp oak and subtle toothpick but not too strong of a wood flavor.  Really nice spirit with spicy whiskey/boozy bourbon flavor.  Barrel also gives off a lot of vanilla bean, toasted coconut and gooey marshmallow.  Underneath, there is a very nice blend of roasted and sweet, desert-like malts.  Subtle roast but not overpowering with some coffee bean, burnt toast, smoke, oatmeal and bitter dark chocolate.  This is countered by silky chocolate-like sweetness, caramel, milk chocolate, lactic cream, fudge and molasses.   This beer smells crazy good. 
Full body with oily viscosity and a blast of boozy heat that lingers over the other barrel notes and complex malts into a dry, hot finish.  Lots of alcohol flavor and the ABV isnt very well masked.  spicy rye whiskey along with dry oak/toothpick.  Barrel isn't as complex as in the nose.  Spirit is really strong and it has a stronger wood flavor than I prefer.  Some subtle vanilla/coconut sweetness.  Malts flavors are still lingering underneath but they are blasted and overwhelmed by the heat/whiskey.  Stronger roasted malt presence than expected with burnt sugary sweetness.  Deeply roasted robust espresso/coffee flavor along with smoke, burnt wood, charred toast and bitter dark cocoa.  As the palate adjusts the sweet fudge/baker's chocolate notes start to show.  Pretty good but isn't as complex as expected.  The chile spiciness and cinnamon show up after it warms but the palate needs to adjust to the overwhelming whiskey and heat.   Smells great but it's really hot and boozy and the malt bill is overly charred/roasted.  Decent but kind of underwhelming considering the fanfare. 2,175 characterscorby112, Dec 28, 2013

A- Jet black same old saying. Minimal lacing that goes away quickly.
S- Cinnamon forward. How the hell did they get sooo much cinnamon into a ba beer? Cinnamon Toast Crunch followed by slight whiskey stout. I am impressed. 
T- Again, cinnamon toast crunch, but less sugary with more whiskey obviously, and anise/licorice present with chocolate. A terrific beer, everything that it is hyped to be; and waaay better than non-ba abraxas. I would love to try the new coffee abraxas; for another time.
M- Pretty thick here for a ba stout. This is the mouthfeel that I like in a ba stout. 
O- This beer is sooo different from anything that I have had before. I am soooo happy I have another to revisit. 790 charactersgueuzedreg, Nov 27, 2013

A- dark as night. Looks thick, viscous and still as can be in the glass. A dark tan, cake like head settles to a picturesque ring. Beautiful beer.
S- Aroma detected from a foot away amidst the fried potatoes and burger smell from the kitchen. Cocoa nibs lead the way of decedent fine chocolate. Vanilla wafers, lactose, and strong whiskey presence that makes itself known. Cinnamon and brown sugar in the finish that paves the road for the chili spice aroma. Quite possibly the best smelling beer i have encountered. 
T- All the flavors the nose detected with maybe a slightly stronger whiskey character. Cinnamon hits first for me, followed by milk chocolate, marshmallows, some coconut and vanilla. Burn throughout is a little distracting. I get it...it's 11%, but there is a difference between the booze adding depth and becoming distracting
M- Subtle carb, full body, creamy, and fairly drinkable. The booze presence is almost as if I'm taking a shot of whiskey with each sip.
O- A truly impressive brew that I am glad to have gotten my hands on. Maybe I would prefer a more tempered booze presence, but I am probably in the minority there. Love the cinnamon toast crunch quality. Can't wait to try the non-barrel aged version. 1,314 charactersBosoxfan20, Nov 23, 2013

A - Pours black with a nice one and a half finger tall tan head, quickly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small trails of lace down the sides of the glass.
S - Smells of warm bourbon, strong chili heat, room temperature chocolate, vanilla beans, fresh ground cinnamon and a bit of light booze. Was really hard to finish my glass because it smelled so incredible.
T - Starts off with a quick hit of chocolate, caramel and vanilla sweetness quickly being joined by hints of cinnamon, chillies, drying oak and smooth bourbon burn. Finish is pretty sweet with some heat, lingering for quite awhile. Not as intoxicating as the nose but still really damn good.
M - Heavy body with moderate carbonation. Despite the big, roasty body it was still really smooth, only a bit of booze creeping in at the end of each sip.
O - This might be the best chili stout I have ever had. It packs all of the flavors I enjoyed in the base beer and the bourbon was strong but not over the top. I really loved the choice of rye barrels for this one, really brought it all together. I would love to have this again in the future. 1,222 charactersorangesol, Nov 06, 2013

A- Pours a pitch black with a slight mocha brown head that recedes at a moderate pace to a still top and just a slight ring around the edges of the glass, fairly minimal lacing, some alcohol legs appear on the sides of the glass. Looks fairly similar in appearance to regular Abraxas.
S- Coconut, dark chocolate, cinnamon, hint of peppers. Very well balanced, fairly aromatic.
T- Shaved coconut, creamy dark chocolate, balanced cinnamon, nice subtle pepper presence on the back-end that balances nicely with the sweetness, integrated bourbon that accentuates the sweetness in a good way, finishes with more coconut- can definitely see how the Almond Joy references come into play as shredded coconut and creamy dark chocolate are the two most prevalent flavors. Overall nice sweetness without being too cloying and a very nice balance, much better then the regular Abraxas in which I find the cinnamon to be a little bit too dominant.
M- Medium bodied, fitting carbonation for the style, highly drinkable, extremely smooth, and just the right amount of creaminess.
O- BA Abraxas was a fantastic stout that had the perfect balance between barrel presence, sweetness, etc.. I'm glad I finally got to try this sought after beer and in my opinion it definitely lived up to it's hype and showcases what the barrel program at Perennial is capable of. It's a close call but this was probably my favorite of the chili stout tasting we did which included most of the heavy hitters in the chili stout world (BA Hunahpu, BA Mexican Cakes, Muerte Dark Lords, Papi Negro, etc.). 1,730 charactersjaasen64, Oct 23, 2013

A - Pours a dark chocolate brown with a small dark brown head that quickly fades to the edges.
S - Whiskey first, then the chilies hit, finally the cacao and cinnamon in the finish.

D - Low carbonation with a heavy body.

4.89/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured from the bottle into a Funky Buddha snifter
Pours jet black with a very interesting golden tint which I assume is from the cinnamon with a small tan head that fades pretty quickly.
The smell is cinnamon and I mean a lot of it. Reminded me a lot of Apple Brandy Mexican Cake with the cinnamon smell and a little bit of cocunut. As it warms this is where you get the barrel. It is mellow whiskey, but it is there and it makes you realize how perfectly nuanced this beer is. 
The taste is more cinnamon, but not as overpowering as I have heard others mention. Too me it was like Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but not sugary sweet like it. Again it is very nuanced with the cinnamon, sugar, chcolate and barrel. Having never had the regular version, I imagine that the barrel has really mellowed out some of the cinnamon. You get a light heat at the end from the chiles but thankfully they are verfy mellow compared to a beer like Hunahpu which I find a little overpowering with the heat. 
Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and again very little heat from the chilies or alcohol. This beer is extremely drinkable for a stout and especially one brewed with cinnamon and chiles. 
I was expecting this beer to be a cinnamon heat bomb like Hunahpu and I was more than surprised. I knew it was good, but this beer really takes it to a level that makes me wish it wasn't so hard to find this beer. If you love beers like Prarie Bomb or any version of Mexican Cake this beer will blow your mind. 1,486 charactersmcgwire756, Sep 06, 2013

Pours a murky black/brown color, some head but it dissipates quickly. 
Aroma is really heavy on the cinnamon. Actually everything about this beer is about the cinnamon. Plenty of booze present too, along with some wood and chocolate. Not a bad start but I'm scared of how sweet this is going to be. 
Flavor is as feared: too heavy on the cinnamon and sugar. The upside is that there is some whiskey, toasted wood, and chocolate behind that. Unfortunately there are also roast, burnt, and all around astringent flavors. Not overly bitter. 
Body is heavy, unsurprisingly but it's a good thickness. Could use some more carbonation. 782 characterst0rin0, Aug 30, 2013

The beer pours an opaque dark brown/black color with not much head to speak of. The smell is divine. As good as this beer tastes, it smells even better. I'm getting pepper spice with sweet cocoa and notes of coconut and cinnamon. The taste is a bitter sweet dark chocolate. The peppers burn and the burn increases as the beer warms. I'm getting some cinnamon and smooth bourbon. There is a roasty note that reminds me of coffee. The body is thick and syrupy, smooth and sticky on the mouth. There is a tingly carbonation and you can feel a slight burn. This is an awesome beer and I'd love to have more in the future. 729 charactersoline73, Aug 18, 2013

A - Poured a thick, sludgy ink black colour with a thin layer of espresso coloured that quickly reduced to a ring around the glass.
S - A big (unexpected) coconut aroma up front that is followed by a big sweet cocoa aroma and notes of char, whiskey, chilli peppers and a touch of smoke. An absolutely wonderful nose.
T - A huge toasted coconut flavour up front that gives way to cinnamon and ancho chilli notes that come through beautifully in flavour without a lot of heat. Sweet chocolate and molasses notes enter mid-palate and balance out the spices nicely. The barrel presence is more muted than expected but adds a nice layer of whiskey and char notes throughout and a touch of vanilla that shows up in the finish. The flavours work so well together and are well integrated with the barrel aging. 
M - Full body. Somewhat viscous. Light to moderate carbonation. 
O - This beer was flawless. 930 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Aug 14, 2013

A: It's dark in the restaurant, but by candlelight... the beer is black. A little rim of mocha head. Not many bubbles.
S. Holy f. Smells like... cinnamon, vanilla, cocoa. Like a chocolate cake. Or a Mexican spicy chocolate bar. Not a whole lot of bourbon, but it's there.
T. Tastes like someone took a cup of sweet Mayan hot chocolate, cooled it down, added more cinnamon and vanilla to it, and then magically made it alcoholic. There is a lot going on in this beer. The cinnamon dominates, at least initially. Then there's the vanilla and chocolate flavors that ramp up, followed by a real pleasant slow burn from the chiles. The burn masks the alcohol perfectly. And then... coffee is the aftertaste.
M: Fantastic, smooth, perfectly carbonated.
O: Yet again I'm forced to hold this up to my favorites of all time: BCBCS, Black Note and BCBS. BA Abraxas is easily in the top 5 stouts for me, but it doesn't beat out my standards. There's something almost sort of... novelty?... about it. It seems weird to say it, but there's almost too much going on here. But all in all, delicious and I'm glad to have tried it. 1,206 charactersnihiloexnihil, Aug 13, 2013

The beer is black with a thin beige collar. The nose is phenomenal. Chocolate, cinnamon sticks, spicy chilis. Unbelievable flavor, with everything coming together in beautiful harmony.

Visuals look good and smell is great.
Taste is completely different from what I recall the non-BA version to be. Whereas the flavors in the regular version were quite muddled, I get distinct cinnamon, chile, and chocolate flavors out of this. Very tasty. However, I get no barrel presence at all on this beer.
Overall, I finally understand the hype and ratings behind this beer. More barrel presence would be nice, but it is quite delicious. 581 charactersthebigredone, Aug 11, 2013

T - BA Abraxas opens up with vanilla chocolate cinnamon on the front of the tongue. This moves on to more pronounced flavors of chocolate and cinnamon. The bourbon barrel moves in and assert its presence by adding a boozy oaky vanilla caramel layer on top. Ends spicy hot with cinnamon. The barrel aging does a really nice job of not being overly boozy, yet also adding really nice complexity and taking Abraxas to a new level.
M - Mouth is smooth and goes down well, which is surprising given this brewery usually has thinner bodied beers
D - Overall. This is a solid, solid barrel aged beer. Added a nice layer of bourbony complexity to an already great beer. 938 charactersbirchstick, Jul 31, 2013

Inky opaque pour. Medium dark coffee head. Nose is cinnamon graham cracker, intense Mexican chocolate with Ancho chili, flashes of American sweet tomato paste bourbon a la fifty fifty eclipse series. Body brings out immediate silky melted dark chocolate, powerful bourbon but no white alcohol or tomato paste. The back end gives tremendous chili heat, cinnamon, dessert spices, bourbon warming. Heating, face flushing back end. Rich, well integrated. This is essentially a redux of Cigar City Hunahpu without the lemon acid and thin tea body. Very delicious and worth the hype. Very thankful to try this thanks to Gene. 4.3 level off the bat. But as it warms, I’m going to equate this experience with the best of Bourbon County Stout bottles I’ve had and make sure it gets the 4.5 it deserves.

From a 750 into a snifter
Bottled January 2013
Drunk right after a regular from December 2011
APPEARANCE: Thick, sludgy black pour yields a one finger, fizzy, dark mocha colored head with relatively lousy retention. Slightly darker head than the regular version. Pitch black body with a stream of carbonation up the middle, making the wisp fly around the glass. Kind of entertaining. A swirly wisp remains but leaves no real lacing down the glass. Great body, but lack-luster head. 
SMELL: Quite barrel forward. Whisky, oak, vanilla and sweet cream on the nose. Heavy barrel components. Some cinnamon and chillies under all the barrel aromas, but they're in the background. Big and interesting. 
TASTE: Much more adjunct forward than the nose had led on. Definite cinnamon up front with chillies and whisky barrel flavors for sure. Oak, vanilla and sweet cream accompany the whisky through the middle into the finish. Lots of chillies, sweet cinnamon, bitter chocolate and some roasted flavors linger beside the whisky barrels. Really complex and flavorful, with great balance between the barrel aging and adjuncts. A small chilli bite hangs around as well. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. A touch lighter than the regular version. Creamy on the palate, smooth going down with a bit of a chilli bite after the swallow and finishes sticky on the palate. A bit of heat accompanies the hot chillies as well. 
OVERALL: This was excellent. Balanced really well, with the whisky barrel being evenly matched with the adjuncts of the base beer. Well executed. The feel could be a little heavier, which would really take it to the next level, but that is a minor issue. Really enjoyable and I'm really glad I had the chance to give this a try. Cheers again bsuedekum. Very much recommended. 
As a side note, this BA version is from a more recent batch, so the adjuncts are still quite forward. I'm definitely not a huge chilli fan myself and I found it just fine, but if you'd prefer less cinnamon and chillies, give it some time in the cellar. The adjuncts in the regular base beer from December 2011 had really faded, so it won't take long. 2,234 charactersJeffo, Jun 20, 2013

Light bourbon nose, with spice and cinnamon, and slight peppery heat, with roast, char, and chocolate. Tasted heavies on the cinnamon. Light spiciness, medium barrel with touches of booze and a cocoa powder finish. Thick and creamy, full bodied, heavy.
The over the top cinnamon is a little detracting for me, as its not a flavor I like, but worked well for it. I like Hunaphu better due to its balancing flavors, but this was really good. 535 charactersEgadBananas, May 30, 2013

A: Black with some slight carbonation
S: Simply amazing; this smells like cinnamon/spice/vanilla/chocolate and in no specific order. This is a very balanced dessert.
T: Pretty good, but not my favorite of the style. Huge cinnamon and spice followed by subtle chocolate and vanilla. I got zero barrel out of it, but that is not a complaint as the traditional oak/bourbon notes may be a bad thing for this style.
M: Not as thick as a big RIS or BA RIS, but definitely not thin. 
O: This is definitely an amazing imperial mole stout and the barrel aging really enhances the cinnamon/spice/vanilla/chocolate flavor and smell. Definitely way better than regular Abraxas and probably the best smelling stout I've ever had; however, I do prefer Hunahpu as I tend to like the Vanilla/Chocolate to be the dominating flavors. 
I definitely recommend trying to get ahold of this beer, but not at the current asking price in ISO:FT. It is amazing, but there are a lot of beers out there equally as good or better. 1,169 charactersDrucifer, May 05, 2013

on to the brew,
i'll keep this short and sweet, unlike the abraxas
pours as thick as motor oil, no question about that one, I really don't know if subconsciously that effects my perception of a stout as I usually would expect a thicker stout to be more well-crafted than a stout with high abv and be thin, something like regular dark lord. no matter.
smells likes 100 percent dark fruits. thick, heavy dark fruits and not a trace of anything else. i myself don't enjoy that smell or taste so i wasn't particularly pleased.
taste- HOLY MOLY! sensational! AMAzing! other positive adjectives! dark dark dark cocoa with an amazing zesty cinnamon taste that blasted through my palate like a JDAM on a bunker in afghanistan. i have never tasted anything like that, the cinnamon note did not go away for at least 3 minutes after the first sip. the mouthfeel was probably the best i have ever experienced. this is an awesome beer. i got no dark fruits and no alcohol. it was a heavy as you can imagine but didnt actually weigh me down like you would expect. 
Great beer, all other imperial stouts need not apply 1,256 charactersjsm1289, Apr 28, 2013

A- Pours a deep black with a thin dark mocha head. Minimal lacing left behind.
S- One of the best smelling beers I've had. Freshly baked cinnamon rolls with icing. Notes of spicy dark chocolate chili bars, whiskey, oak, toast and brown sugar. 
T- Plenty of dark and milk chocolate mingled with cinnamon and brown sugar covered toast, vanilla, slightly spicy chilies and whiskey.
M- Lower carbonation with a rich mouthfeel with a bit of heat at the end from the higher abv and chilies. Still, the abv is hidden quite well. 
O- An early contender for one of the best beers I've had this year. Everything works so well together in this beer as it's not overly hot nor spice forward. Hopefully they will make a bigger batch next time! 793 charactersiadler, Apr 14, 2013

Thanks to TheAbyss for the bottle hookup!
Pours dark and black with a tan head. Little retention and some lacing down the glass.
Lots of milky cocoa, cinnamon and spice just like the regular version, but also well integrated whiskey that enhances the spice component with a little rye kick. The barrel is far from overpowering lending additional flavors instead of overpowering them.
Really like what the barrel has done for the flavor. Milk chocolate up front with some light roasted malts and brown sugar. Vanilla from the barrel is not as prominent as some others which is good for keeping the sweetness in check. The whiskey really kicks in towards the end creating a pleasant burn along with the spices. All is integrated beatifully with restaint on the barrel. Overall the impression I get from this is adult Cinnamon Toast Crunch with the cinnamon and brown sugar playing very well with the whiskey
Fairly heavy bodied. Very chewy and lower in carbonation than the non-BA version. Just a little residual heat and alcohol linger on the tongue. Hides the alcohol very well for a beer this size.
Wonderful beer and one of the few hype trains I've had recently that's worth it. The flawless flavor integration is what makes this one stand out. Everything seems to have a purpose and works together well. 1,380 charactersjmarsh123, Mar 28, 2013

A - Dark tan foam settles to a thick collar, a few stray wisps on top, and a few specks of lace. Very dark brown body that verges on black.
S - The whiskey integration here is well-done, and the spicy rye notes complement the massive cinnamon and milder chile flavors. I'm actually surprised by how restrained the barrel is given this was aged for 11 months. Stout flavors tend to take a back seat to the adjuncts, with an unclear boundary between cocoa nibs and malt. Quite nice all the same.
T - The taste is of similar quality, with a medley of spicy rye whiskey, chiles, cocoa nibs, oak, and a dialed down level of cinnamon here. Vanilla shows up, but is quite light, and a caramel and lightly roasted malt backbone shows up to support the complex array of barrel and adjuncts.
M - Medium-full body, chewy, with appropriate lower carbonation, and a bit of lingering chile heat. Alcohol is very well hidden, just like the base beer.
D - A very good take on a beer I already enjoyed quite a bit. Very mellow, considering the high alcohol content, but it'd be a challenge to work through an entire bottle on my own. I prefer the double vanilla and chile version I had on-tap, but I found this to be an improvement on the base beer. 1,285 charactersMasterSki, Mar 24, 2013

A- opaque very dark blackish brown, almost completely black except when held up to the light the black fades to a dark brown with ruby highlights along the upper rim. There was no head when it arrived at the table.
S- the smell is extremely complex. Lots of coconut (even though it's not listed as an ingredient), chocolate, raisin, slight almond, spice (probably the cinnamon/chile). The coconut and chocolate are the most prevalent. I didn't get any hints of barrel.
T- very rich but not cloying at all. The beer is strong and sweet, but the sweetness and alcohol are not even close to overpowering. The chile works very well balancing out the sweetness like hops usually do. All the flavors meld together in what tastes like a spiced Christmas dessert or a york peppermint pattie. Coconut, chocolate, slight spice are the main flavors. This did not much resemble a beer in a traditional sense. Again, I tasted no barrel.
M- Medium bodied. I've had thicker stouts (Ten Fidy) and thinner stouts (Breckenridge Oatmeal Stout) but it works for this beer and feels right.
O- If you're looking for a dessert beer this is really good. Given it's scarceness and price, it would be hard to have this a lot. But it tastes really good and is highly recommended for trying at least once. I was lucky enough to have two glasses and that's really all I needed for the night. It will ruin your palette for anything else after it and works very well as a dessert beer. 1,625 characters1up, Mar 20, 2013

The beer is pitch black, oily and delicious looking. There is a ring of tan head and minimal lacing, dies to mostly black liquid pretty quick. 
The smell hits all the right notes: warm cinnamon, a little alcohol from the rye whiskey barrel, tons of decadent chocolate and vanilla, blackstrap molasses, and then some caramelly sweetness over everything like a blanket of maple syrup, touch of pepper. Very nice aroma, I only wish it was bigger somehow, it seems a touch muted from the Barrel perhaps, if it was I'd approach a 5 I think.
The beer tastes great (follows the nose almost exactly), and hits a great balance of all the added elements of the base beer and the more dry effect the barrel has taken on everything. Some chili adds into the overall experience that wasn't there in the nose and some coconut as well, very nice. That said, I expected it to be more huge and over the top in the flavors there, when it was actually sort of subdued compared to other stouts with as many additions, though that doesn't mean it's not super tasty; this might be due to the feel being much thinner than I'd hoped and again I'd say the barrel has something to do with it. This thing seems like it should be thick to support all the flavors of the beer...I haven't had original beer so I can't say for sure. The carbonation is also kind of high for an imperial stout, aftertaste was actually pretty dry and muted (?)
Overall a great beer, though I'd love to try the original. This might be a case of the beer being so good already that BAing might have taken away slightly from the overall experience. 1,797 charactersDreadnaught33, Mar 19, 2013

Pours an opaque dark brown with a ring of dark mocha head and a splotchy film. Nose of booze, coconut, vanilla extract, rubbing alcohol, peppermint and cocoa. Medium thick body, light carbonation, silky texture. Rich, sweet flavor with slight bitterness and peppery heat in finish. Not as sweet as expected from nose, more balance of spice with sweet; coconut, chili pepper, cinnamon, cocoa and burning. I'm having a hard time in the finish distinguishing between bitterness, alcohol burn and pepper heat. Better than expected, but no Hunahpu.

The beer pours a lovely jet black color, very inky and viscous with a nice, tightly packed, caramel colored head, about a finger high that recedes into a nice layer of film around the glass with a touch of lace left behind. The aroma is incredible, rich chocolate, smooth whiskey, chewy oak, sweet vanilla mixes nicely with the cinnamon and pepper influence that lingers behind so nicely without getting vegetal and onion like, just the perfect amount of each to really make the chocolate forward nose more interesting. The flavors are great, loads of chocolate brownie, very rich but not overly sweet, smooth oaky whiskey with a great touch of charred barrel and smokiness behind it, vanilla and cinnamon are hand in hand giving this a lovely cinnamon sugar-esque flavor, some slight roast really amplifies the nice pepper heat at the end that lingers so nicely behind with just a touch of alcohol. The body is stellar, thick, luscious, chewy, rich, smooth, lively, it has everything going on and the finish is spectacularly silky and easy.
Verdict: Just a sublime stout from Perennial, a huge improvement over the base beer and the use of a Rye barrel was fantastic as the prickliness really compliment the spiced elements of the beer and the barrel influence is perfectly integrated into this beer. A true joy to drink and could possibly the best stout I've had to date, if not the best beer I've had to date. 1,523 characterskevanb, Mar 18, 2013

A- Pours black with a thin mocha head, leaves a bit of lacing.
S- This has to be one of the best-smelling beers I've ever had. Huge amounts of rich dark chocolate. The chocolate part of the aroma itself is crazy, smells like molten chocolate, chocolate cake, bitter and sweet dark chocolate, you get the idea. There's also a really nice vanilla and coconut aspect of the aroma, as well as cinnamon and a very subtle spicy chili aroma. The blend of spice and sweetness is really perfect. This is ridiculously good.
T- Just like the aroma, a massive and complex chocolate flavor, along with sweet coconut and vanilla, spicy cinnamon and chili. As in the aroma the chili spice is very subtle, so that it accents the chocolate, vanilla and cinnamon without overwhelming them.
M- Full-bodied, very thick and rich, mild boozy warmth at the finish.
O- This has to be one of the best stouts around. Even in the realm of spiced stouts it's up there with the best, we had this at Hunahpu day and this was at least as good as Hunahpu, if not better. 1,106 charactersWillCarrera, Mar 12, 2013

Appearance - Inky black. Glass staining. Nice khaki head. Wispy on the surface with a thick collar.
Smell - Wow nice. Lots of cinnamon. Peppers, vanilla, and chocolate. Not a lot of barrel character from it. Peanut buttery.
Taste - Peppers come through in the background throughout. Peanut butter flavor persists throughout too. Lots of chocolate and a bucket of cinnamon. Some whiskey and vanilla comes through, but not much else.
Mouthfeel - Chewy and slick. Very nice body. Peppers cut the heaviness.
Overall - Pains me to say this is just as good as Hunahpu. I wish there was more barrel, but it's hella good. 655 charactersAlieniloquium, Mar 12, 2013

Thanks for sharing this with me, DarthKostrizer!
Nearly black in body, though the very corners of the liquid are a very dark brown and auburn. Thin, but creamy dark brown head. Leaves the glass sheeted with lacing. Beautiful beer.
This is so exceptional and so unique, it's hard to actually transcribe how magnificent this actually is. I will do my best. Freshly baked Cinnabon with integrated yet expressive bourbon drizzle, along with a noticeable, yet mild, and complementary chile character. The aroma is complete, evolving, and really something quite special. I put this to my nose even more than to my mouth a) because that's the only way the beer stayed in my glass for me to enjoy, and b) it's one of the greatest aromas I've ever smelled. I'd really like Bed, Bath, and Beyond to make a Barrel-Aged Abraxas candle. They can do that, right?
The flavor is just as good as the aroma. This beer is staggering. Layers of freshly baked cinnamon rolls, mild yet delicious bourbon, just a bit of oak, complementary chile character, big cinnamon note, though complementary instead of distracting and detracting like I've encountered with other beers brewed with cinnamon. Some chocolate accents and layers of coconut, though I don't think that's an ingredient at all used in this beer. Regardless, this is incredible and effectively as good as experimental American beer can get. 
Medium to near full in body with low to moderate carbonation. Creamy. Decadent. 
About as good as beer can get. I was left speechless. 1,535 charactersehammond1, Mar 04, 2013

Bottled 1/2013.
Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, cinnamon, chile, and graham crackers. Taste is much the same with the whiskey coming through on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness and chile heat on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with an unbelievable smell and tasty flavors. 668 charactersUCLABrewN84, Feb 26, 2013

4.95/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Shared by my friend Photekut at the end of our Hill Farmstead tasting on 2/16/2013. I brought the regular Abraxas to a tasting a month or so earlier and we knew we had to get this, so thanks JR for doing that. :)
A: Looks much like the regular Abraxas, which is to say an incredibly thick dark chocolate color with a big, thick, frothy chocolate brown head. Like a melted cocoa drink from a nice chocolatier.
S: Holy shit. The smell is unbelievable. Loads of rich chocolate, vanilla, coconut, cinnamon and spicy chili. This smells like a German chocolate cake, but twice as good as any German chocolate cake could actually be. Easily as good an aroma as any beer I've had.
T: And it tastes just as good. Staggeringly rich and complex variety of flavors. Huge chocolate again, tons of vanilla, coconut, caramel, spice, oak...whiskey too but the whiskey is very subtle and seems to be doing more to transform the other flavors than to stand out in its own right. Spicy on the finish but not too much. This is just amazing.
M: Incredibly thick and rich, and yet impossible to stop drinking. We'd have finished numerous bottles of this if someone had offered them, I have no doubt.
O: This is a top five beer for me, maybe number one among stouts. Utterly amazing. I expected great things after having the regular Abraxas, but this vastly exceeded expectations. It's hard to believe how much complexity and balance the barrel aging added to this beer.

Well, up to now I've had great luck with beers (and Santana albums) with the name Abraxas. I like those odds. This stuff pours a straight obsidian topped by a finger of dark-ish tan foam. The nose comprises bourbon, roasted malts, light toasted coconut, chipotle peppers, cinnamon, light hickory smoke, and chocolate syrup. The taste holds notes of boozy bourbon, smoky peppers, brown sugar, cocoa, cinnamon, and a heavy dose of roasted malts. As damn fine as this tastes, the booziness holds it back from approaching transcendental. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly chewy feel. Overall, a damn fine brew, one whose booziness seems to be its only hindrance. Good times, indeed. 742 charactersTMoney2591, Feb 17, 2013

S: Aroma is is very complex. Chocolate, ancho, cinnamon, roasted malts, chocolate, and alcohol. 
T: Taste is also very complex. Sweet dark malts, chocolate, baking spice, ancho, cinnamon. Alcoholic, but balanced by the sweetness. As to be expected, this one really tastes very much a like a Mexican Hot Chocolate.
M: Thick, viscous, and smooth. Sweet, peppery. Lower carbonation. Very mild bitterness.
O: Yet another very nice beer.This is one that lives up to the hype. 617 charactersFlorida9, Feb 17, 2013

A Black body topped off with a nice brown head. 
S Very sweet with lots of chocolate, a bit of vanilla plus a lot of spicy cinnamon. 
T Some dark chocolate followed by a lot of cinnamon. Overall the taste of this one was one of contrasts with a lot of sweetness being balanced with some spicy cinnamon. Any barrel aging is destroyed by the rest of the flavors present.
M Full thick body with little carbonation
Overall this is an excellent stout that due to its sweetness would make an amazing desert beer. 533 charactersbeerandcycling88, Feb 11, 2013

5: Big cinnamon and anchos smothered by chocolate, roasted malt and light bourbon. 
T: Taste follows the nose very well. Big cinnamon meets chiles but that cinnamon really rivals the chiles. It provides an initial zing or spiciness which is nice, it lingers from start to finish. It provides a nice heat which smothers the alcohol heat. The chocolate and roasted base is nice and helps keep the beer in check. The bourbon is almost mute under all of the flavor which is sordove a good thing in this case. The finish is rather creamy, spicey, sweet and decadent. 
M: Full bodied, low carbonation but good for the style considering it is barrel aged. The spice and heat really coats the palate providing some staying power. Awesome.
O: Most excellent. If you dig Huna you will dig this and I really dig Huna. Amazing stout! 961 charactersbarleywinefiend, Feb 10, 2013

4.93/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5750 ml bottle poured into Southern Tier Pumking tulip.
A: Great looking pour. Pitch black with absolutely no light penetrating the glass even when held directly to a lamp. Moderate pour yields a one finger mocha head that hangs around a decent length of time given the 11% abv. Once it receded however, I didn't get any lacing.
S: I think this is one of my favorite smelling beers ever. I'm taken back to my childhood and mornings of Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal and milk. Whiskey is present yet not overpowering, perfectly integrated. Loads of vanilla too, almost like cinnamon roll icing. The stout characteristics are also apparent at the back end.
T: Wow! This is an incredibly unique and interesting beer. I don't think I've tasted anything quite like it. So much flavor in every sip. Whiskey, cinnamon, vanilla, chocolate, molasses, and chile heat are there in droves. The chile heat crept up on me just a bit as it wasn't as discernible in the nose as it is on the palate. It works nicely and adds another layer of complexity and an interesting dynamic to the beer.
M: Silky, smooth, and slightly oily on the tongue. If I have any criticism here, it is that I could have used just a bit of a thicker mouthfeel (although this one certainly isn't thin). Outside of that, the low to moderate carbonation and smoothness allow the flavors to really shine.
O: There is no doubt about it, this beer is phenomenal. There is slightly more chile heat on the tongue than I anticipated from the nose, but that adds a nice little surprise to the first sip. I do think I would like to lay another bottle down for awhile and see what happens when the chile presence fades a bit, although I don't necessarily believe it will make for a better beer, just a different beer. One of the most memorable and enjoyable beer experiences I've had. 1,834 charactersdbc5, Feb 07, 2013

Poured into a snifter from the tap at Perennial Artisan Ales on 1-26-2013. Posted from notes.
Pours a pitch-black brew that is pretty oily and viscous with a nice tan colored ring around the edge of the glass. One nice swirl produces a nice thin head. (5.0)
Aroma is amazing. Exquisite. Like fresh backed cinnamon rolls with chocolate frosting on them and some bourbon drizzled on them. The base beer notes are very present; there is some chili spice and heat in there. Amazing sweet and slightly bitter cocoa notes intermingle deliciously with some nice vanilla sweetness and some great cinnamon spice. The chocolate notes are exquisite, sweet and enticing and blend perfectly with the cinnamon. The chilies give the brew some expanded spice in the nose as well. Then there is the rye whiskey notes. Wow. Sweet honey/caramel/molasses and vanilla mixes perfectly with the base beer notes. So perfectly blended. (5.0)
The taste is wondrous. Abraxas is a great stout. The brew starts off with awesome sweetness. Cinnamon rolls a plenty. There are some awesome spice notes of cinnamon and vanilla that mingle perfectly with the chili heat and then marries perfectly with the sweet and bitter cocoa notes. All these notes play with each other so well but also shine incredibly by themselves. Now this is when this brew explodes with awesome flavor. The whiskey notes bring in another dimensions of molasses and caramel sweetness that blends with the cocoa and the vanilla and then the heat of the chilies and the spice of the cinnamon. The whiskey heat makes the brew that much more enjoyable. The chili heat mixes so well with the bourbon heat as well. Even though it spent nearly a year in the barrel it is not overwhelming. All the flavor profiles are very balanced and shine on their own. Quite complex. This beer is so velvety and silky and oily and smooth. Mouthfeel is full and perfect. (5.0)(5.0)
Overall. This beer is worth the hype. It is stunning. Very complex and if you like BA stouts you will enjoy this one. The flavors of the base beer are accentuated and the whiskey notes are delicious and present but not overwhelming. The flavor integration is flawless as well. One of the best, if not the best brew, I’ve ever had. Delicious job Perennial. (5.0) 2,304 charactersJoEBoBpr, Jan 27, 2013

very whiskey forward, first and foremost. the spices were very well integrated and blended well. the -bar aspect took the chili and cinnamon to a new level.

4.75/5  rDev +1.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75On tap at the brewery.
Pours almost pitch black, with a tiny little head. Small lacing, very dark and thick.
Smell is big on chocolate at first. It's a sweet (but not too sweet) bittersweet milk chocolate, balanced and rich. This is followed by spice from the peppers and the cinnamon, some vanilla, caramel, butterscotch, little hint of smoke. Like the most delicious whisky-soaked chocolate bar on earth.
Taste is initially that big chocolate upfront, followed by the vanilla, a tiny bit of spice from the cinnamon, and just a hint of chili kick at the finish. But each taste is different. Sometimes the spice is more prominent, sometimes the chocolate, sometimes the barrel character. Super complex, this is definitely a sipper. Each taste changes and provides new flavors, and the barrel aging is just perfectly done. It really balances the component flavors and makes them stronger, but the barrel doesn't dominate on its own. It just accentuates. The alcohol is almost non-existent, it can't be tasted but this beer will lay you flat.
Mouthfeel is motor oil thick, low carbonation, really coats the mouth so the flavors linger for days. Stunning.
Hunahpu's used to be my favorite stout, so I'm clearly a sucker for this combo of flavors. This is the new king for me though. Bravo, Perennial. The crowning achievement of the best brewery in the state. 1,361 charactersrodkin, Jan 26, 2013

Score: 100
Tap pour served in a FOBAB taster glass and enjoyed (several times) at FOBAB on 11/17/12. Later enjoyed on tap at the release, and subsequently out of the bottle. Review is from iPhone notes.
Appearance: Color is deep brown, almost black. Not much head off the small pour; just a mocha-colored ring around of the glass. Good lacing nonetheless. Out of the bottle, there is a nice layer of head with good lacing and retention. 5/5
Smell: This beer straight up smells like Cinnamon Toast Crunch, peppers and dark chocolate. There is a faint hoppiness and a light bourbon character in the background. 5/5
Taste: Tastes exactly like it smells, but with more pepper and chocolate character. The bourbon is not in-your-face. Instead, it is really well blended into the flavor profile, adding complexity without taking a prominent role. There's also a subtle vanilla throughout. Absolutely delicious and easy drinking! 5/5
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, low carbonation. The oatmeal stout base provides an awesome viscosity. Ample spice kick on the tongue with a light peppery prickliness in the throat after the swallow. 5/5
Overall: This is the absolute, unqualified best spiced stout that I have had to date, and it was easily one of the best beers at FOBAB this year. The bourbon is not very prominent, which is not par for the course, but excellent here. The Rittenhouse aging worked wonders on an already amazing beer. Cheers to Perennial for this knock out treat.
Recommendation: Seek a bottle of this out; it's better than Hunahpu's.
Pairings: Chris Gierhart's infamous homemade beef chili or some mint chocolate chip ice cream.
Cost: Unknown. 1,888 charactersjegross2, Dec 30, 2012

5/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served on tap at FoBAB. This was my favorite brew of the day. Appearance is a thick black opaque with oily appearance, a short lived cocoa head present. The aroma is simply amazing. An emphasis of cinnamon, reminiscent of cinnamon toast crunch, with heavy vanilla and bourbon in the background which smooths everything out. Notes of cocoa and chilies are present and add to the complexity of the aroma. The taste is divine. All the flavors are perfectly balanced and smooth. Cocoa comes first followed by cinnamon and vanilla. Some sweetness present with notes of Carmel and brown sugar, but the sweetness comes in harmony with the roasted malts and spices. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, very smooth. Overall, this beer is fantastic, the barrel treatment has taken this base beer above and beyond. If you are lucky enough, be sure to try this!!
Addendum:
I am currently drinking this in its bottled form and felt the need to edit this review to a perfect 5 across the board. At FoBAB, there is definitely an issue of palate fatigue with all the delicious beers being served. Having this one on its own confirms that this is the best beer I've ever had. The chocolate pops with heavy waves of coconut and a more notable heat at the back, more so than I remember at FoBAB. Simply delicious. 1,291 charactershomebrew311, Dec 08, 2012
